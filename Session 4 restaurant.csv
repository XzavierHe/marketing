"Burger King","Whenever I go to a chain restaurant, there's a certain kind of quality for the food I expect. Each time I go to this location, I always end up asking myself why I don't go elsewhere. Not to say the food is bad, but it's a bit subpar from what I have come to expect from a Burger King. It's conveniently by the airport if you need a quick bite, but at times, it will take a randomly long time to get your food.

Overall, it's not a bad place, but just beware the food may be a a bit worse than you expect and may take a while to arrive, even when you're the only person in the store.","2/9/2020",1
"Burger King","Still in disgust of what I just put in my mouth! 
Fries had a weird taste from the beginning 
The burger was dry cold and bread split as I took the first few bites. 
Once I opened the burger to actually look inside 
I was filled with disgust 
guac spread was dark brown 
Lettuce was soggy 
I am honestly speechless and can't process the fact that someone would actually let go of something like this in any chain Restaurant 
Called the restaurant 
Not a very welcoming voice answered 
Burger King! 
I followed to ask why I was serve this in disgust 
The whole meal was off 
All she replied 
Our BROILER broke 
You can come get a refund in the morning when the GENERAL MANAGER IS HERE! 

The fact that the broiler broke does not give any establishment to serve any food that is not up to restaurant quality 

I am still in disbelieve of what just happened 
I will be contacting and taking this issue further if I find myself with any health issues! 
FOOD SHOULD NEVER BE SERVED 
CITY SHOULD MAKE A FEW ROUNDS TO AN ESTABLISHMENT LIKE THIS!","7/4/2022",0
"Burger King","Food was made fresh! I got my sumn usual Texas double whopper , no bacon and a Hi- C no ice. Staff was friendly and attentive. Pretty crowded area given the fact that there's a Chick-fil-A next door. Good location otherwise.","8/17/2021",1
"Burger King","This Burger King is a joke I waited in line for 20min just to see that I didn't get my order correctly they gave me fries instead of onion rings knowing that I asked that If it was onion rings do not shop here it's a joke paying extra and not even getting the order right","5/28/2021",2
"Burger King","I'm giving one star because I have to rate something. This location is the worst. The employees are very rude. They never have even half of the menu. I just went to get a chicken sandwich because I was craving one and they didn't have that, didn't have fries, or any burgers. They only had nuggets. It took her 5 minutes to answer on the speaker box just to tell me they didn't have anything. She was really rude as she was telling me. I won't waste my time coming to this location anymore. I'll never be back. Just close the whole store already.","2/5/2022",0
"Burger King","Twice I placed an order for this location using the Burger King app, only to find the location was closed after my order was accepted and purchased.  The first time was after 9pm, but tonight it was 6pm Saturday and they were already closed.  Apparently they have major staffing issues here, but they should at least have deactivated online ordering for their location if they were going to be closed.  Thankfully addressing the issue through Customer Service via the app was helpful in canceling the orders and reimbursing me, but this location seriously needs to be investigated.","12/4/2021",0
"Burger King","Went on weeknight a couple weeks ago and the dining room was closed at 7pm. There were several people in the drive thru, and based on the reviews I'm glad I didn't. I sent a complaint to corporate and never heard a peep from the location manager, but a survey for the time it took to respond to my complaint. They never addressed it, they just wanted a response to the canned response email I received from corporate they would look into it. Never looked into it because I never got a response at all. I hate to say it, but this location is doomed if they don't change.","6/19/2021",1
"Burger King","I. Don't. Know. Why. This. Burger King. Store. Has Drama. But. It. Does. Well perhaps part of the problem seems to be lack of how to properly handle basic guest relations.  An experienced restaurant manager would of contacted me to explain the situation. One simple conversation not had,  created bigger problems. When companies hire cheaper, unqualified staff to save revenue, unfortunately, sadly, they lack basic hospatility, aka CUSTOMER SERVICE and professionalism. You pay low wages, you will get low skills. 

Broiler broke down and they kept me waiting 20 minutes for a simple chicken salad. With attitude to boot. Not another person in line. 

Because as I tried to explain to the manager and her crew, it's not the broiler breaking down that made my experience horrible. Yeah, it sucks waiting 20 minutes for a 2 minute salad. But seriously. Had she just came outside where I was waiting to apologize for the long wait and offer a coupon or free dessert. Boom. It would of changed the entire dynamic. INSTANTLY!!! Because, it's not what happens, but rather how things are handled in the recovery of things going sideways.

And you can try to teach people they need to be customer service orientated.  But if they don't care, feel under appreciated by their employer, or struggle financially from low wages and high stress work. Boom. Associates will never take or make the time to do the right, basic steps. My personal intuition tells me there are alot of internal problems with this store and company. It is need of a major overhaul. 

Stay away if you expect cooked food, service, or value. Just saying.","5/17/2018",12
"Burger King","WORST BURGER KING ---  Went there on Saturday and waited and waited and waited in the Drive thru only one car in front of me. After about 10 minutes and no movement I decided to leave, as I was leaving I noticed that there were NO other cars in the line leading up to the window so where was the person who was supposed to be talking orders?
Won't be returning to this Burger King.","1/10/2021",0
"Burger King","Only thing I have to say is, worst Burger King I've ever been too. The food was nasty. Don't go there even if you are starving. I would not recommend this place to anyone.","9/12/2021",0
"Burger King","Worlds worst $5 burger...

Soggy bun, white lettuce thrown-on haphazardly, tiny orange tomato slice, paper thin tasteless patty - absolutely disgusting! Why are these places still open with so many other better choices? 

Plus, the building smells and it's dirty. The only good thing about the place were the people. They were nice and smiled, but I would not call the service exceptional.

Can't recommend and will never ever be back!","3/29/2018",1
"Burger King","Stay far far away from this Burger King I decide to come to this drive-through because the Chick-fil-A line was so long I was second in line at the drive-through and it took 20 minutes to get my food,  all the cars had cleared a Chick-fil-A by the time I receive my food. I am not sure why I didn't read the reviews first but definitely is a one star Burger King and it should not even be in business.  Everyone is very slow here and it's just awful

***PAY ATTENTION*** if you try to come to this Burger King when Chick-fil-A is very busy you will have a difficult time maneuvering in and out of Burger King thus  making your stay even longer than you want to be there.","11/12/2019",0
"Burger King","Worst food ever. Threw up all day today after eating breakfast here. It tasted awful and I am now feeling very  sick. The lady working the window was very nice though.","7/27/2021",0
"Burger King","This Burger King is uncomprehendingly horrible. I work in the restaurant industry and my interactions here are literally the worst i have ever experienced. 

I have been going here the past 3 years and just the past 3 months has had a huge downfall. Corporate really needs to reevaluate their associates. My husband tried to get me food the other night and the employees were fighting, he only got half our order and they wouldn't return our money. Just now they told me the system was down and the associate was so rude she didn't care that their was a long line of cars, when I asked how long it would take since I was willing to patiently wait she rudely told me she didn't know and didn't care. There are too many other fast food joints by them, I would recommend never going here. 

Corporate PLEASE evaluate your store on Mockingbird!","6/8/2019",1
"Burger King","I am very sorry. But the drive up was unusable. There speaker setup sounded the the guy on the other end was underwater. After several attempts to place an order, I just left. Terrible.","8/12/2020",0
"Burger King","In line at windows to order for 10 minutes, paid and waited for almost 15 minutes to get my food and no one in line but me. It's 5:16 pm on a Sunday. What's going on here?!? Dinning in restaurants don't take that long.","1/26/2020",0
"Burger King","So after seeing the king in those commercials lately I decided to grab a bite from this bk. Hit the drive thru for a spicy chicken sandwich, whopper, fries and a coke. Lady in the drive thru wasn't rude or anything but she sure seemed like she didn't want to be there. I only wish she would have offered me cheese on my burger and hope she had a better day. The only good part about my meal was the coke and fries. Burger patty was cold (disgusting) and the spicy chicken patty was dry (as if it had been under a heat lamp to long.) The service was fast, don't get me wrong but the quality was horrible. Management needs to get ahold of this location. Or the District Manager should find someone that values not only the customer service, but the overall quality of the food being served. Bk down.","11/16/2019",0
"Burger King","Typical Burger King, however this location has something special. Cold breakfast sandwiches and rude employees. Tried the new taco, it's why you got 2 stars instead of 1. Jack in the box is better though. And since your staff is rude that's where I'm getting mine. Sorry.","8/1/2019",0
"Burger King","Oh, Burger King. Once a shining beacon of fast food, the great rival to McDondald's has since fallen. But with standard fast food offerings, decent service and great deals on chicken nugs, maybe one day it will return to its former glory.

Not much to say about this particular location. The staff is friendly and the speed of service is decent. I've driven thru the few times I've been and usually went for the chicken nugget promotion going on right now (10 nuggets for the cheap price of $1.50).

If you want to eat things that may or may not have once been chicken, you may as well make a stop here.","3/17/2015",1

"Burger King","FOOD POISONING on June 26, 2018!! 

Severe vomiting within 20 minutes of leaving here. Had a fever that evening into the next day. Never could reach management by phone at the store, so I notified the corporate office and the Dallas Health Inspector. Within a week, the city  investigation noted several violations. 

I know it's not fine dining or a healthy food choice...but I also don't expect to become severely ill minutes after eating a burger from a well known fast food chain. 

Stay away!!!","8/30/2018",2
"Burger King","Food is fresh, service is fast and polite. They messed up the order, but it got corrected right away.","8/4/2016",3
"Burger King","HORRIBLE! Waited 20 mins for freaky bacon cheese tators. The girls working the drive thru and the front counter were trying but whoever was back in the kitchen was too playful and didn't give a damn. Several customers waited for extended period of time. Somebody back in that kitchen needs to go!","5/7/2019",0
"Burger King","My food was delicious. The employee who took my order was patient when I changed my mind, my fries were hot and perfectly seasoned. By Whopper was made to order. Y'all even had my fave Seagrams raspberry ginger ale! Thank you!","6/21/2020",0
"Burger King","Worst Burger King experience ever. Showed up at 10:40pm CST to make an order at the drive thru. Noticed rocks in the drive thru lane...thought it was a joke so I removed them. Proceeded to drive through to make an order when the lady on the mic stated they were closed. I asked what time they close and she told me 11pm CST. I asked how it was that they were closed at 10:40pm when 20 minutes still reminded. She stated they had stuff to clean and that's why they closed early. I don't understand the reason for Open and Close times if this is the case. She even went so far as to state that they placed the rocks in the drive thru to stop people from coming to order. From a service, business and customer service standpoint I have never been more disappointed.","7/19/2018",1
"Burger King","Service is soooooo slow. Waited 30 minutes for a simple meal. Appeared to be fully staff, but poorly trained.","7/3/2019",0
"Burger King","So here I am at a Burger King.  I've had nothing but bad food the pst few times but...I had to go the the restroom...bad!  Lol. What does that have to do with anything?  Well, this one is by the airport and the sign said for customers only.  For lack of better judgement, I ordered a whopper jr and a drink.  Waited and waited...no burger.  Finally went up front to ask and the counter guy said he didn't save my ticket number which I had been listening for but had called out for a whopper.  My bad, didn't hear him.  The manager immediately came up to the counter and said she had seen me sitting there the whole time...what did I order?  I told her a whopper jr and she told me to give her a minute and she would take cate of me.  Boy did she!  Fresh hot whopper like I had back in the day when Burger King rocked!  YUM!  She even added a large fries and asked if I wanted dessert.  I thanked her and said I appreciated her service.  WOW!  Impressive!","12/28/2019",0
"Burger King","I came in only for the 2 for $6! No where to park because of Chick-fil-A that was just built across the lot and across from the airport. While I was in line to get my order this guy from the street comes rollin' in and looked like he hasn't washed in days. He takes out of his bag a dirty Quik Trip cup and starts rinsing at the coke machine while the rim of the cup keeps rubbing up against where the ice and all drink flavors disperses from the machine. Mind you the cup was not and is not made for it so he forced his cup to get whatever he wanted. I told the lady who took my order and she said oh no, but looked shook her head and didn't do anything about it. I told her I'm not getting my drink from that machine when Mr. Funk Nasty is using a dirty cup from his dirty bag and the street. Unsanitary! Got my coke from behind the counter. These bums come in and just funky up the place and come into these eating establishments with their funk filth. Will not be returning.","8/9/2018",0
"Burger King","I mean it's fast food, what do you expect. Employees treat you like you made them get a job there. Very short with you, no smiles, no respect. My order cam out right but had obviously been sitting there awhile. Larger black lady in drive through basically threw my bag of food at me and said here you go. I said Thank you very much with a smile she wouldn't look me in the eye and then slammed the window shut. You applied there people not us, if you don't want to work there then quit.","4/21/2018",0
"Burger King","Good food.  Horrible service.  Unfriendly and rude staff.  Going to complain and hopefully the staff learns how to treat people with respect.  If you wanna get an ugly stare and mad look. This place is for you.","5/2/2018",0
"Burger King","The drive thru is six cars deep and the line in the dining room is six couples standing on line at the counter and Burger King has two associates on duty. One working the front counter & drive thru and a cook. This is unbelievable. I am surprised that the owners of this Burger King do not care anymore about it then the only have two Associates on duty and I'm sure they are paying them a minimum wage. I will not be back.","5/13/2017",0

"Burger King","DO NOT go to this Burger King. I have never been treated as rudely at a restaurant as I was treated here. I really needed to use the bathroom at 9:30 the other night, so I stopped at the closest restaurant. I was going to buy something to pay for my use of their facilities, but using the bathroom was my first priority. After stepping one foot in the building, an employee who was mopping the floor looked at me and barked, The restroom is closed. I explained that I REALLY needed to use it, and he said, Well I REALLY need to clean it, and proceeded to give me mouth about paying customers and other nonsense (especially since I was going to buy something). So I took my business to another restaurant who would let me use their facilities. When I went back to explain to the manager why I was never going to come here again, I stepped one foot in the door and the same employee yelled, This guy again! Somebody take care of him! and stormed out of the building. Completely ridiculous! I will never support a business that has such little regard for its customers.","1/15/2020",0
"Burger King","I came here just because Seattle'a Best coffee. Yeah I know, I'm coming to a fast food joint to get a coffee. 

After waiting 5-10 minutes I got an iced coffee.

But hold the phone!!!! I didn't order an iced coffee. I ordered a large mocha frap. And got a small iced coffee after waiting that long.

CAN I GET SOME COFFEE WITH MY ICE???????

Get your crap together. Your job isn't difficult.","9/7/2013",0

"Burger King","In a town with over-hyped barbecue and over-priced burgers, I found sanctuary at this little Burger King. Man it was so good. Not the greatest neighborhood but man what a quick and friendly staff. I ordered 2 cheeseburgers and got three! Bonus plan!","12/4/2012",1
"Burger King","ZERO STARS.   On my way to Love Field, I made a stop here to get a milkshake.   I went into the drive thru and waited for someone to greet me and take my order.  So I waited about a minute - still no one.  So i drove around to the window and there was no one in the window, but I could clearly see a young African American lady working behind the counter in the main part of the store.   It appeared that she was with a customer.      And she looked over at me...  Without question - she knew i was there.  

Then there was a young Mexican lady who came over to the window not to greet me, but to do something near the soda fountain.  She looked right at me and then walked off!

i'm just sitting there in my car waiting.  For a second i thought the young Afrrican American lady was coming to help because she walked towards my direction and again looked at me and again completely ignored me.   Either one of these ladies could have at least said she would be with me in a minute Or the drive thru was closed Or SOMETHING. 

I drove off.   This was rather frustrating to say the least.   

Thank you Yelp for giving me the opportunity to warn others.  

*****  PLEASE SPEND YOUR MONEY SOMEWHERE ELSE!","7/6/2012",1
"Burger King","I stopped in for the premotional Angry Whopper with sweet potato curly fries... call me crazy.. but it was pretty darn good. They were fairly quick, and the food hit the spot. I usually avoid all fast food.. and Burger King has no special place in my heart.. but this was actually surprising enough I figured I'd say 'thanks' via this review.","11/30/2012",0
"Burger King","Zipped by to pick up a late night burger snack and no line at the drive through.  I was in a hurry and decided on the standard Number 1 with Cheese no onions.  I pulled up to the window where I was informed they were out of Coke. (How does a large world wide chain run out of the leading soft drink??? I'm a supply chain type and that boggles my burger fed brain.) I picked something and they had me on my way quickly.

A couple of miles later, I'm opening the bag to pull out the order to find undercooked fries and a well wrapped burger.  Once into the wrapping, I find a cold bun with a nearly warm patty.  Had it been a longer drive, I could have understood the heat loss through heat conduction. But with the exceptional wrapping work done by the staff, which removes heat loss by convection, hmmm...    I guess I'll chalk this one as I shouldn't order late at night when there isn't a rush of other customers to make sure the BK processes are followed.

I'll be back as there are just those moments I have a desire for a BK burger.","7/27/2017",10
"Burger King","I ordered a Whopper meal, no onions, no ketchup, with a sprite. Two out of the three tomatoes were old and so was the lettuce. It was awful. This is my favorite fast food meal and I'm absolutely disgusted. The burger also didn't have any mayonnaise so it was completely dry. So grossed out and disappointed.","8/6/2022",0
"Burger King","Service was poor. I forget to order a drink with my sandwich and  when I got to window and pick up food, I say like to order a drink as I forgot to do so. The woman rudely said I need to get back in line, other words drive around reorder the drink. At that moment I look in the rear view mirror and there was only  1 car behind me and no other cars in line. She stated it was there policy not to accept order at this window.  To give me a drink take what 2 minutes.  Probably last time I go here as she had an altitude. If she didn't already have my credit card for payment, I would've  left that $7 dollar sandwich at the window. This poor service was over a $1.70 drink.","12/9/2022",0
"Burger King","I ordered the veggie burger meal. It was super cold in the middle of the patty and the patty was generally cold all around the rim. If I wasn't in a rush I would have gone back to get my money back. 10/10 do NOT recommend this location.","12/13/2021",0
"Burger King","At 10 PM they got my order wrong and charged me the wrong amount for the other order. I wish I could have transcribed the preposterous conversation I had with the window worker. They charged me for the wrong order and then said it's okay it's basically the same price as the car behind you. (I ordered a spicy ch'king and two rodeo burgers) she said there were McNuggets in there because they ran out of the other chicken. Then her coworker said they ran out of all chicken. She said it already charged the card and asked if I wanted a refund. Just a cluster, maybe I should stick to the day crew after reading the rest of these comments.","6/23/2022",0

"Burger King","I came here Wednesday night on 02/09/2022 to pick up a food order I ordered on their APP. This was around 10:10pm the App told me I had until Midnight to pick it up before store closed. The lights were off when I got there but a car was in front of me in the drive-thru so I assumed only the drive-thru was opened sat there for about 15 minutes and a young lady comes out and says they are closed, when I told her that I had already paid for my food, she stated sorry its nothing she could do because they were closed. She then proceeded to get in her car and drive off. I will never order from a Burger King App or visit this location. This is second Burger King location that has just closed while I was in the drive thru. It must be a corporate policy not to have to follow listed business hours.","2/11/2022",0
"Burger King","Says they're open until midnight. Lights are on but nobody home. Look Burger King if you're going to state hours until midnight and offer delivery, but close early and leave your lights on to trick people your open, what's the point of even posting hours or having a restaurant? I saw three cars come in behind me, all tricked. 
I drove several miles to get here ya know! Its not like I live next door and can see you closed early. Your decisions are wasting people's time and fuel. And why keep your sign and menu lights on? now your wasting electricity too! if your sign would've been off I would've known you were closed and not entered to begin with. instead i'm like hello...hello?
Canes isn't complaining they're getting all the BK business. waffle house too.","7/20/2020",1

"Burger King","I can't believe they still open! Fast food really ain't terribly difficult. You place your order pay for and get your the food you ordered. That's the expectation. This burger king can't do THIS. Its always something. Today they got ppl inside with the doors locked. So it's closed with the exception of the 2 families inside eating their dinner at 830 on a Saturday night. It's just silliness.","3/14/2020",2

"Burger King","I tried to contact manager 2x with not response. Bought 2 orders of nuggets on Sunday and when I got 1/2 thru the first bag I went to dip the piece again I had just bitten and saw something sticking out of it. It was a feather! I took a picture of it to show them. Threw all the nuggets away and I don't think I trust burger king anymore. The address is 5119 Ross Ave, Dallas, TX.

The other times, I was told at the drive thru that it's shift change and they couldn't help me. Tonight, the cook's not here yet. It occurs to me that the night shift here is trying to sabotage the business. Man, just close if you can't find decent night workers.","1/13/2018",2

"Burger King","Usually a great place to eat.  But went tonight at 8:30 and all lights were on and people sitting inside and eating. Doors locked and people who worked there drawing a slashing movement across their neck at me when I tried to come in.   What gives?","12/18/2016",3
"Burger King","actually very clean, and workers are very friendly. it was built this year and so far it has been kept satisfied for me and my family; i really like their chicken fries and I like how my fries are always on point.","6/10/2016",0
"Burger King","I typically avoid Burger King, this location in particular I've never had good luck at. Today I was vulnerable and lucky me it was the best experience I've ever had at a Burger King ever. We were greeted by a friendly guy on the loud speaker in the drive thru who was patient and accommodating while I ordered.. and then changed my order. He just rolled with it. I came to the window and to my surprise the dedication of this guy. He even had a crown tattooed on his neck! Obviously he has pledged his allegiance to Burger King with this symbol. Super friendly and chatting us up while they finished our order. We ordered the two whopper deal, with fries and drinks and it was perfect. One with no onions, the other with no pickles, hot and fresh fries, and a side of charm I never expected. I couldn't have asked for a better experience at Burger King. Thank you!!","9/12/2021",0

"Burger King","There are times I crave the taste of Burger King Hamburgers. This is the closest BK to me.  When it first opened, it was pretty good for production line fast food. Since then, not so much.

This trip, still not so much. 

I was craving the standard Whopper with cheese and no onion and saw none were in the drive thru so up to the order spot I drove!  Simple order, Whopper, no onion with cheese and a small coke.  I pulled around. I paid.  I waited a few and burger was handed out.  I had to remind the window worker about the drink.  Since she forgot, she upgraded me to a medium. Off I drove.

The burger I received was a double meat, no cheese WITH onion.  It also had no lettuce, no pickles, no tomato and was dry.  Had I not already been at the house, I would have gone back. 
 
No wonder there was no one in line. I should have checked it before I pulled away. It was showing a 1.5 star rating.","4/24/2019",25
"Burger King","WTF is wrong with you one star givers?
This place is great- was running late for a flight and had to blast through the drive through- picked up a Whopper, soft serve and two BK crowns for the airplane- all Bussin..","5/24/2021",0
"Burger King","Wow - the worst customer service I have ever seen.  They take their sweet time filling your order in the drive thru, then they get it wrong.   Really bad - so bad that you can go here if you want to get verbally abused and badgered.  I've thought of some amusing responses to make, but they just don't care.  Every person who has helped me here is terrible, so this must include the manager.  Can't believe the franchise owner puts up with this.","3/3/2022",0
"Burger King","Won't give a rating because the Customer Service was a Negative! The Manager argued with me that My Impossible patties that I purchased were Not burnt!... She argued with me that that's the way the Impossible Patties look.  I've had SEVERAL Impossible patties before and I am a Foodie so I KNOW burned food when I see it! Decided to just get a refund after she stormed off when I told her I still want my food just not Burned!!  WILL NOT RETURN!!

SN: have to give a rating since I can't post without it","6/13/2020",2
"Burger King","Who owns this franchise, they are not properly staffing this place. At most I have seen two employees working at once, many times a week they shut down the drive through since they don't have enough employees to operate. I feel terrible for the staff but there needs to be a change in management. Worst run BK in Dallas.","8/22/2021",1
"Burger King","Don't even think about visiting this place.  I love veggie burgers and sometimes would buy one from BK in a fit of desperation.  

I walked into BK today to return an error in my order from the drive thru.  The cashier gave me the corrected sandwich and placed the error sandwich INTO THE HEAT LAMP AREA for later use.  I told her that I opened and touched the sandwich so it should be tossed.  She ignored me and so did the manager.

I learned tonight that BK has the highest rate of sanitary violations for fast food restaurants.

I am done with BK veggie burgers.","4/7/2018",3
"Burger King","Spent 5-6 min waiting in front of the monitor drive through and no one even buzzed in to acknowledge me . So I figured it may have been broken (which happens ) so I pulled in line with 3 cars ahead of me . 10-15 min later I finally pull up to the window and the guy asked if I ordered to which I replied that I never got to order . He then laughed amusingly and said they were busy and that's why he told me to wait . First of all no one told me anything . I wasn't even acknowledged. I'm glad to think he finds it funny that they are upsetting customers and can't keep up with the rush . He then told me he couldn't take my order . That's right , the guy with the headset taking drive through orders said he couldn't take my order . I mean what's the difference in me telling him at the monitor versus at the window seeing as how no one even attempted to take my order or  tell me to please wait . Totally a wait of my time and very unprofessional!","2/27/2022",0

"Burger King","I don't frequent fast food joints, but I must say that in the past year I've come to this location twice, and both times something was screwed up in the drive-through lane. 
The first time, something was wrong with their register, or their gift card program, and they were only able to take cash. Second time, the intercom was broken, and they required you to place your order at the window. First world problems I know, but their batting a thousand on inconveniences to customers. Maybe it's time to spend some money on the infrastructure?","1/18/2018",2

I could keep going about all the horrible things I've experienced but Everyone is so rude!","11/22/2020",0
"Burger King","Made an order for four impossible patties. The cashier was very confused with the order but I did get my burgers.  When I received the burgers they were burnt. Did not realize that until I got them home. Took them back up to the store gave them to the manager and showed her that they were burnt. I explained to her that they are burnt she exclaimed over and over that they were not burnt but that that's the way they are when they come off of the fire. I said I've had them before these are burnt she said again they are not. I said can I get more she said this is the way they are I said can I get my money back because she had an attitude I was afraid to get more. It took about 10 minutes for her to figure out how to give me a refund but I did get my refund. Will I go back to that Burger King to get my impossible whoppers ... NEVER.","6/13/2020",0
"Burger King","I'm surprised this establishment is still open. I've been made fun of for writing bad Yelp reviews on fast food restaurants; but come on everyone needs to be held accountable for bad service. I came in the drive through and ordered two bacon cheeseburgers because I had a by one get one coupon, so I added spicy chicken nuggets cause I was having a fat attack. She said sorry we don't sell spicy nuggets no more I said  ok thats cool I get the regular but they had all the advertisements up all over the place that they still sell them. Oh well. Anyways so I handed her the coupon and she said and I quote  next time you have a coupon let us know you have a one at the intercom because it messes up up and I have to delete everything and rering you up I missed the part of how that is the customer at fault or my problem for that matter. So I asked for my receipt because I wanted a corporate number she said it doesn't work so yeah now I remember why I haven't had Burger King in two years. I'll try again in another two years.","11/5/2017",2
"Burger King","I should have driven the extra 10 minutes to In and Out. I'm trying really hard not to judge this place harshly because it is a fast food restaurant and I shouldn't expect a 5 star service but I was in a hurry and this was the first thing I saw on the way. 

So I pull up and order a #1, which is the Whopper and so the girl working asks me if that was all, and I told her no I would also care for a drink and fries. Well she then proceeds to tell me Thanks second window and as I'm driving over there I realize she never asked me what kind of drink I wanted. No big deal, she'll probably ask me when I get to the window. Sadly she did not, she hands me my drink and when I ask what it was she tells me it's a coke. Oh... okay, I was going to ask for a Sprite but I'm not picky, I'm at Burger King clearly, so a coke is fine. Well, I pay for my meal and drive off. 

My biggest issue here wasn't the 7 fries I got with my order or the fact the coke tasted weird, but my burger, the whopper, was COLD. Correct me if I'm wrong, but even fast food burgers are supposed to be at least warm. Get it together. This place honestly sucks. Take your money and go somewhere else.","9/30/2015",1
"Burger King","I came here on a Tuesday around 10pm and waited 15 mins by the window. Some Hispanic girl came to the window and said we closed, and I said I thought you guys were 24 hrs.

"Burger King","This review is based solely on our visit today, usually they do a relatively good job.  Anyway, the cashier (dressed like management) - Maria P,  took our order.  We asked for cheese on both burgers and jalapeños on one.  We paid, then stepped over to the drink machine while waiting for our order.  The machine wasn't working, not even ice!  So my wife tells the counter help, and she cops an attitude telling us it is working.  Another girl came out and pressed the ice lever, and sure enough, it didn't work.  They seemed perturbed having to fill our cups.  She shoves the tray at us, and my wife asks for a couple of ranch dressings - she likes it with her fries - to which Maria P says, I'll have to charge you 25 cents each .  Well, that was a first.  Then my wife asked for Sweet n Low for her tea, and again Maria P copped an attitude.  My wife remarked, I hope these are free.  When we unwrapped our burgers, no cheese, even though she had read our order back to us.

We ate there, and during the 30 minutes we were there, several disgruntled customers came and went.  At one point, the two counter girls came out and sat at a table and stared at their phones, even allowing one couple to stand and wait to order.

I've never had fast food service this terrible.....and these are the people demanding $15 an hour?  Pah-leez.","10/11/2015",1
"Burger King","This Burger King is very unorganized and the franchise owner should start from scratch on employees.  I just left there, the sign says it opens at 6 am. So to my surprise the door was locked. I heard someone come out the back door so I walked around.  It was an employee,  I asked her what time do they open she said I don't know. Then she asked someone else who supposedly didn't know either. She then told me 7am. I asked why did the sign say 6am she again said I don't know. This isn't the only time I've had to deal with the unprofessional staff of this burger king. Last week I went in and ordered breakfast a sandwich and hash browns. The manager took the hash browns that the young lady who was serving me put to the side while she waited on my sandwich.  The manager then went and sat down and had breakfast. I had to wait until more hash browns were cooked.  But, today will be the last.","7/5/2015",1
"Burger King","This past Saturday (2/25/17) about 6:30 pm.  I went through the drive thru and repeated my order six times.  After they repeated the order and verifying the screen.  I thought they'll get it right no problem.  I pull up to the second window to pay, initially my gut said check your order.  However I tried to give them the benefit of the doubt.  I get home and my order is completely wrong.  I am doubt found how someone can still mess up an order.  I go back and the cashier wants to be a smart ass about this.  I will not recommend this location, its obvious they don't care.  If I could give this location a zero, I would!","2/28/2017",1

There aren't signs of emergency closing. The second time I heard someone laughing, so it was intentional.

The cashier had the sniffles and after rubbing his hands on his nose he bagged the food/fries for another customer. He looked to have bad hygiene, dirty uniform. Sagging pants with dirty underwear showing. I canceled my order after seeing they were behind making me think i was gonna have to wait longer.

When we first arrived, the young cashier obviously didn't care about their job. I gave him a $50 bill and asked for change, and he took out his phone for calculations, but his phone was dead. He had to ask his coworker for a simple math equation. as a math professor at a local catholic school. Even the 3rd graders I taught knew how to solve that equation with their head...  My grandson complained about the  food after we ate. The cheap  Burger King crown ripped when he put it on his head. He cried so much that we had to leave the  restaurant ... While we were leaving,  the workers laughed at us, including the manager..

She said what right into my face extremely loud and all of the customers got stunned. Not even an apology.  I mean how could u behave like this in front of customers.

"Burger King","After visiting this location I was skeptical of visiting. Now after visiting this BK I am shockingly in agreement with the previous reviews.  I drove through the drive thru and placed my Peter then proceeded to the first window.  This place has two windows, one for payment and then second for order pick up. So I drove to the first window and was greeted by (Tim) who took my money then told me to wait here till someone waved me to the next window to pick up my food. Usually you pay then drive to the pick up window to clear the payment window.  After thinking about this and being confused as to why they wanted me to wait to be waved onto the next window, I proceeded to the pick up window.  I looked into that pick up window and saw a shift manager and two employees just laughing away and goofing off inside. (Now I know why they didn't want me to pull up). Tim came to the window and said,  um next time you need to wait at the other window unless we will make you go back and wait there. I then asked Tim if this was BK new policy and he said,Well if you want your food hot and right, you will wait where we tell you.  This is definitely the last time I visit this BK.  With this kind of customer service I have no clue how they are still open.  After exiting the drive thru I looked into the dinning area and it was empty.  I wonder why?  Anyway, this wonderful experience was also passed onto corporate BK in hopes they are able to improve this location.","2/20/2017",2

"Burger King","~ Coronavirus version ~

Fairly average for Burger King. I went to try the Impossible Whopper (finally!) and picked up some nuggets, which are greatly priced here at 10 for $1.50.

The Impossible Whopper was alright--it looked and smelled like a regular Whopper but the meat was pretty dry. It didn't give that same juiciness as meat and it was pretty noticeable that it was vegetarian. It did have some liquid smoke / smoke flavor to help make it taste a bit meatier, but it felt overdone and every bite was full of a smoky flavor.

The nuggets were great, like they usually are. My only qualm was that we ordered 40 (mobile order of $4.99 for 40!) , and at first glance, we got 4 pouches or presumably 10 each, but on further inspection when I got home, there were only 8 in each so we ended up short several.","5/30/2020",0

"Burger King","All right first time I gave a rating I just gave him four stars typical Burger King well I've been back twice since then and I've had two bad experiences.  We're going to drop them down to two stars I have one more bad experience we'll give them one star.  Please check your receipt I ordered two impossible Whoppers extra mayo a large drink which they charge about three bucks for a drink came out to $10.59 which I thought I was ordering the 10 piece nuggets for $1.49.  of course that wasn't the order even though I saw it on the screen check your receipts check your receipts check your receipts.","6/22/2021",0
"Burger King","Drive through Menu look like it was shattered by a baseball bat upon arriving which was kind of a red flag from the get go. Food didn't taste fresh and wasn't very tasty neither. Staff was very pleasant however which was an upside .","11/23/2021",0
"Burger King","Besides having slow drive-through service, this BK made my husband's Texas Whopper burger wrong. It was a very simple customization. When he went in for it to be fixed, they gave him another wrong order... this time left off his bacon. When we paid $20 for two people to eat, that's not reasonable. My husband just gave up and ate it, but the moral is CHECK YOUR ORDER BEFORE YOU LEAVE.
Also their milk shake machine was broken.","10/11/2020",0
"Burger King","I can honestly say I will never be back to this Burger King. I was the only person there and still had to wait 10 minutes for my order. I ordered a chicken sandwich meal and the entire meal was inedible. The fries tasted weird, even though they were fresh. The soda didn't even taste like a Dr. Pepper and had a weird aftertaste. It almost tasted like old socks! The chicken sandwich was overcooked, but didn't even taste like chicken. Two bites in and I had to thrown it away. The whole meal was disgusting. 

I don't recommend going here at all.","9/4/2017",0
"Burger King","Just got home from ordering here & they completely missed my order. Ordered 2 for $6 Whopper & Original Chicken sandwich, Med fries & onion rings, 10 pc nuggets, & a Hershey pie. I didn't get my nuggets, and they gave me what looks like the Parmesan chicken instead of the original chicken sandwich, & I got 2, more like 1 medium & 1 small fries instead of my medium onion rings. Very disappointed & hubby's not happy either cuz he didn't get his chicken sandwich. They took FOREVER too! It's the weekend, you should have more ppl working. Place is highly not recommended.","8/25/2017",0
"Burger King","Been here twice in 2 days and both times they were closed well past the posted opening time.

One day no one was inside, and the next day the guy said they open at 8. Posted time is 7.

Not even worth the frustration.","12/2/2018",0
"Burger King","THE HALLOWEEN WHOPPER aka the black Whopper, or HA1LOWEEN WHOPPER.

This review is about the Halloween Whopper sandwich with black-colored A1 steak sauce-infused buns. Burger King did a great job with this promotion, especially with such a novel product...imagine, a burger with black-colored buns. They actually have black-colored buns in Japan, but I'm not spending thousands on a plane ticket to a country renowned for their raw fish and natural foods. Having this black-bun Whopper in the U.S. is a more suitable fit. Plus, it is much cheaper.

The Appearance: MY STOMACH DON'T WANT NONE, UNLESS YOU GOT BLACK BUNS HUN. 
You want to try something that you have never seen before. WHY? Because you want to try something that others haven't yet tried. You want to post pictures on social media or brag to others that you consumed it. Or, maybe you're intrigued and curious. There is something sleek and avant-garde about changing the traditional burger. Most cooks would change the composition of the meat (bison burger anyone?) or add unconventional toppings (how about some fried green tomatoes or sriracha aioli?). But to change the color of the bun from recognizable tan to jet black and to infuse the bun with A1 steak sauce? This might be American heresay, but this could be a burger revolution. 

The Food: CLASSIC WHOPPER WITH A REMIX.
My first bite reminded me of my first Whopper: charbroiled beef patty dominating the taste buds; lettuce, tomato, onions, pickles picking up the secondary flavors to lighten the beefiness; and ooey gooey American cheese to bring about the comfort in comfort food. But now, the bun plays a part other than holding the burger together and providing a grip to hold onto it. The bun has the slight smell and taste of A1 steak sauce; an earthy, vinegary, and Worcestershire saucy flavor. This A1 flavor gets overshadowed by the charbroiled Whopper beef patty and doesn't make much impact on the burger (-1 star). As a result, you get a Whopper with black-colored buns with a slight tinge of A1. However, A1 steak sauce is a good idea, especially if you add more of it so that it is detectable in the burger. 
My charbroiled beef patty seemed to be cold and old since the burger was lukewarm at best and had cooked, congealed blood on the patty (-1 star). I understand fast food is supposed to be fast, but it should not affect the taste and presentation of the product. Congealed blood on a beef patty is a huge dealbreaker. 

The Verdict: THE HA1LOWEEN WHOPPER aka Black Buns Whopper.
Overall, bluntly, it tastes just like a whopper with a slight taste of A1 steak sauce, but with black-colored buns. Definitely an experience that Whopper lovers would enjoy since it offers a new take on the Whopper. You discover that A1 steak sauce would really complete a Whopper. However, my Whopper beef patty was cold, old, and was crusted in congealed blood. Make sure the workers make a fresh patty for you. Otherwise, some people will like this promotion and others will dismiss this as a black-bun Whopper. Your call.","10/1/2015",0
"Burger King","I just got back from the drive thru and I ordered 1 whopper and the sourdough burger combo with the chicken sticks combo. I got everything but my sourdough burger.

Staff have so-so  yeah I made it in today and that doesn't mean I want to be here preparing your food attitudes. Manager is really nice when she is at the window.

 I've started making attempts to get up early so I can avoid stopping here in the morning for breakfast.","7/6/2013",1
"Burger King","I have lost count of the number of bad experiences at this location. Today was the last straw. I ordered an egg & cheese biscuit.

"Burger King","I ordered a whopper jr meal and was able to substitute almost the entire meal except for the sandwich!

"Burger King","Recently, my family and I were visiting Dallas and stopped at this location. Upon entering, we saw a homeless, elderly man trying to order food. Every single employee that I saw completely ignored him. When the employees saw us, a young girl approached the counter, and the homeless man attempted to place his order. The young girl said she couldn't serve him, and when he asked why, she simply said I don't know, but I'm not serving you. The manager then came around the counter and asked the man to leave. While we were placing our order, the man came back in and asked my boyfriend to order him some food, and then handed him $2. We ordered food for him, the employee handed it to him and we have him his money back. He quietly sat down to eat his food. While we were eating, we noticed two other homeless men watching tv. A few minutes after we received our food, a Dallas police van pulled up in the parking lot. The officers came inside, spoke to the manager, then went to talk to the man who we purchased food for. The manager had the nerve to point me, my boyfriend, and our 6 year old son to the police to inform him that we had bought the food. So within 20 minutes of arriving, we now had to have a conversation with Dallas Police Department over feeding the homeless, as if that's a horrible thing to do. As we drove away, the police were arresting the man. Now here's my issue with this... First he was a PAYING customer, with money in hand. I realize that he might not be the ideal customer, but I don't believe a company gets to be picky, especially when you have a dollar menu, (and for this location, it's in the ghetto!) To refuse service to a hungry customer based on his appearance is wrong. It's inhuman to deny someone to purchase anything when others are served immediately. Second of all, if this man has had previous issues at this location, if he was perceived as a danger or harmful, why did my family, including a young child, become involved in this situation? Burger King should be better equipped to handle things like this, without sacrificing other guests. And finally, the fact that the manager pointed us (literally pointed) out to the police, was not only unprofessional, but immature. It seems as though she was more mad that the man got a cheeseburger, rather thank being upset at her poor leader and management skills. As I told the police officer, when I am given the opportunity to help a fellow person, I will take it. Unfortunately, this location demonstrated the exact thing not to do when faced with a less than ideal situation.","2/10/2015",0
"Five Guys","Good spot for a quick bite. 
One of the cheaper spots for eats. 
If looking for a meatless meal they offer a veggie sandwich.","1/19/2021",4
"Five Guys","How they still stay in business is beyond me.
The burgers have this nasty aftertaste. They are so small and at 10.99 for one burger is a steep price. The cheese they use is probably the cheapest on the market. It literally turns this plastic look within 20 seconds. 

3 burgers , 2 small fries. 4 drinks  $60 

No thanks","11/6/2022",0
"Five Guys","This location seems to have declined. The fries were hard and cold, and the burger patty was a burnt hockey puck. Hoping it was a one time thing, I'll be sad if I have to trek to Plano for a burger fix :(","6/27/2022",0
"Five Guys","Not that great at thud location . Meat wasn't up to quality with a smell to it. I'm sure it wasn't fresh. Services was ok and table wasn't kept up with the cleaning.","8/17/2021",0
"Five Guys","I am very sad to see this location decline as much as it has in the past few months. We order from her through door dash and the last three orders have all been messed up badly. The burgers have the wrong toppings and even missing a burger. One of the things I love about five guys is the fries and how they make it special by putting the cup and the free scoop of fries in the bag. It's been a nice treat to make the customer feel valued. In the last three orders, we don't get the scoop and it's only 3/4 of a cup and not even a full order. Hopefully they can turn it around soon.","6/27/2022",0
"Five Guys","We must have just arrived when they had there rush hour because tables are dirty and did see a girl sweeping. Still a small line but the wait was long. I'm only knocking off one star do to how slow the service was. The food was delish and fresh was going to take a picture but we got right to eating lol super hungry. Too many shake spills in the floor and not so busy for someone to come clean it up. There is 4 people only so that can be the reason. Over all would still order from here. Just needs to be more clean. And faster service.","4/17/2021",0
"Five Guys","My family and I went here today and I was highly impressed! The food was great, but the customer service was excellent. The 3 employees working today (3/7/22) at around 5pm were not only friendly, but they were thoughtful, timely, and organized. I don't normally leave reviews for something like this, but I had to for their sake. Great job!","3/7/2022",0

"Five Guys","To start off, I absolutely love Five Guys! Burgers, fries, everything. I've been to many locations but this one gets 3 stars solely due to cleanliness. 

The food was great but, the place itself was so filthy. Almost every table (if not every single table), was covered in ketchup and spices (or dirty napkins). The floors were covered with crumbs and peanuts, the trash was over flowing, the condiment holders were empty, and the napkins had grease all over them... Almost everything for the consumer (post ordering) was NOT taken care of...

I completely understand that this is a HIGH volume Five Guys (in the very busy Dallas Galleria) but in this instance, they should have an employee or 2 devoted to taking care of all the messes / replenishing and replacing things. I've been to other food places doing high volume and a lot of traffic and still take very good care of.","3/2/2019",1
"Five Guys","So I love Five Guys Burgers and Fries but this last visit was a true disappointment. I came here not too long ago on a Saturday night. It was about 30 minutes before they were closing. When we first came in and there was no one to greet us at the front. Everyone was in the back but it just looked like they were on a break(which is fine) but  the staff just seemed way too relaxed and had no sense of urgency. Then the register was locked up and no one knew how to re open the system and the one person that knew how to , the employees seemed overly nervous to ask. But mind you there is a line forming behind us.  We were turned off by the whole experience. I don't know if I will be ever coming back to this  particular location .","7/15/2019",3

"Five Guys","I ordered a mini burger by accident? Idk what happened, but oh well. It was still a decent size surprisingly. I added grilled onion, jalapeño, and mushroom to mine. The burger was pretty decent, nothing too special, just normal. It was good. All the add-ons are for no additional charge! I really liked that part. The place was pretty dirty, tables and chairs had food all over them. It took a min to find one that I could sit at with out cleaning myself. When it's convenient, and I am hungry, I will stop here.","6/2/2019",2
"Five Guys","Always a great burger, made the way you want it! And then add overflowing home made French fries with vinegar and an amazing peanut butter and Oreo creme milk shake and you've got the perfect American Meal!","6/30/2018",0
"Five Guys","Ordered a large fry and hamburger with pickles, lettuce, tomatoes, and mushrooms and ketchup. Well there were lots of pickles Actually too many that if I didn't remove them it would've over powered the burger. I saw one sliver of a mushroom drop out the burger, really would've preferred more. The burger itself tasted pretty good but the outside of the wrapper was very greasy. I specifically asked if the french fries were crispy and the woman at the counter said oh definitely. I don't know what her definition of crispy is but these were some of the limpest fries I've ever had, not a crisp in one of them. My husband and I actually didn't even eat them. I was glad I got the free peanuts because that's pretty much what I ate instead of the fries. The free peanuts were one of the best thing from the whole restaurant.","6/20/2017",2
"Five Guys","Apparently it is National Cheeseburger Day, so we decided to try Five Guys. We had heard good reviews from friends who compared it to In-N-Out - which we love. 
It was reminiscent of In-N-Out but Five Guys provides peanuts to snack on. Random, but my husband loved that bonus.
I'm glad we went. Anthony was friendly and fun - service with a smile!
The menu is simple. Order and eat.
We ordered cheeseburgers- what a delightful surprise to receive double the meat (double cheeseburgers masquerading as cheeseburgers).
The fries were made like my mom used to make. They served a huge serving of hot potato goodness!
The burgers are juicy. 
You can order them as wraps if you're watching your carb intake. Fresh toppings but beware they are topped with American cheese- if you're avoiding processed food.
Will we go again. Fast but delicious food!","9/18/2017",1
"Five Guys","I first discovered Five Guys on the east coast, but finally gave it a try in the Big D. I thought about giving this place 4 stars, but I went ahead and thought mmm 5 for the peanut oil. Few fast food joints are using it and they should get credit for it. By the way, feel free to crack and munch on roasted peanuts before and after ordering, as they have bins for your nutty pleasure.

I'm also giving 5 stars because I rarely eat fast food and they have officially made it on my list of fast food burgers that I can stomach. They are closely ranked behind the infamous inn-n-out. The foil wrappers are also a nice touch keeping in the warmth and cheesy goodness. Cheese paper has got nothing on cheese foil, folks!

Note that a standard sized burger has 2 patties and a Little burger has one. It was a nice surprise! 100% beef patties and fresh cut fries. We ordered Cajun fries and I wasn't impressed. Go for regular. Menu is simple and the guy who rung us up was friendly. Worth a try, even at the mall.","1/23/2016",9
"Five Guys","Was so hungry and when I saw this place I had to eat here! Ordered a double small cheeseburger and cajun fries. Had to munch on some free peanuts while waiting for my order. People who ordered after me were served before me which was kinda odd. Looked at my receipt and realized the person took my order wrong :( didn't want to complain because I was hungry. After 10 minutes, i got my order. Just removed the bacon and everything was ok. This is why I gave them 1 less star :( Friendly service!","8/12/2017",1

"Five Guys","Peanuts to shell and eat while you wait. 
Belly up and order up a burger just how you like it. They are juicy and wonderful.  I wish they had other choices of cheese besides American but, hey, we ARE in America so I'm good!  The fries are fantastic and HUGE!  The seasoned fries are even better. Just bring someone to share those fries with!  It's located on the ice rink level also. Plenty of seating. Near the escalator.","8/1/2017",0
"Five Guys","There's a BIG difference with the burger sizes. I though I was getting an average sized helping when I ordered, but what came out was a mammoth portioned (huge double mat patties), savory American classic with all the toppings I chose.

The fries were just OK. Nothing spectacular about them...but the burger, it was good.

The place seemed kinda pricey overall for what you get. But all in all. Not bad.  Nothing to really note about service, since the only point of contact was when you ordered and picked up.

They do have self-serve peanuts while your food is being prepared.","1/9/2012",1
"Five Guys","Simply put, Five Guys never disappoints. It truly is just as good every single time we go. It's in my top 5 for best burgers and their fries are the bomb too.

To add to the awesomeness, you can get a Whole30 compliant burger here because they have lettuce wraps as substitute for buns and their burgers and everything is very clean. 

I always get everything in black and most of the ingredients in red. The burger is huge and messy but so damn good and it's just an amazing 10 minutes of stuffing food into my mouth.","2/19/2017",0
"Five Guys","Ordered a gluten free cheeseburger bowl and fry, my son ordered his cheeseburger. They put them in the same bag, and managed to forget the mushrooms!!!!! I told them the bowl is wrapped I'm okay with it but the fries I can't eat so they said they'd remake them, but they brought me out another cheeseburger bowl without the cheese and without the mushrooms.....

Won't come back to this location......","2/14/2016",1
"Five Guys","It's soooooo good! Love it more than In n Out and I love that place. I just wish they didn't add peanut oil, so I could try out their fries. The burgers are fresh and juicy. Lots of options to add vegetables.. love it!","1/2/2018",1
"Five Guys","I've been in a hot dog mood lately.  Yeah, I know everyone is alllll about the burger with the new In & Out and Heart Attack Grill, but it's summer and I think about hot dogs on the grill.  Apparantly Five Guys had the same thought.

I had the Bacon Cheese Dog.  Three of my favorite words combined.  There's just no way to mess this up!  Char up a doggie, add cheese, bacon, grilled onions, relish, jalapenos, mustard, mayo and slap it all on a toasty bun and WHALLAH!  Yeah, it was good.  

Add to that the Cajun Fries and you've got a meal too big for one person.  So add a friend who wants a burger and all is right with the world.  And of course a tasted the burger.  It was very good.  The meat was well seasoned.  Can't say that about Heart Attack Grill and it was twice the price. 

This is better than fast food.  It's not the best burger I've had in my life but def in the top twenty.  I would eat hear again in a heartbeat!","6/6/2011",4
"Five Guys","Literally the freaking best. I don't know how they don't have 5 stars. The best fries. Best burgers. Store is clean. Employees are efficient","8/6/2018",0
"Five Guys","The burgers are good tasty and fresh ingredients I liked that while you wait you can get a scoop of peanuts to munch on while waiting. The burgers are just good hand formed patties and no fillers you get to pick the toppings that you want on your burger which is really nice and they had fresh potatoes cut into freshly made fries they even had the name of the farm providing the potatoes for the fries at the time. All good the fries were a bit oily and not as crispy as I prefer but good tasting. 

Being in the mall and parking in the mall is pretty bad you are better off going to one of their other locations unless you are in the mall. It can get quite crowded since it is in the mall but there are quite a bit of seats so it seems it fills up but turns over pretty quickly.","2/20/2012",2
"Five Guys","What's with the peanuts?  Help yourself to as many as you want.

Burgers - Large, messy and gooey.  The regular burger has 2 patties and they allow you to get as many different toppings as you want.  You can even say everything.
Cajun Fries - Nice flavor and plenty of Cajun spice.  The fries were served in a cup and spilled over into the bag.  A regular order was more than enough for two people.  I'm not sure how many potatoes went into making my one order of fries, but it seemed like a lot.

Overall a good burger, but I wouldn't say it's the best in town or anything.  I'd eat here again, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here and fight the Galleria crowd.","9/15/2010",2
"Five Guys","This location is in the bottom of the galleria beside the ice skating ring!

This is fast food, it's greasy and bad for you and a little messy, but it's done better than other chains. They hand cut their potatoes and you can even see on the wall where the potatoes of the day came from. Hand made patties that come with either 1 patty to a burger (little) or 2 patties to a burger if you order a regular. I advise that unless you're REALLY hungry, order the little. As someone who can really put it away when they're hungry I made the mistake of ordering the regular once and ended up over-stuffed. 

They are really generous with the portions on their fries as well, a small is closer to a large at most fast food places. The other sizes are definitely meant to be shared, which is nice if you're going to be eating with someone else because it will save you both some money. Even the regular fries are delicious, but I'm partial to the cajun fries. These they also season very well, so well in fact that sometimes you have to knock off the extra. 

At the end of the day what makes Five Guys good is that they stick to a small, simple menu and they do it well. I love it!","4/4/2015",1

"Five Guys","Very disappointed!! They were out of cheese, pickles and mustard at this location, never had that happen before. The facility was unkept, employees were not friendly and they definitely need more than 2 soft drink dispensers. Happy they still had meat and buns. With all the reviews on the wall and cups was hoping for better. Thumbs down","12/26/2017",0
"Five Guys","Burger was cooked perfectly, but the tomato was very under-ripe.  I felt cheated on the amount of fries.  I ordered the regular, not the small.  Don't be tricked into thinking that they give you a lot of fries for free.  The regular is almost $4 just for the fries.  There SHOULD be a LOT of fries for that price.  I got a decent amount, but not $4 worth.  The fries were also a little unevenly cooked.  There were quite a few that were not quite done frying.  On top of all that, a regular burger is almost $6 without cheese.  After tax (and with just tap water to drink), my bill was almost $11.  Last thing... this is a self-policing fast food dining room with self serve drinks.  Get the damn tip jar off of the counter.","4/17/2014",9
"Five Guys","Great burger joint (for this level). I stopped by and ordered the small burger with all the toppings and small fries. What can I say? It was great just what a good(old fashioned) burger should be hot seasoned beef patty on a fresh bun that's been toasted with fries. If there's one thing that I didn't care for was the fact that even though the small fry was huge soo many of the fries were really dark like they were made with the bad part of an old potato. You know, the part that should really be thrown away. Also, I had to clean off my own table before sitting down. In their defense this place is in the mall and as such can get kinda busy with people coming and going and I did see an employee come out and start clearing off tables. All in all a good overall burger place and certainly better than the drive through places.","4/22/2017",0
"Five Guys","I am obsessed with this place. I love it!
Straight up cheese burger with sauteed onions and mushrooms it's delicious. Love how the oil just oozes between my fingers and on the tin foil. 
I also like how the fries are HUGE and can feed like 4 people!
AND, they have cherry coke!! I only get it when it's out as a treat for myself and I like to mix it with Diet Coke.
Love me some Five Guys right about now ;)","4/14/2012",0
"Five Guys","Fresh made food. No frozen patties or fries. All fresh made to order. 
Burger had good flavor. Plenty big enough to feed even the hungriest of people.

Also while you wait for your fresh food they have peanuts you can munch on.
Overall great experience.","9/4/2012",0

"Five Guys","I've eaten at the Five Guys in Odessa, TX lots of times.  I always went there when I craved a good burger. It silenced my craving for meat because most of the places to eat in Odessa are REALLY bad, There's an oil boom there & no matter where one goes to eat - there's a crowd.  It's not really an incentive for the restaurant owner to serve good food.

Dallas has some great places to eat!  So, comparatively speaking, Five Guys is only an Okay place to eat.  They DID cook our food much more quickly than the Five Guys in Odessa.  That was nice.  I was with family & the music was too loud to carry on a conversation.  

I will go back there again because the Fam liked it a lot. Two of us had Hot Dogs. (I know - right?)  And, two of us had Hamburgers.  There were not any complaints.  The French Fries were VERY good.

Note to my peeps: This Five Guys is on the basement level of the Mall (where the Ice Skating rink is).  We didn't know this and wandered all over the four levels of the Mall - looking for our meat.  Finally, my Significant Other had the presence of mind to ask someone where it was.  Lol.  I think that my brain was so starved of nutrition that I couldn't think.","5/17/2014",0

"Five Guys","Another joint that aspires to the In-N-Out Burger Crown but falls way short. Have to walk through the Galleria and listen to the whiny screaming spawn of the rich to get there may make you lose your appetite as well.

However, with the decline of Mooyah, those of you entrenched in that fan club may want to consider this place. My understanding is that Five Guys is an established East Coast chain and the obvious source from which Mooyah lifted its decor. Additionally, the Guys' menu operates the exact same way as Mooyah but the product is a burger far juicier and flavorful that Moo-nah (not a typo).

I enjoyed the regular burger (two patties) but by the time I added cheese fries and a drink, it was over $10. If I am going to fork over cash like that, I might as well sample the nirvana that is Kenny's burgers. Decent food if you are stuck in this mall but don't go out of your way. 

Oh yeah, they have free peanuts. You'll need them because the avg burger takes 7 min to make and the lunchtime line will be even longer. Of course, you can eat the nuts and pretend to be at the Ballpark to pass the time. Be sure to twist your neck violently, however, to simulate all of the home runs off Rangers pitching","9/7/2008",7
"Five Guys","I originally told Bernadette we could go to Sweet Tomatoes since I had a bday coupon, but I went with Wendy and Preston instead and told her I wanted a BURGER today!
I decided we should check this place out since it was the halfway point from Garland and Lewisville.
Anyway, Five Guys. 
Atmosphere: Clean and bright. First day of setting up the Galleria Christmas tree--BONUS!!
Ordering: Easy peasy. Menu is simple and you can add toppings for free Now I know when you see Free you wanna jump up and down, but really it's not that special. It's pretty much burger basics, plus bell peppers, sauteed (called fried on the menu) onions, re-sauteed canned mushrooms, and A1 sauce. But overall the price is ok.
I ordered mushrooms, onions, mustard, and bbq sauce.
The sesame bun was soft and didn't get too soggy. The meat was juicy and thick, but flavorless. I couldn't taste the bbq sauce, but the mustard was sufficient. Onions were whatever and mushrooms bleh.
My friend and I shared the regular size cajun fries at the employees suggestion, which were good, the perfect amount to share.

I probably won't be back..sorry guys!","11/10/2008",9
"Five Guys","You see, burgers have different classes.  For instance, a fast food burger may fall into Class A, burgers like Fuddruckers and casual restaurant burgers fall into Class B, and gourmet burgers would be a Class C.  The weird thing about this burger is that its a Class A.5 as it falls right in between Class A and Class B, but it sure tastes pretty damn good!

Its like a typical burger from the cartoons.  Its mashed together tightly, melted cheese serving as glue for the patties and buns, wrapped in aluminum foil to maintain temperature and served with some kick ass fries.

The main downside to Five Guys, however, is the absence of shakes.  What a let down, man.  They're that short of a perfect meal and five stars.  But no doubt, this is the best burger of its Class.","11/5/2009",7
"Five Guys","Oh wow, this place has fallen in ratings fast!  Well..  I'm not gonna tell you this place is BAD.  It's.. not all bad.  What it is, though, is a bit overrated.  And it makes me wonder what everyone else in the nation sees about this place.  Five Guys has finally come to Dallas and it's a welcome addition to this city's already long list of burger joints.  Now, granted, the last burger I had was the $60 Rossini burger at the Burger Bar in Vegas.  So this review - and any other future burger reviews - may be quite biased.  

I had seen this place several times at my favorite shopping mall, but had passed on it every time.  I had heard mixed reviews, but one day was finally compelled to find out for myself.  Well, I was a little disappointed.  The menu is incredibly short and you only have a choice between a hamburger or a cheeseburger.  You can add bacon for a cost.  Toppings are free, which sounds cool, but it's really just basics.  You can get some sauteed mushrooms and grilled onions, though.  The fries are available in regular or large and for one person, a regular is more than enough.  I spent $10 on a regular burger, regular fries and a regular drink.  Pricey since the burger was probably on par with.. Burger King?  Actaully, no, it wasn't as tasty as the King's flame-broiled goodness.  First of all, it doesn't look appetizing.  They wrap the burger up for you and when you unwrap it, it looks like a sweaty ball of a burger.  Check out my picture for reference.  The fries were the highlight of the meal, although they aren't the best either.  I got the regular fries instead of the cajun ones 'cause, well, ew.   So... come here if you want a snack or just want to munch on some fries.  

The service is like any other fast food joint and the atmosphere is about the same.  There are free peanuts to eat while you wait in line, although, they aren't enough to make me become a regular.","11/20/2008",7
"Five Guys","I checked out Five guys at lunch today - gotta love a parking garage on the rainy days, right? Anyway - I had never been so I got a cheeseburger with mushrooms and my normal toppings a regular order of cajun fries, and a large drink. 

The staff was really really nice (a manager even came by to see how my food was later!) and the place is REALLY clean. You can watch people busting a$$ on the rink while you wait for them to call your number.

Warning. Do not order the amount of food I did unless you have a friend with you to share. I ate my ridiculously big burger (2 patties?!!? and not those skinny ones either!) and was only able to have about 10 french fries - which was a shame because they were pretty tasty. 

Next time I'll get the little burger with one patty and bring a friend to share my fries with!

It's no Kenny's but for a fast foodish mall hamburger joint it was pretty dang good in my opinion. Definetely kicks Mooyah's butt.","6/11/2009",5
"Five Guys","Some might call five guys all in one place a sausage fest, but, after dropping by this place a couple of times, I propose to change the euphemism to a hand-formed patty fest, or possibly, add all the toppings you want and try the cajun spiced fries for Hastur's sake fest. Rolls off the tongue, no?

First off, let me echo some of the previous sentiments in stating that the portions are very large, and one burger and a regular order of fries is enough to share unless you're dragged-in-from-the-desert hungry. I'm serious here. If you're scared, throw another patty on the burger and remove all doubt. Done this way, two people can eat their fill for under $8. 

Order your burger, and the toppings are free. I don't think this is amazing amazing, as the selection is rather limited, but it is a nice benefit as most burger joints charge you for jalapenos, grilled onions, and mushrooms. 

The patties are hand-formed and grilled when you order 'em, and there are complimentary roasted peanuts literally every way you turn (and somehow already in your pockets, apartment, and dog's food bowl) to soften the wait. Baseball just lost one of the few reasons I had to attend a game.

My burger came out hot, juicy, and well seasoned, and even through the jalapenos were thick-cut and fresh (not pickled), they weren't blindingly hot. This is a very serviceable burger. 

The fries really steal the show here, though they approach the art from the tender, skin-on approach rather than the crispy, classic approach. 
I get my fries with the cajun seasoning, which probably has enough MSG to stagger a field of mice, but which is also truly fantastic. 

The reason a regular order of fries is sufficient to split is the way they serve them: they first fill a styrofoam cup with fries, place it in a large brown bag, and then top it off with another shovel of fries! I have attacked the loose fries in the bag only to get full before I reached the fries in the cup, which is pretty impressive. Befriend a heart surgeon and have him accompany you if you try to take out the large order.

Next time you pass by this place in the mall and your girl is on a dress-buying mission straight from the president himself, duck in here for a quick cajun-seasoned restorative, which I believe is how they used to cure the gout in olden days.","8/23/2009",4
"Five Guys","I am a big burger slob who will seriously try any burger I read a good review about.  I love burgers.  Big juicy sloppy burger dripping with cheese and onions and bacon and ketchup and mayo...drooooool.  I saw some bad reviews about this place when it first opened, so due to my fear of having a potentially bad burger, I've avoided it.

The husband dragged me here last week.  Kicking and screaming.  But, I was hungry and he was paying, so in we went.  It's about fricking time.  To finally have a place in the galleria that wasn't Grand Luxe (who wants to spend $50 on lunch when you're running to the mall?) or the crappy food court (Which Wich has green meat) that you can get a good burger, fries and a drink for under $10 is awesome.

The little burgers are plenty!  This is NOT In-N-Out at all in any way on earth except that they both have red and white, in which case, we can also compare In-n-Out to Yelp.  It tastes completely and totally different.  But the taste is good, so that's a plus!","10/27/2009",4
"Five Guys","Holy crap. 

Holy moly. 

Holy Hamburger. 

This place rocks. After being beaten down by a 3-4 hour trip to the mall with the GF to look at accessories at nearly every girly place in the Galleria, I was rewarded with my first trip to what ya'll call 5G. While I didn't voice my love for 5 Guys verbally, I devoured their Bacon Burger in literally 3 minutes and could have easily done it sooner if I didn't have to listen and mutter one word responses during my meal. Kobiyashi would have been impressed. 

Thick, juicy, fatty hamburger meat hits bun, with all sorts of toppings available. No add-on costs for the toppings. This was my favorite hamburger of the last 6 months- no doubt in my mind. There were so many tastes in my mouth from this burger, I don't know where to begin. The bacon was crispy and salty, the lettuce, pickles and sauteed onions all added to the burger and the meat, ohhhhhhh the meat, was cooked to my medium specified perfection. 

We shared a regular size of fries together. Those were my only drawback from a 5 star rating. Being a newbie to this place, I did not realize I could order the fries cajun style, and I was a bit disappointed that during my ordering process I wasn't informed of this choice. Damn! So I was stuck with their standard 5G style fries, which were good, but some could have been a bit more crispy. One thing I did like about the fries as well was the amount of salt used- seemed like they were seasoned just right. 

Verdict: I'm wayyyyyyy fatter if this was closer to my place, but I am so excited that this was a treat for me (I'm such a good dog), and I look forward to my next excursion to 5G!","7/6/2010",2
"Five Guys","I guess I'm the odd gal out on Five Guys. I went there for lunch today, and I thought it was awesome! I'm a huge fan of fast food cheeseburgers so I always have to try new places. I was already in the Galleria shopping so it was a convenient stop. 

I got a little cheeseburger without fries (so I can't comment on those). The meat was delicious (not too thick or thin), the cheese was perfectly melted, and the bun was toasted just right. Yum! I do agree that it's a lot like Mooyah, which I also love, but I thought Fives Guys was even better. I will definitely go back.","9/26/2008",3
"Five Guys","I ate here a while back and really enjoyed their food. The fries they have here are wonderful and extremely tasty. The burger is made to order and this is certainly no understatement. The burger had lots of flavor and the staff was really polite. I haven't been back in a while so it didn't really make me addicted to their burgers, but they are pretty good. Well worth the extra dollar when deciding on which burger joint to head to.

I took off a star because the burger was really messy. I had to finish the burger with a knife and fork because it was extremely hard to hold in my hand without going for a napkin after every other bite. Other than that, it's worth a shot if you're in the mood for some tasty fries, great service, and a flavorful (but messy) burger!","9/10/2009",2
"Five Guys","Sorry guys, I'm just not a fan of Five Guys. 

I've eaten at a few different locations in both Texas and Florida and I've never been impressed. The burgers are decent and they do allow lots of customization so that's a plus, but after that, I'm not a fan. The fries here are terrible and they have boxes of peanuts everywhere which is just odd. The peanuts are tasteless but I guess that's the point. Everything here is beyond greasy and the salt on the fries makes me feel like a slug. 

The service is usually decent but very slow. I know they emphasize the fact that their burgers are made fresh, but they take way too long. It's like they make every burger one at a time and they have no idea how to multitask. 

My biggest complaint though is the hundreds of magazine articles and Zagat reviews that cover every inch of his place. I find it just a bit narcissistic. I'm so glad you are raved about in magazines in Norfolk and Orlando but nobody around here cares. Dallas is actually a city that has great food. So I really could care less about all the out of town reviews. 

Overall, give it a try if you like but it's not going to draw me back to the basement of the Galleria.","9/30/2010",2
"Five Guys","I don't see what all the fuss is about this place. I thought it was going to be hugely amazing when I heard about it from everyone all the time.

I went there and paid like 12 bucks after tax for a burger, fries, and a drink, all of which you have to purchase separately. I didn't think the burger was good enough to justify the cost, and I didn't particularly care for the fries' seasoning.

Considering Taco Cabana is literally a stone's throw from their door, I can't see ever going there again. And if I want a burger, I can get everything I got there from Wendy's or Burger King for about a third of the price.","10/21/2010",2
"Five Guys","First time coming to this location. The burger, 5 stars for a fast food place. The fries were okay. The guy who rang us up was super friendly and made us feel welcome. They have those cool soda machines where you can get all kinds of crazy flavored beverages so that was nice. With other options in the mall, don't know that I would come back. Kind of a one and done deal for me.","3/13/2016",0
"Five Guys","I would like to start by saying I am not a burger fan.  Not by any means.  Having said that, this may be the best burger place I have been to.

I got the little bacon burger.  One patty, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, mayonaise, bacon, cheese.  Just a simple burger and it was delicious.  I usually don't want to finish my burger when I get one, but this one I could not put down.

The meat was juicy, all the flavors combined were excellent, and the fries were damned good, too.

I would definitely come here again.  This is the first 5 star rating I have given out and I don't like burgers!!!!!","11/25/2009",2
"Five Guys","Amazing. I had to try this place after all the rave reviews. The fiancee and I both had little cheeseburgers the way we wanted and shared a small order of the Cajun fries. 

First, the burgers were a good size and I imagine we wouldn't have been able to finish the regular size. However, we are small people so if you can eat a lot, the regular burgers might be better for you. The patties were well seasoned and very juicy. Made fresh and exactly how we ordered them, A+. The small order of Cajun fries was more than enough for the both of us. Actually, the dude filled up the cup and dropped another scoop in our bag; we didn't finish the fries. Btw, Cajun fries are the way to go - fresh cut fries sprinkled with Cajun seasoning. 

The workers were all very nice and there's free peanuts all over the place. We spent about $12 and left the place full and happy. Five Guys serves very quality burgers for a decent price and we'll definitely come back again.","12/22/2009",1
"Five Guys","Not a bad burger. I like the fact they get their potatoes fresh on a weekly basis. The cashier on this particular day suggested I get the Cajun fries with my meal and it did not disappoint. Overflowing cup of fries that you can actually share with someone. I almost always go big or go home when I have the option to get 2 patties over 1. 

I like their burgers but am still in the hunt for the best burger in Dallas..","2/8/2009",2
"Five Guys","The no.2 loaded is a really great burger and their frys are one of my favorite frys. The I like the brown bags it's served in reminds me of a old diner.","12/12/2015",0
"Five Guys","I must be crazy too, because I think this may have been the best burger I've ever had.

The place is definitely a basic burger joint with a a small menu. I've been to Mooyah before and they've definitely tried to imitate what Five Guys is doing in terms of atmosphere, menu, and recipes. But as hard as Mooyah tries, Five Guys is far superior.

I had a bacon cheeseburger and fries and again, it was absolutely amazing. A soft homemade bun, two thick beef patties that were handmade as opposed to the thin pre-made patties at most places. Fresh veggies and melty cheddar cheese and delicious bacon. This is hands-down the best burger I've ever eaten (and I've eaten a lot of burgers in my time).

The fries were practically perfect too. Fresh, handcut potatoes are used to make their fries and the flavor is amazing.

I honestly can't think of another time where I have consciously been amazed by the food I was eating. I cannot wait to go again.","10/10/2008",2
"Five Guys","DELICIOUS hamburgers! They are so juicy, fresh and customized with all the ingredients you want that makes it very different from other fast food chains. Now I understand the growth of this chain. The potato fries are also from real potatoes and you can easily notice that.","11/2/2011",2
"Five Guys","Despite the mixed reviews, I think the burgers here are decent.  The menu is simple...they have burgers with one or two patties, grilled cheese sandwich, and hot dogs.  No chicken, turkey, soy, black bean patties.  

They have a ton of extras ranging from grilled mushrooms and onions to an assortment of peppers that you can add to your burger for absolutely free.  I think the one thing that I really like about this place is the bread.  The bread is really soft and tastes fresh.  

This is a good place to stop for lunch at the Galleria without breaking your budget.","2/11/2009",2
"Five Guys","It might just be that I am a skeptic, but any place that plasters its walls with reviews of how good it is sets off my bull alarms. I mean, if a place is good, it should sell itself.
I had a regular cheeseburger with Cajun fries. The burger was so greasy we needed a ton of napkins, and to me, the flavor wasn't there. I also was not all that impressed with the fries. Added to this, the price is kinda high. Sorry to rain on your parade, but I am not impressed.","2/8/2009",2
"Five Guys","I went back again and tried their cajun fries, they are really good! I forgot to add that unless you have a REALLY big apatite, trust me the single patty hamburger is more than enough.","6/26/2009",1
"Five Guys","Another good meal at 5G today. Cajun fries were right on in terms of doneness and texture; grease level was at a minimum. The burger was fantastic, very juicy without being super greasy. I'm still a big fan!","1/14/2010",1
"Five Guys","Saw this in Galleria and finally stopped in.  The normal burgers are 2 patties and the little burgers are 1.  I got the normal but would have been fine with the little one.

Choices of toppings & sauces were expansive for a little shop.  I agree with the In-And-Out comparison mostly bc of the feel of the joint and limited menu.  Maybe there's a secret Animal Style or Extra Toast to be discovered.  Or maybe they'll look at me like I'm crazy and say no soup for you.","10/14/2009",1
"Five Guys","For the past few years, I've been working in second-tier cities in China - where a good burger is hard to come by. Visiting the Galleria, I *had* to stop in to the Five Guys and try their stuff out.

Good things:

-  I hadn't really heard of Five Guys before, so I was very, very, very pleasantly surprised with the quality of the food.

-  The girl at the counter was patient while I figured out the menu, and helped explain items to me.

-  I ended up ordering a cheeseburger with everything and some fries - super filling, super fresh. I'd go again in a heartbeat.

-  My order came in reasonably fast, and even though we were there at kind of a down time (4:00 PM on a Tuesday or Wednesday afternoon), the staff seemed to be attending to orders super diligently. No one was just standing around. I like things like that.

Bad things:

I can't really justify eating here every day. Honestly, that's about it. I enjoyed my burger, and that's all that really matters at a burger place, right?","7/30/2012",1
"Five Guys","Five guys consistently delivers a big, greasy, cheesy, delicious burger that is sure to please anyone seeking something greater than drive thru trash.

A mountain of fries is served regardless of the size you order and they're good too.  Try cajun style for a little extra spice.

In shell peanuts while you wait.

It really doesn't get much better than this for a fast food burger.

A con would definitely be the price.  A bacon cheeseburger and drink will run you $10.  Add fries and you're up to 12+.

This particular location is a little difficult to get to as it is located inside the Galleria and on the bottom floor.  I always feel strange when I get a to-go order and walk through Macy's with a big greasy bag of food that smells terrible when mixed with the crappy perfume being sprayed non-stop.","5/30/2011",1
"Five Guys","Delicious burgers and those spicy fries are great. I order from Doordash. Thanks!","3/8/2018",0
"Five Guys","I'm pleasantly suprised. Less than $10 for a double cheeseburger (masquerading aroud as a regular cheeseburger), a regular fries that could feed two and a large drink. And it was good too. The meat is the star here. It wasn't overly salty like Ball's or Winfield's (two of my favorite burger joints) can be, nor was it masking lack-luster beef flavor through the clever use of onion powder, garlic, ranch dressing, eggs, etc., etc.,

The simple menu and lack of picture-perfect presentation makes this place feel like it's indepentently owned and operated, even though it's part of a huge chain.","5/24/2011",0
"Five Guys","When I want a burger this is where I go! Love Five Guys and I have consistently gotten great service at this location and now that they finally have the milkshakes, I can give them 5 stars. Salted caramel milkshake is so addictive! I love the fresh cut fries however the Cajun seasoning isn't anything special which it's great you don't get charged extra for it. So I do recommend to check the Cajun fries out just because and you can be your own judge of what you think but I'll stick to the regular.","7/12/2016",2
"Five Guys","A step up from Mooyahs. The taste of their burgers are a step above in my opinion. Giant overstuffed burgers oozing with cheese. Terribly unhealthy but not what they are aiming for lol.","5/2/2014",2
"Five Guys","This is a juicy (read greasy) hamburger...but it isn't pretending to be anything else.  The meat is well seasoned, the toppings choices included grilled onions, grilled mushrooms and jalapenos for free, and the french fries are awesome (don't forget to ask for the cajun seasoning on the fries).  Don't expect a gourmet burger here, but you can be confident you are going to get a top notch example of the classic variety!","10/21/2010",0
"Five Guys","Oh how I love 5 guys burgers!!!

My favorite burger is the double cheese with A1, sauteed onions and mushrooms... So freaking good.  Their meat is always cooked correctly and is always juicy. Topping are great,fresh and in good supply. One big tip is always go there in pairs.. they give enough fries for 2-3 people in a single order and 4-5 in a large. 

Cajun seasoning is pretty good for the fries but get it on the side so you can put the right amount for you on them. The fries are usually slightly overcooked which seems to be their style, so I have gotten used to it. I would easily give 5 stars if they had sweet potatoe fries or the fries were cooked a little better. 

Still my favorite burger place nationwide and will be until something just flat out blows me away the way 5 guys did day one and has continued to do so. 

Sincerely,

"Five Guys","Inexpensive, delicious, and simple. Perfect! A direct comparison to In-N-Out but they are even in my book for different reasons. 

Five Guys: pattys are superior and have a hand made look/feel

Final Score: even

Although, I wish that both of them would serve a chicken option too! However that would never happen :(","4/27/2009",0
"Five Guys","Being from Northern Maine, I don't get to go to places like this very often.  I almost got to eat at one a few months ago at Regan National, but I would have missed my flight.  I'm glad I went out of my way tonight in Dallas to eat here.

So, you go to the grocery store and buy ground beef, seeded burger buns, American cheese, white onion, bacon, and potatoes and then go right home.  When you get there, you hand-form the beef into patties and throw them on the griddle.  You cook up the bacon nice and crispy and chop up the onions while you grill the buns to the texture of a good grilled cheese.  Then you cut the potatoes into fries and throw them into peanut oil to fry them.  Burger is done, you put it together with ketchup and mustard and throw a bit of salt on the fries.  Lots, and lots of fries.

This is exactly what you will get if you go to Five Guys Burgers & Fries.  It tastes exactly the same, except you didn't have to go shopping or clean up the mess!  The burger I had, a double bacon with onion, ketchup, and mustard, tasted exactly like I would make at home.  No pre-processed frozen burger patties here!  It was delicious and there is no way anyone could eat all the fries they give you.

Comments specific to this location would be that the guy cooking the burgers and the girl at the register were incredibly friendly and had real, genuine smiles on their faces.  The guy who came to ask me how it was when I was done seemed like he really cared to know the answer I gave him.  This won't be my last Five Guys burger, and if you haven't had one yet, you should!","3/22/2012",0

I like this place..
the fries are rad,the burgers are good.. just was better in DC..VA.. everywhere else...

"Five Guys","It's nice to get free peanuts when you arrive. It gives u something to do while waiting on your food. It's also nice to sit and watch the ice skaters nearby. The food is good and cooked fresh. Fresh cut fries. Kids like the soda machine.","8/1/2014",0
"Five Guys","Having a penchant for Burgers, I have long awaited the arrival of Five Guys to Dallas. I first got introduced to Five Guys 5-6 years ago during a trip to the DC area. At the time Five Guys was just 5 stores - a family owned concept started in the DC/MD/VA area that did what they knew best - Burgers and Fries. I considered this one of the best burgers I have had at a fast food joint. So, it became a must-visit destination on almost every visit to DC. When I heard that they are franchising and finally opening in Dallas I was over the moon. So I awaited their opening and finally visited their first store in the Galleria. 

One word: Disappointment !!!
One could say my expectations were too high but nah !! I was in DC 2 weeks ago and visited the very first store that ever opened - completely different experience. So, I thought....maybe I'll give it a couple of days and visit the Galleria store again.
One more word: Dejection !!!

Pros:
- They are finally in Dallas....and it's nice to see the growth of a home grown, family fast food brand that could rival McD's or BK some day.
- The joint has some character and is highly rated in the DC area.

Cons:
- Burger patty was dry and overcooked
- Fries were tasteless and wilted. The same fries that are legendary in DC. I honestly felt that the large fries at $4.09 --- while were very generous in portion --- were a complete waste of money. 
- Limited menu --- which used to mean they specialize and serve what they do best....but I really don't think my wife would ever accompany me to this place to have a burger again. She hated it !!

Bottom line: A very disappointing experience having waited all these years and having tried the real deal (in DC). I might give it one more try in a couple of months...so hope they improve.","7/6/2008",6
"Five Guys","Not slap your momma good, but pretty good. Good pick for a quick burger. Burger and large drink cost me 7.67 but they will make it how you like.","10/27/2013",1
"Five Guys","The is a very decent burger.  You can tell the beef is ground fresh.  Greasier (is this a word?) than Mooyah and not as good as In-N-Out but very decent.  I didn't like the french fries personally but I can see some people liking them.  They were definitely hand cut, but for me they lacked on flavor.  I liked the toppings, fresh jalapenos are good on burgers.  I will say this I wouldn't drive and find parking in the Galleria to go there.  If I was in the mall and wanted a burger I'd go there.","12/3/2008",4
"Five Guys","Plan on doing nothing else after eating their burger and fries. Every time i feel like eating a good sized fresh burger and fresh cut fries that are not frozen, i head to five guys. While eating the burgers, you can munch on some free peanuts too. If you are allergic to peanuts, i would highly suggest you stay away from this place since they also use peanut oil to deep fry the potatoes. I have been eating burgers here for quite a long time but obviously not oftenly because i try to stay away from red meats and fried foods.","8/12/2013",1
"Five Guys","I originally found Five Guys in D.C. and loved it!

Their burgers are huge and very delicious. If you are a burger person you will love this place.

Their menu is very simple, since their motto is they only make what they can make best. 

Their burgers include a double or single patty cheeseburger and a double or single patty regular burger. They also have regular and kosher hot dogs which are to DIE for. I find it hard to decide which to get when I go!

I have to say that the actual MEAT is WAY better in TX compared to Maryland. You can't beat TX beef.

Texans, at least at this particular location, are missing out on another best part about this place. In MD when you order a regular fry they put a cup in the bottom of a bag and then DUMP a ridiculous amount of fries in. This happened at every location I visited in MD and VA, since MD is where the chain originated. 

At this location, however, they only filled the cup up and that was it. The fries were in the same bag as the burgers, which NEVER happened in MD. 

Still a lot of food for the price, and still delicious, but a little harder to share a regular fry between 3-4 people like you can in MD.

All the toppings for your burger are free so pile high or keep it simple it's up to you!","8/18/2009",3
"Five Guys","5 Guys Burgers & Fries is by far my favorite burger place! The fries are delicious & the burgers are sooo good! I love to eat here! Everything is so natural and fresh and juicy!!","8/5/2016",0
"Five Guys","I had heard so much about Five Guys, but was a little disappointed...

We ordered two little Cheeseburgers and 1 hot dog.  Let me just say that it's a good thing they have free peanuts while you wait, because the wait is LONG.  There were two orders in front of us and it took about 20 minutes to spit up our order.  On the plus side, our orders were correct considering the free topping selection they have available.

The burgers were decent.  Much more comparable to In & Out Burgers than McDonalds.  They tasted fresh...but the fries are super delicious.  They are fresh and crispy and fried in peanut oil.  They also give you great portions.

My husband thought the hot dog was the highlight...it is grilled to perfection on a toasted bun.  Very savory.

I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, but if I were at the Galleria, I may stop in if I have 20 minutes + to wait for a burger.","8/25/2008",3
"Five Guys","This place was amazing! My husband told me that he went there with his friend and they really liked it, but i didn't think it would be this great. I just thought he's a guy so of course he loves burgers pretty much anywhere. He took me there one day and when i opened the wrapper i thought the burger looked a little soggy. I took a bite and i couldn't believe it. It wasn't soggy after all, just slightly steamed which somehow made it even better. Normally, i'm not much of a burger fan but i could eat Five Guys Burgers till my heart explodes. It was delicious! 
The fries really surprised me as well. They had a comforting taste while still tasting lighter and definitely fresher than other french fries. They use a much better oil. When i saw the fries in my bag, i felt like i won the FRENCH FRY LOTTERY! The whole bag was full of them and sitting on top was my yummy, cheesy burger. 
Their burger is like eating home cooked burgers. The meat was so fresh that there's just no way to compare it to nasty fastfood burgers. The place had a cute diner / fast food restaurant atmosphere and the staff was prefectly friendly. 
I can't wait to go there again.","12/3/2009",2
"Five Guys","If you want a fatass burger and very compacted then come here. I came here with my gf and she warned me that their normal burgers come with two meat patties, but I didn't think anything of it. I had the Bacon Cheeseburger All the Way. I guess that's what made my burger so fat that I could barely fit my mouth around it to take a bite.(twss) Seriously, it was tightly packed with foil and the juices/grease soaked the bun I forgot that I was eating any bread. Luckily, I went during a weekday evening so there weren't too many people around to see the juices dripping from my face. I think next time I might wimp out and get the single patty burgers, it might be neater eating.","4/26/2011",2
"Five Guys","Another yeppy designer burger place.The burger is only 1/4 pound burger for the price of 2 pounds of prime ground round. Its nice clean and new.The reason for this review is the wendy fries.Nothing they can do about it just there business model. I will not go back...","3/2/2014",0
"Five Guys","I really like this place because the burgers are real juicy. Plus when you order fries, they give it to you in a medium sized cup and a lot in your paper bag.","10/29/2013",0
"Five Guys","i don't understand the hype with 5 guys.. in and out blows this place away

i came here for lunch recently.. and got a burger and fries and a drink.. the burger meat was flavorless.. the fries needed salt.. and it's too pricy for fast food... you can get a better burger at a ton of places here in dallas.. maple and motor ftw!","2/12/2011",1
"Five Guys","Ate there today for the first time.  Not bad, pretty quick service, was there on off hours though.  Two big negatives for me:

- One cheeseburger, one order of fries, one Coke - 12 bucks.  Crazy overpriced.  For 12 bucks it better be the best burger on the planet.

 - The bun fell completely apart about half way through the burger.  Need a more substantial bun if you're going to make a big azz burger with lots of stuff on it.  Turned into like a sloppy joe burger, could have used a knife and fork.

On the plus side:

- Burger is very good, very meaty (double patty), quite filling.  No extra charge for any of the toppings, very nice. 

- Fries are killer, they come out smokin' hot, and you get a ton of them, overflowing out of the container.

Had a nice meal but probably won't go back, a little too pricey for me for a quick burger lunch.","11/28/2012",1
"Five Guys","Went to the mall and asked around the where I should eat since this was my first trip to Dallas and this mall. Everyone said...First time here go to Five Guys. I really wasnt in the mood for a burger, but it was the place everyone pointed me to.

The burger was the best I have ever had (Taylors Refershers in St Helena, CA and SF,CA is second best). The endless condiments you can add to your burgers can make you go crazy as to flavors you want yor tongue to absorb. Also, get the cajun fries. A small size is more than enough for 2. But I couldnt share them. They were too good. The sweet tea is good there too, although im not an expert on sweet tea. I was in town for 3 days there and I came back her a second time on my trip.","5/1/2009",1
"Five Guys","Five Guys is pretty good.  It's a little pricey for a burger joint and the food portion is just too much.  Service is great, and the food is served quickly.  Just knocking it a star for price and portion.  I do prefer In N Out, but I'm a SoCal boy, so what do you expect.","8/20/2012",1
"Five Guys","Great burgers!  Made just the way I want it. Made from scratch.   Great fries!  Awesome Customer Service!    Highly recommend.","7/15/2013",0
"Five Guys","Warning: huge portions, do not go here alone.  The burgers and fries are really good and the staff is always friendly.  The prices are a bit high, but if you are sharing fries, not a big deal.  Feel free to take some peanuts back to the office for an afternoon snack.","7/26/2009",0
"Five Guys","Been there twice and it was consistent. Awful. The patties have no flavor and are an unappetizing dark color. They are reminiscent of McDonald's . The fries are greasy and limp. Yes, it is cheap and may be fresh but who cares? For another three dollars you get a better product at Liberty. For an additional two dollars you can have one of the best burgers in Dallas at Becks. 

Wish it were better as there are a lot of topping options but this is just bad.","9/17/2013",0
"Five Guys","Seems like it's always hit or miss with this place. One day great food the other day, not so much. Last time I was there my fries were hot and tasty but the burger was not good, how can this happen? The burger I ate this day had almost no seasoning like they completely forgot to add salt. I will try them again but it may be six months as they have a lot of competition which I feel are better establishments.","10/24/2013",0
"Five Guys","By far the best fast food burgers in town. Juicy beef and freshly made frys. And free peanuts! How can you not love this place?","5/26/2013",0
"Five Guys","Living in California, it is a treat to have Five Guys when I can. The only other places I've had it is in D.C./Maryland and North Carolina.  It is downstairs in the mall and service was very friendly.  I had a little cheeseburger and it was good, although not as sumptuous as I remembered from before. It also could have been because I got distracted in the mall and waited awhile before eating the burger.","6/23/2010",0
"Five Guys","I was craving something greasy after spending 10 hours at work and the fact that in 72 hours, I will be doing the Rebel Race. The mood I was sinking into was for me to sink my teeth into oil, cheese, meat and salt. My craving led me to FGB&F. I ordered the regular size burger and I forgot the little burgers are big enough. Also, you can actually share the small size fries. The cashier that took my order was very friendly and actually had a small conversation with me. The fries were great and well seasoned.  They still had some potato skins on them. sigh! Greasy Success!  The burgers were good and the price was decent. I was pretty full after eating only half.","8/16/2012",0
"Five Guys","Tasty! On my burger scale, it wasn't as good as Shake Shack in NYC, but it's close. I wanted to try this place when I was in NYC, but I didn't have the time to try two burger places (boo!), so I'm glad I was able to go here in Dallas. This place reminds me of In-and-Out for some reason.","9/28/2009",0
"Five Guys","Horrible, Horrible, the horror.  Water and grease apparantly do mix as proven by the paper thin grease soaked patties that have you craving for a cup of astringent.  Why do people get lazy and grill paper thin patties.  A burger should be a thick slab of quality beef that you can sink your teeth into, not get a paper cut on your lip.  Plus you can end up saving the environment on using less napkins.","11/19/2010",0
"Five Guys","Good burger for a FAST FOOD place!  Single meat is the little burger & double meat is the regular burger. The fries are what I really like!   Beware, they give a lot so be sure to share!  Peanuts while you wait!  Yum!","12/19/2011",0
"Five Guys","This place is a bit over-rated. Not to say their burger was disgusting. It was just okayish. I think Burger Street is much better and not as greasy.","12/2/2010",0
"Five Guys","I literally just finished up my Five Guys meal of a made-to-order grilled cheese.  It was really the perfect size.  It looks like they grill up the hamburger buns instead of sandwich bread and you're left with a cute, round, stuffed sandwich.  I was full, but not stuffed (I hear it's the awesome fries that do you in).  The only reason I'm giving it four stars is that the jalepenos I ordered didn't add enough spice to the sandwich, but nevertheless, I will be back.","10/25/2012",0

"Five Guys","Very average burger, at best.  Kincaids is much better, as are several other local, non chain joints.  Better than a McDonalds but not much.","7/7/2011",0
"Five Guys","Five Guys has the best non-In-n-Out fast food burger in the country. It's an institution in my hometown of Washington DC that has franchised nationally in recent years. Mooyah has tried to copy their decor and burger style in DFW, but they can't pull it off like the original.","11/3/2009",0
"Five Guys","They weren't the first burger concept to bring fresh cow, dough and potatoes to a fast food table (a la In-n-Out), but they ABSOLUTELY ARE THE BEST!!!  In rank order of awesome chain FRESH burger places, these guys are number one! (In-n-Out #2, Mooyah #3).  Their burgers are consistently tasty and greasy and their fries kick the pants off of Mooyah and In-n-Out.","8/30/2011",0
"Five Guys","Love this place!! Great burgers!! Closest thing to In & Out burger in the area!!! Fries are hand cut and fresh everyday!!! If it was up to the  bf we would eat there everyday..","8/29/2010",0
"Five Guys","I don't get all of the hype. The burger was okay but not worth the price. I can make a burger at home that's just as good for a fraction of the price,

However, when I asked about the fries , I wanted to make sure that they would be cooked crisp and hot when I receive my food. I explained to the order taker that I have had a lot of bad,cold,soggy fries at other burger joints and I expect being that this place is so pricey that the fries better be perfect.

Well when the food came out guess what, the fries were piping hot , but under cooked and soggy. I then brought it to their attention and they offered to give me a new order of fries. By the time the fries came out I was done with the burger and the fries ended up being the same way, under cooked and soggy.

This was at the north Irving location on Macarther.","1/14/2013",0
"Five Guys","The hamburgers at Five Guys are some of the best tasting you will get anywhere. The fries are not my favorite, but they are OK. Free peanuts to snack on while you wait for your order are a plus.","1/12/2011",0
"Five Guys","I love their burger because they are so fresh.  Also you can design it to your own preferences.  There are alot of great toppings too.  They offer peanuts as you wait for your food.  Beware that the regular fries are enormous and can feed 2-3 people.","6/26/2012",0

"Five Guys","My mother and I went to the Galleria on Saturday, March 11. We decided to grab some lunch at Five Guys on the Ice Rink level, and let me tell you - it was FABULOUS! I have been to other Five Guys in the area many times, but this one at the Galleria takes the cake! The person who took our order was extremely friendly and fast, and while the place was very busy we had no trouble finding a seat, as the lady who was in charge of cleaning tables was fast, efficient, and helpful in showing us a table. What really made this a special visit was what happened when our food was ready. The guy who took our order personally delivered our food to us - he remembered our number and even asked if we needed some ketchup! What BRILLIANT service! We will definitely keep this Five Guys in mind next time we're craving a burger at the Galleria - way better than the McDonald's on the third level!","3/13/2012",1
"Five Guys","The vibe of the interior design is more like a hole in the wall style.  You can have as many peanuts as you like while you wait for your order.  The peanuts are roasted and good.   Cashier girl was nice.  I got the cajun fries and the worker described it as spicy, but it tasted like it was just seasoned to me.  The fries were bit crispy so it was good, cause usually fries that size tend to be soggy.  I got the little cheeseburger, which filled me up.  Little doesn't mean little, little means one patty which is still a full size burger especially with everything in it.  The burger can get messy, but it was tasty.  Not bad here.","1/13/2011",0
"Five Guys","Amazing.  Best burger period.  Forget in and out.  Forget everybody else.  And amazing fries.  Worth the trip.","10/4/2012",0
"Five Guys","Rookie took my order and got it wrong. Ordered Cajun fries, got regular fries and was handed a container of seasoning. Disappointed.","1/2/2013",0
"Five Guys","My first experience in a Five Guys Restaurant was today and I was quite impressed!  My burger was absolutely declicious.  It was made fresh once I ordered it and you can choose whatever toppings you like for no additional charge.  I'm a big eater and I like how the standard burger has two patties.  I don't know if we just got lucky but it seemed as if they made our fries to order too, they were HOT!!  They were cooked really well and as others have said they were plentiful!  I would definitely recommend splitting the small order among a couple people.  Way more than you need, but honestly it was even more than I wanted.  I opted for the cajun spice on the fries, and while it wasn't bad, I was certianly underwhelmed.  I think I could concoct a better seasoning in just a few minutes.  Another minor annyoyance was that you cannot understand what order number the guy is calling out.  It would seriously be a lot easier on everyone if he just said quarto or cinco lol. I would have rated this place a 5 star, but b/c of the lackluster cajun seasoning and the guy calling out the order numbers, it just isn't quite perfect.","10/10/2010",0
"Five Guys","Any reviewer on here who compares Five Guys to Whataburger needs to have their heads examined.  There is no comparison.  The burgers are huge, fresh and very tasty. The fries arrive at the restaurant disguised as potatoes. It doesn't get any fresher.  If you want a five dollar burger, have at it, McDonalds awaits you.  If you want quality burgers, this place has them.","9/8/2022",1
"Five Guys","Wouldn't hire the Gm kevin to run my business frugal ass  doesn't know how to treat a customer and make them happy to wanna come back to the location that screwed their entire order up. . I guess that's what happens when you hire a bunch of teenagers that don't know what they're doing and mess everybody shut up, knowing that the place is not gonna refund them after they piss them off. Not even a gift certificate to come back. Laugh my ass off go to In-N-Out Burger. It's 2/3 the cost of five guys ratchet n fries","1/6/2023",0
"Five Guys","The service was non-existent & they have the nerve to ask for a tip when you slide your card at payment. The burger and fries were good, but $19.84 for a burger and fries is ridiculous. Yes, I knew the prices before ordering; but I was looking for Jimmy John's & couldn't find it so ended up coming here in a pinch. Lesson learned.","4/5/2022",0
"Five Guys","Went to this establishment today. It's an extremely expensive place when I compare to the quality of food.
I paid almost 5 bucks for the small fries and it taste lawful,fully loaded with red pepper and salt. I threw it away . The burger was normal , nothing to boast about .
There are 5 workers at the counter with 2 customers. 
Probably will return in a year and please remove that disgusting fries.","6/16/2022",0
"Five Guys","Worst run restaurant ever. 30-45 minutes for a burger. Fry cook is the cashier. Mananger just wants to stuff bags. One lady is responsible for everything else; building burgers and cooking french fries. 30 people here just waiting on food. All of them standing around the pickup area. I'm #27 and I just heard them call #10's order. I've been waiting 30 minutes and still have 10+ orders in front of mine. Don't come here unless you run out of options.","9/29/2022",0
"Five Guys","These burgers are the best and my favorites. If they had a drive thru I would likely be by here once a week!  Take it lightly on the fries. We bought a large and has 3 servings left to take home!
I had a large burger with bacon and cheese and fixings...soo delicious!!!","5/25/2020",2
"Five Guys","Staff was rude and food was of subpar quality. Spent $44 for a McDonald's burger. Will not be coming back. Sucks too because 5 guys is usually good. Terrible location. Staff has no sense of hospitality.","1/9/2022",0
"Five Guys","Can someone tell me what's going on with the Irving location at MacArthur and Royal Ln?
I called repeatedly and they just hang up...no hello or nothing. I wanted to place an order by phone and pick it up but the website only gave a delivery option through Grub Hub or Door Dash.  It would be great if they explained their changes instead of just hanging up on me.","1/12/2021",1
"Five Guys","Five guys in Irving has very average food and the staff is rude. I'm not understanding what happened to good customer service, but it no longer exist. I don't need the rolling out of the red carpet upon entry into an establishment just a simple...Hi how can I help you! Going forward I'll take my business elsewhere.","3/5/2022",0
"Five Guys","They've obviously got very fresh ingredients, and it tastes that way. Their burgers are miles ahead of other fast food chains. Understandably, the orders take longer to make. 

I dislike how overpriced Five Guys is. I got the little bacon cheeseburger without the bun, which came out to about $9. So it's not much food for what I paid, and the taste is not amazing. I could get a fresh bunless burger for much cheaper at a certain Californian burger chain across the street.

Additonally, the lettuce wraps are very messy and hard to eat. The other aforementioned Californian burger chain makes lettuce wraps much neater with a taped paper wrapper. Five guys just folds it in foil.","8/26/2019",1
"Five Guys","Placed an order online, paid and when I went to go pick up my food, they had locked the doors and didn't even come out to see why I was standing there. Took my payment with no food in return.","2/1/2022",0
"Five Guys","My wife and I did a taste test with Five Guys, In and Out and Whataburger. I was trying to buy a hamburger and fries at each. Whataburger it was around $5.50. In and Out with the double was around $5.50. Five Guys' most basic burger was more than that and with fries was $12+. It was twice as expensive but the fries were better. The burger had way more meat than the other two. 
Five Guys doesn't have a drive through so you have to walk in. 
Five Guys has free peanuts!
Five Guys has so many different toppings compared to the other two plus I like the grilled onions slightly better than the raw ones on the other burgers. 
Five Guys is a 5 star place with service and food. Five Guys a 3 star place with prices and no drive through","1/25/2019",10
"Five Guys","They've gone downhill and I'm no longer a fan. The prices don't match the poor quality. I shouldn't have to add extra salt to a burger to make it edible.  No one wants to eat unseasoned ground beef.","3/26/2018",7
"Five Guys","Decided to get take out from this place last Friday night. I ordered a bunless bacon cheese burger (due to a gluten allergy) with lettuce, tomato, grilled mushrooms, and A-1 and mayo. A-1 and mayo came in tiny cups on the side. 

The burger was ICE cold. Granted, it was take out, but the place is mere minutes from my house. The burger is thin and the toppings were minimal. The taste wasn't any better than a Burger King or McDonald's burger. 

Considering this burger without a bun came to a whopping 8.99 I would definitely say this was not worth the price. The prices here are greatly inflated: 5 bucks for a small order of fries and 2.50 for a drink? I won't be back.","1/22/2018",4
"Five Guys","Figured I'd give this review a couple days... 

I haven't had this spot in about a year and decided to place an order for pick up since we were craving some good fast food and also just moved into the area.

I may love their Cajun fries but let me just say that I was highly unsatisfied with the customer service I received upon picking up my order Sunday night. And it takes a lot for me to get pissed off as I've been in the restaurant industry before. 

Our order was supposed to be ready by 7:30. I get there on time but was told that it would be an additional 7 minutes until my order was ready, which was fine... 10 minutes roll around and still no food. Another 10 minutes and still haven't heard them call out my boyfriends name. The cashier saw me looking at her and asked if I needed something as if I hadn't talked to her 20 minutes ago letting her know I was here for online pick up. She told the cooks I still hadn't gotten my food, which then one of the cooks came up to me and told me someone already picked up my food 3 minutes ago. I could've lost it, but instead told him that I hadn't received any part of our order. After a brief staring contest the cook then decided that he'd remake our order as if it was such an inconvenience to him. 

Anyway, used to love this burger joint but would rather take my business elsewhere. With the fierce competition out there, customer service is everything to me.","6/4/2019",3
"Five Guys","I went to Five Guys for burgers tonight because they are close and usually good.  Tonight was the worst.  When I got home with the order, the bun on my burger was burnt and the meat was not fully cooked.  I requested grilled onions and half the onions were raw.  Could not eat but a few bites of the burger because of the cook on the burger and bun.  The burgers had no flavor or seasoning.  The fries tasted old and barely warm.  Didn't eat the fries because of the taste.  Again, no seasoning.  The prices on the burgers, fries and drinks have skyrocketed.  The prices are very high for the quality of food you get.  There are other places that are much better and cheaper.","7/14/2021",0
"Five Guys","At noon, on a Monday, at a strip mall with 5+ other spots with food, this was the only one that did not have a line out the door. So being in a rush, and in business attire, I decided to jump in here for a quick bite.

The cheeseburger and fries were delicious, but absolutely has the be the messiest bun-disintegrating experience I ever had.  Way too messy if you are dressed for work and need to go back afterwards.

Since I refuse to eat a burger with a fork/knife like the other suits are doing in here, I guess I will just get in line at the other spots next time.","7/22/2019",1
"Five Guys","You seriously cannot go wrong by eating a burger at 5 guys. In fact they are about the only place I get a burger.  I'm not the burger type :/ but once that craving hits me, I'm headed str8 for the nearest 5 guys.  I love the fries, Cajun style!  

My visit was right before closing. Allan F was so helpful, kind and thoughtful.  He made my visit a great 1","8/8/2017",1
"Five Guys","I ordered a little cheeseburger and a little fry with Cajun seasoning 20 minutes before you all closed. 
When I got home and opened my bag my fries was loaded with seasoning.  I really think they were trying to kill me. I ate a few fries and got super irritated because seasoning was just everywhere. I had to use napkins to scrape the seasoning off. That didn't still help it. I had not ate five guys in a while and I understand why. That was a horrible experience.","9/20/2017",1
"Five Guys","If you have a severe peanut allergy, this is not the place for you! If you just have an issue after eating them like I do, you can still get down at Five Guys, just minimize how often you touch the tables. 

I really love Five Guys because the burgers are amazing, you basically get unlimited toppings from their giant list, and they have amazing fries. First you choose between a regular burger and a little burger, the only difference being that the regular burger gets two meat patties. Then you decide if you want cheese or bacon, the only additions that come at an additional price. Choose as many or as little additional toppings as you like from the list of lettuce, tomato, pickles, peppers, grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, etc. and various sauces like ketchup, BBQ sauce, mayo, and more. I always suggest getting the zesty Cajun fries and sharing a regular size between two people. However, you can request a side of Cajun seasoning if you decide to share or just want a little sampling. 

They offer Coke products and have the soda machines that allow you to add flavors to the regular drinks. There's ample parking in the shared plaza lot, so don't worry about finding parking!","6/11/2017",2
"Five Guys","I went once before this time in December  and loved it. Met my husband up for lunch since he has never tried it and then this happened.. An employee went nuts and starting yelling and throwing everything. I took the picture from exactly where i was sitting. Not only was it terrifying with a psycho employee that kept throwing everything, leaving, coming back and repeating until I called 911. On top of that, I got a plain burger and bun with nothing on it that I ordered. My husband got half what he ordered for his first time trying this and the last. We didn't even get offered a refund or ANYTHING, not even an apology. How do you employ these people and thanks for wasting my time and money.","2/5/2019",5
"Five Guys","Dayum, definitely do not order online for pickup! Came into location when order was due for pickup, was told it would be a few minutes for the fries, and then proceeded to wait almost 20 minutes for staff to acknowledge they had forgotten to hand the order over. They filled all orders for dining in customers, using all of the cooked fries, and making me wait even longer to make more. The staff member deflected with excuses and refused to do anything about my now cold sandwich.

Sorry Five Guys, you lost a customer.","11/20/2018",2
"Five Guys","This is the worst five guys in the country. Been here a couple times and everytime it gets worse. Last 3 burgers had wet buns and made wrong. 2 times back to back ordered grilled jalapenos and didnt recieved them. Also ordered 2 bacon cheeseburgers and they forgot the bacon and jalapenos. I dont think it is acceptable when you mainly sell burgers. Fries are always mushy and the consistency of either a baked potatoes or mashed potato. This franchise is a shame to the brand. Needs to close.","9/27/2018",3
"Five Guys","I came here on Feb 15 and DFW had been hit hard by a severe winter weather and power outages and most restaurants were closed or delayed. This Five Guys(FG) opened late at noon. I got there at noon and was the 5th person in line but soon the line wrapped around the  inside. These guys were swamped but four employees performed like a well-oiled machine taking orders snd cranking out meals. My burger was great and love the old style taste of their burgers and fresh fries. They are so much better than the Cal burger joint across the street. Kudos for these employees and FG for opening up and getting people meals during the snow and ice storm. Great place.","3/28/2021",0

Weird I thought but they told me I forgot to pick up my other burger and to go back and get it . Sounds very minimal but meant a lot !!!!

"Five Guys","I went to Five Guys today for lunch, was asking the server if I they had any hamburger buns without the sesame seeds, sadly they didn't. Other than that, they got our order right.","4/27/2021",0
"Five Guys","It's all about the Fries and malt vinegar.  
It reminds me of traveling to Ohio when I was a little girl.  
Malt vinegar on fries and salt&vinegar potato chips. (now their everywhere)

The burgers are great, I like adding grilled jalapeños, bacon, cheese, mustard, mushrooms, grilled onions... don't judge, I'm just building my burger with extra love.  

The staff is super friendly, but I did notice one thing that cause me to raise an eyebrow (why the 4 stars instead of 5).  The young lady at the register would double job responsibilities  ..she also cleaned the dining area and did some sweeping when she had no customers.  Which means she touched the trash can a lot not to mention items left on the tables.  When a customer came in, she would go back to the register without washing her hands.  Why is this a problem?   Because she exchanges money, receipts AND hands out cups.  At very minimum she should pump hand sanitizer. :-(

Oh yes, you get peanuts (in the shell) to snack on as you wait for your food.","10/11/2015",2
"Five Guys","Up there in the Top 5 Best best burgers!
Great meat, super bun, fresh veggies all married to perfection packed in tin foil.
Had a hot dog, but that is not their forte.
Fries are unique, simply unique.
Peanuts always help wait for your treat.
Milkshakes are worth it...","10/17/2018",0
"Five Guys","They have good burgers and I do like their fries. However, I got the smallest burger they had, smallest fry they had, and no drink and it was $11. This is almost double the price of many many burger places in the area that come with a burger, fries, and drink. I can't figure out why it's so expensive. I would come here more but it costs just way too much for what you get.","7/25/2019",1
"Five Guys","I ordered a bacon cheeseburger w fries. ain't get my bacon or my 2 patties,my fries. For a 18$ Meal I expect better ‍Unbelievable!","8/20/2020",0
"Five Guys","Usually satisfied when I come here but last night sucked. I ordered a little bacon cheeseburger with onions, mayo, A1, and jalapeños and an order of fries. My burger was missing the bacon and jalapeños and the fries were cold even though I had to wait for them to be done once I got there.","12/22/2019",0
"Five Guys","Let me just say this place is pretty expensive. But the great thing about it is that you can get unlimited peanuts. I go there and get a burger and then I take a nice big bag of peanuts to go. The burgers are definitely fresh and the fries or even better. they really give you a lot of fries.","1/22/2018",0
"Five Guys","I went to this five guys location by my new house. Always been a big fan. They couldn't take credit cards. So I went & got cash. Then came back and ordered a burger & they did give me free fries for not taking credit cards. They had 6 old patties that were just sitting on the grill. They were there for a while. They gave me one of those old burgers. It was cold, disgusting! Will not come back to this location. Sad!","10/27/2019",0
"Five Guys","To start off, I love burgers, and when I want a burger I really want the whole greasy burger experience. I've been to five guys multiple times in the past at other locations and have always been pleased. 

If you're wanting a nice juicy greasy burger with tons of toppings free of charge, this is a great choice. They are fairly consistent with the food and pretty quick. 

I usually get a double cheeseburger when I come, add grilled onions, jalapeños, lettuce tomato and mayo to my burger here. They cook the burger meat how you like, and I like mine a little pink in the center so I usually go medium. The order of fries here are huge so if you come with someone else, I'd suggest sharing an order before ordering two. 

All in all, I'd probably return if I was craving a burger I know that is consistently good, especially since it's pretty close to my work.","11/28/2014",4
"Five Guys","Only reason they are getting 2 stars is because they messed up my order and weren't apologetic about it after letting them know.  I had to make another trip to place another order.  

I will say they have good burgers and their Cajun fries are amazing.  They just need to do a better job training their staff to listen and take better orders.","9/19/2019",0
"Five Guys","Prices have skyrocketed  here which is weird with In and Out Burger across the street. The coffee shake was good but expensive, but the fries were almost 5 dollars and got  a cup of them. They used to give a generous portion before. Won't return.","3/9/2019",1
"Five Guys","$17 for a single burger, fries and a shake. The Milkshake was thin, waited 20 minutes for my food in an uncrowded restaurant. There is nothing seventeen dollars special about this tiny burger. I think the hype with this place is just that.","8/25/2019",0
"Five Guys","One of my favorite burger joints. Such a good variety of toppings for your burger at no extra charge. Fry sizes are great, and I suggest getting a small order for 2 people as there are a LOT of fries. Everything is cooked when you order so you know it is fresh. Peanuts are also available to eat while you wait for your food. Never have had any problems with the food and the staff is always friendly!","8/24/2019",0
"Five Guys","Hamburger was hot right off the grill wasn't sitting under a heating lamp.
Only downside about my order was I ordered no mushrooms on my burger and it had mushrooms on it.","11/20/2016",1
"Five Guys","Tonight was the first night I walked into this place.. And I think the crowd followed us.. Burger was good just check to make sure everything you ordered was placed on the burger.. Fries were enough to share and the staff does do a good job of cleaning the peanuts. Just a note on the peanuts.. Very salty and not that best quality..","3/29/2015",0
"Five Guys","Don't waste ur time. This place is disgusting one of the workers kept eating stuff off of the burgers they were making for me! When he put it in the bag they threw sauce in the bag and he tried to rewear my burger. A piece of bacon fell out and he grabbed it and put it in his mouth. Smhhh it's gross","3/23/2019",0
"Five Guys","Pretty tasty. My family goes here when we want something better than a fast food burger. The quality is definitely better. Good fries.","8/6/2019",0
"Five Guys","Awesome!! I've been coming to Five Guys for years. I always recommend it to new comers. Delicious burgers that will definitely hit the spot. The prices are fair too.","11/28/2016",1
"Five Guys","Five Guys is definitely my go-to for burgers in Las Colinas! They are always fresh, juicy and fully loaded! Not to mention the massive amount of fries you get! Highly recommended!","5/15/2018",2
"Five Guys","Burgers are good. But very busy in lunch hour. Free peanuts. If you have allergy to peanuts avoid this place completely","6/28/2018",1
"Five Guys","Had the veggie sandwich and fries. Fries were on point, but the sandwich is BS: it's literally just cold burger toppings on a bun, and in the same quantity as you'd get with a burger. Was super disappointing.","3/4/2019",0
"Five Guys","$7.50 for one small burger with no fries? I walked out, went directly across the street to in and out, got a burger MEAL for $5.50 plus tax. I will never step foot in one of these places again. What a joke.","11/27/2017",1
"Five Guys","Five Guys is consistently good and that makes it my favorite middle-ground burger choice between fast food and a proper restaurant. The servings are generous so you can typically order less than expected and walk away satisfied (if not painfully full). Larger burgers, their regular size, are tough to eat once you've added a variety of toppings like grilled onions and mushrooms.","12/22/2015",0
"Five Guys","I really do like this place. They always make great burgers the way you want it. Greasy in a bag. It may not look like a large burger, but man does it pack a punch. I just want to take a nap every time I come here to eat. There are peanuts there for you to go hog wild if you want to increase your sodium intake while you wait. 

I was once asked what I thought about this joint verses the one I went to in NYC. Honestly, there is no difference. Both make great burgers. Dont forget those sesoned fries. They are packed with awesomess.","10/24/2014",9
"Five Guys","Rarely do I complain about the price at a restaurant but this is a little excessive. 35 dollars for two burgers and fries? The burgers are no better than McDonald's quarter pounder and anyone who says differently is fooling themselves. The fries taste like they forgot to wash the dirt off of them and who cares where your potatoes are from? Why post that on the wall with all the generic compliments from no-name critics. The Willy Wonka of burgercrafting. What does that even mean!? It's a bun (that was stale and essentially compressed crumbs) and two mediocre burger patties. I think Wonka was a tad bit more creative than adding... ONIONS!!  Nonsense. Save 20 bucks and go to McDonald's.","10/22/2016",3
"Five Guys","When it comes to finding a burger place on the mainland, I always find myself trying to look for a five guys burger. Though some people may like in and out burger and others may like other burger places; I find myself always looking for a five guys burger. From the first time I try to five guys burger in Washington DC to the last time I had a five guys burger in Dallas Texas, I still love five guys burger.
I don't know any other burger place where you can go and order a standard burger and all the toppings are free. When it comes to designing a custom burger or a burger the way you want it, five guys is the place to go. But don't forget to leave some room for the french fries. If you like seasoning on your fries, you should definitely try the Cajun fries.","7/10/2015",0
"Five Guys","Great burger spot in the las colinas area! The menu is small but it's great. There's burgers (2 patties) and little burgers (1 patty) and you can add cheese or bacon to them. Also, there Cajun fries are AMAZING. You can get them either Cajun or five guys style. I think 5 guys style is just with salt but not 100% sure, someone correct me if I'm wrong the cool thing about their fries are that they're absolutely fresh and they're brought from places all over the US daily. Little sized fries was about 3$ but they're worth it. Little sized is plenty of fries in my opinion, me and my brother usually share a little or medium sized fries. Also, they do serve shakes in all sorts of flavors (chocolate vanilla Oreo cookies and cream and more) and those are very very rich in flavor. I got the cookies and cream and it was perfect. The only issue with it though it was expensive (4.50$) and it's not a huge shake for that price but if I was in a splurge mood again I'd definitely get it again! You can also add bacon to any of the shakes! 
Oh almost forgot, the wait was like 5-10 minutes, the workers are chill and nice and you can eat some peanuts while you wait! 
Overall, this place is a little pricier than average but they have a good reason to be! The extra cost is worth it. Will definitely return. 
Pro tip* if you get the bacon cheeseburger, you can add extra cheese or bacon for free!","1/8/2017",1
"Five Guys","Disclaimer: this restaurant is in no way related to any sort of porn and is not affiliated with PornHub Corporations. *Cracks knuckles* So, I walked into this establishment believing their world-renowned burgers would taste like the American Dream. However, a more accurate description would be that they tasted closer to Nazi Germany when they invaded Poland. At minimum, I wanted my panties to drop faster than you can say Redhead fucks wetback w huge cock. My pussy was so fucking dry by the end that you could've soaked it in gasoline and lit a fire down there. My burger and fries were more expensive than my Mexican boob job. So, get ready to become a dick sucking pro *including straight guys* because that will be your only form of currency from now on. In conclusion, if you wanna be a Nazi, eat at Five Guys.","7/7/2019",0
"Five Guys","This is the first time that I have tried 5 Guys and Fries. This place didn't disappoint. We get free peanuts :)

The service was good and so were the burgers. They don't skimp on the fries and they were really good.","1/9/2015",0
"Five Guys","I was riding with my friend and the minute they saw a five guys they literally took the most dangerous u turn I've ever seen in my whole life (like the kind in movies) to make an impromptu stop at the best burger place EVER!. We weren't even looking for lunch! We were going to go buy me a kitty. Anyway...if it takes 5 guys to make that burger then they need to find something else to do. Maybe these five guys could get together and make a fantastic circus act or something. It wasn't bad (love the sesame seed bun!) but Red Robin is better. 
By the way...I never got my kitty. Thanks Five Guys.","4/2/2011",0
"Five Guys","The boss wanted to head here for lunch and we were more than happy to give it a try. It just opened and since it was lunch time in Irving, it was crowded. Though the line was long we got through it rather quickly and were served probably within 10 minutes. 

It's a burger bar for sure. Order...Get Drink...Find Seat...Eat. The burgers are rather simple but large. Don't be fooled by the small burger offering. The only difference between small and normal is an extra hamburger paddy. 

They are super efficient in telling you their regional/national fame having it simply plastered along the walls and even give you the location your potatoes are coming from for the day. Not too shabby, really. 

Perfect quick burger for cheap.","11/19/2010",0
"Five Guys","For starters, it's a WHOLE heckuva lot better than the place across the street with the palm trees out front!  The staff is always friendly and even during their busier times, the tables are kept clean and free of trash and crumbs. There are free peanuts to munch on while you wait for your order.  I love their delicious greasy burgers.  I'm not a bread person, so I always order my cheeseburger in a bowl with lettuce and other tasty toppings (they have lots of choices). Burger has 2 patties (which they'll holler at the cooks when you order), Little Burger has one patty for those with smaller appetites (what's that like??) and then there is a 3-patty option which I'm not brave enough to attempt.
The fries are awesome too, fresh cut and cooked to order in peanut oil.  I prefer the Cajun seasoned option because I like things spicy, but I have no problem devouring the regular fries too.  Depending on the size you order, they fill that size of cup and then take a scoop and dump a whole bunch more on top in the bag.  I used to only be able to go with a buddy so I had someone to share fries with, but fairly recently they added a Little Fries as an option to those who hate wasting food (god help my waistline!).
They also have hot dogs, which are pretty good.  My husband likes to order the dog and then load it up with all the tasty toppings including peppers, onions, bacon, tomatoes, hot sauce, etc. 
There is nothing fancy, gourmet or pretentious about this place; it is simply a solid basic burger joint and it is oh soooo delicious...","1/14/2015",0
"Five Guys","I am on the quest for the Holy Grail of burgers.  Unfortunately, Five Guys isn't it...but it's good.

I don't remember what the hubs had, but I had the bacon cheeseburger with lettuce, tomato, and...I don't remember what else, to be honest.  But they have a pretty big list of toppings and you can get as many as you want at no extra cost!  Sweet.  This is a medium-thin patty burger, for those wondering.  (I wish more people would be specific about the size/thickness of patties in their burger reviews because I prefer a more medium-thick patty, but I digress.)  Kinda greasy, but not too salty.

We shared an order of fries to give them a whirl and I will agree that the small is plenty for two people.  I am not usually a huge fry fanatic unless they are super fancy cheese fries or something, but these were pretty good.  They're not too thin (shoestring), but not too thick (steak) and they still have some skin on them.  If you like your fries lightly crispy with a good amount of give, you will enjoy these.  By the way, they have a sign that changes daily that tells you the origin of the potatoes they are using that day, haha.  They also have free peanuts in the shell for you to munch while you wait for your food.

My final thoughts are that their burgers are as good or better than In-N-Out (better only because of the multitude of toppings and bacon) and the fries are DEFINITELY better than In-N-Out.  Not bad at all...but I still have to continue my quest.","5/14/2014",2
"Five Guys","Usually bring the kids here once every couple of weeks. Good burgers, plenty of free toppings that can easily double the size of the sandwich, and you always get tons of fries for the money. Customer service is sometimes hit or miss, but usually is pretty good.","7/12/2018",1
"Five Guys","The service was good when we went in for lunch on Thursday. Order at the counter and then pick up at another counter. However, the guy who took my order brought it out to me. That was nice! Lots of fries in an order and they were excellent. Probably the best fries I've had. Certainly enough for 2 or even 3 people. The burger was good. I liked the bread, soft but not soggy. Just right. Fresh ingredients, including the jalapenos. BUT, the only negative was there were only about three small slices of jalapeno on the whole burger! Not good. I wanted to try a hot dog, but they don't serve chili.

I'd go back for lunch. I liked it.","12/6/2013",4
"Five Guys","We were  here for lunch with my friend. Good thing in this place is you can take as many different toppings as you want. Bad thing is meat, it's not bad but i ate a lot of better hamburgers.","7/20/2017",0
"Five Guys","Best made to order burgers around. Love all the toppings and the portions are ginormous. Order a small fry if you go, because even a small is more than one person should eat especially if you get the double burger.","1/20/2015",0
"Five Guys","I placed an online order for delivery almost two hours ago and I still haven't received my food. I called the dasher listed on there and he is now telling me he will be at my place in 30 minutes, totally unacceptable.","8/9/2017",0
"Five Guys","Have to bump Five Guys to 4 stars...some of the best burgers you can get from a national chain-type restaurant. There is an In-N-Out just across MacArthur...avoid the lines there and come walk in to Five Guys...you'll get a better burger and better fries.

Again, if you're stopping by for yourself, no matter how hungry you feel, get the SMALL fries...the large is beyond enough for two, maybe three people, so the small will do you just fine and you'll have extra to spare.

I would put Five Guys at the top of the national chains, but in Dallas-Fort Worth, you've got your work cut out for you if you want to compete for best. Liberty Burger and Twisted Root get my votes for best local joints in DFW, but Five Guys will do if you don't have the time for a nice, sit-down burger meal.","1/19/2014",1
"Five Guys","This place is like in-and-out burger, in that I think the hype machine is a little strong.  To hear about it you would think it the best in the world.  But its not that good.  Now in this case I think its right up there, hence the 4 stars.  Its a really good burger, fresh and juicy.  Pretty standard in selection, fries are ok  Everything is done well.  I love burgers so 5's are like majical places for me, so a 4 is a respectable score.  I always look at it like this, is it good enough for me to go back.  I would make a trip for this place.","3/25/2016",1
"Five Guys","My first visit to 5 guys. I had heard good things, but to be honest, I wasn't impressed. Nothing wrong, just pretty generic. Service was OK. They forgot that I asked for BBQ sauce on my burger, but quickly got me a cup of it when I asked. I won't go out of my way, but would come back again if I was with a group that wanted it.","1/7/2017",0
"Five Guys","I generally love Five Guys, but was disappointed in this particular location for a couple of reasons.

What prompted me to visit was that I'd read online about a secret menu at Five Guys wherein you could get cheese fries.  I asked about it and they didn't have it.  Disappointing, but oh well. 

Next, I ordered a bacon cheeseburger.  It came out very quickly, but had no bacon on it.  This was devastating to me.

Also, Five Guys' weakest point has always been their fries, and I felt that the fries here were particularly soggy.

The girl who took my order was nice, although she did give me a look as  though I were insane when I asked about the cheese fries.","8/28/2013",1
"Five Guys","Forget the oh so ordinary burger, and too soggy fries (order 'em crispy, though, and they're very good, and superplentiful)- this place has the best hot dog on the planet, bar none, and I am a lifelong hot dog connoisseur from Chicago :P  I get mine with grilled onions, mushrooms (yes, mushrooms), fresh jalapenos, pickles, relish, and bbq sauce.  They butterfly and grill the dog to charred, moist perfection, put it on a pillowy fresh grilled bun, and wrap it tight in foil to let the flavors and juices meld prior to consumption.  Scoop some complimentary roasted peanuts, pour the cold bev of your choice (soft drinks only :( ), and sitcherself down for some ethereal eatin'.  For a grand total of $3.23 including tax (drinking aqua), it is the finest culinary value in the city.","6/16/2013",3
"Five Guys","To expensive, good looking bugers fast and easy always do they hook it up with extra fried, hint don't eat in your car it will small like fast food for 3 days!","2/1/2016",0
"Five Guys","As I walk in to pick up my food, this review might be slightly premature, but I have been here dozens of times. It has always been very consistent and very good. The staff is friendly, and always helpful. Like other locations, obviously you can heap on the toppings and they have the cool Coke machine where you can pretty much get about any flavor you like.","5/26/2016",0
"Five Guys","Tasty burger...fresh cut fries. All around solid meal.  Love the fact you can build your own burger and the combos are endless. Will most certainly go back for more. Not a consistent option but when a craving strikes I won't argue it.","4/25/2016",0
"Five Guys","Very good food... The burger was tasty. I didn't like the community eating style where you share table with others. It reminds me of a cafeteria. The workers were very nice and we went during lunch hour although it took a while to get our food we had the peanuts to keep us busy so it was a win win situation.","4/15/2016",0

"Five Guys","Step up from McDonalds
Step down from Mooyahs
Light years from Kennys

Another chain rears its ugly head in the humble town of Las Colinas. Big effing surprise.","12/9/2010",2
"Five Guys","They get kudos for service...

...they came by the tables asking patrons if they needed anything else; they have free peanuts in shells for spontaneous snacking; they exhibit great teamwork at the pass; they include a handful of napkins without needing to be asked; they are happy to give a larger cup for water without skipping a beat.

They get high-fives for the fries...

...plentiful serving size; served hot; well-salted but not too much to enjoy; thick meaty fries dominate the serving with only a few rare crispy slivers; made fresh daily with a big sign announcing which farm's potatoes are featured in the fries.

But, they get ho-hum yawns for the burger...

...tasted the same to me as Mooyah; bland, plain, flavorless; grease-wrapped in aluminum foil with all that melted cheesy mess - sounds good, but it's just a slimy mess when the burger tastes so boring.

I can't believe out of FIVE guys, not one of them ever heard of seasoning burger patties.","4/19/2011",3
"Five Guys","It's a perfectly fine basic burger joint. Iliked the fries. I liked the burger. The decor was a bit public restroom, but that is just the style.

I liked the way they leave you alone. 

I simply find it to be just what the dr. ordered when I get a hankering for a greasy burger and fries. Oh and they have malt vinegar. That's important. They don't have mayo for the fries and that's sad :-( Oh well, I'll be back.","2/10/2011",1
"Five Guys","Fresh is the first word that comes to mind.  The burger was hot off the flat top, very juicy, and just generally delicious.  

I don't get the fries.  They are sort of natural cut and big.  They were hot out of the fryer.  Very bland though.  It's called salt.

Also, I feel like $11.87 for burger, fries, and a drink is over priced.  But that burger was damn good.  should be pretty easy to get served around lunch when the In n Out opens across the street.","8/23/2011",2
"Five Guys","It's just a food bomb. The burgers are mealy and not particularly tasty. Fries are inconsistent and overseasoned. The fact that they pile a hundredweight of them into your order gives an illusion of value but they get cold quickly and are generally just greasy and not very good. The grilled onions are a good topping, I'll say that for them.

Given that this place is just a few blocks from both Smashburger and In-n-Out, among others, I don't recommend it at all.","5/13/2013",1
"Five Guys","I kept hearing whispers about this place so I decided to finally check it out.

The hamburger tasted fine. Nothing special. Almost like a fresher and bigger whataburger. 

The fries were OK as well. I think they paid those newspapers for the quotes plastered all over the walls. One thing to note. An order of fries is EASILY enough for 2 people. So save a few bucks if you're with someone and share.

Overall - its not with 11$ for a hamburger, fries and a drink. In my humble opinion.","11/4/2011",2
"Five Guys","I am a huge fan of five guys generally but this location does not measure up to others. 

First off, the cashier likes to swindle you for extra change or maybe a dollar by accident. They do not seem very professional at all. The burger was served up to go like slop. When I unwrapped it, the mayo was dripping out of the burger which caused the lettuce to slide of pulling just about everything with it. This is not customary for five guys. The proper time and diligence was not taken. 

I was rather saddened by this location as it is so close to my work. It is well kept but I think the staff needs more structure.","9/22/2013",0
"Five Guys","All our burgers are well done and juicy!

Firstly... I like my burgers medium well because medium well burgers are juicy and  you don't have that big a risk of needing to visit your friend John for much needed relief later on.

Secondly... the burgers we ordered were NOT well done. Not medium well. Maybe medium. Can you imagine expecting a well done burger and biting into one just to see the pink and red meat? Eek.

I didn't like this joint. I've seen the chains around and my interest was piqued so I had to try it. A line out the door and a full-house was promising. Signs that boasted the best fries...  and voted best burger... I don't remember where; probably some ho-dunk town in Arkansas. The food was served in paper bags and grease gleamed through. Grease isn't a bad thing. As a matter of fact, it was also a promising thing.

The fries were ok. And granted the burger was juicy (because it wasn't well done), this isn't a place I'd be dying to go to again.","11/22/2010",1
"Five Guys","Still my preference for to-go burgers due to the easy online ordering. Five Guys hasn't failed me yet; nearly half-inch thick patties provide that beefy mouth feel that's the trademark of a good burger. Every order I've made here has been executed perfectly without error. And I still can't get enough of their Cajun fries. If only they'd give a temperature option for their burger then I'd be really happy.

I still wouldn't dine onsite though; uncomfortable seating, screaming banners, and red/white tile color scheme just doesn't do it for me.","2/25/2011",1
"Five Guys","Love five guys especially this location! Food is always fresh, the service is always quick and friendly, and it's always a pleasant experience when I go there. I don't end up waiting 20 minutes for my food like when I try way back burgers. It's nice to know I can go there and get my food and still make it back to work on time.","12/8/2015",0
"Five Guys","This place is great. The staff was cool and my food was made fresh!  I'll definitely come back.","9/14/2015",0
"Five Guys","If you want a greeeezy burger and a bag full of fries, Five Guys will do you right.

The burger was good but I just don't see the link to all the LOOK AT ME reviews all around the wall.   Sure, if you work/live in LC, it's worth your time.  You order, be specific about what you want, and pay five to ten Georges.  

I dig all toppings are free and that you can feed two additional small children with the amount of fries you get.

Lesson learned...go with the Little Burger.  Otherwise, you are getting two big patties of meat.","1/5/2011",1
"Five Guys","I don't know what the hype is about for this place. The burger tasted like my mom's burgers. I mean EXACTLY. Usually you would think that is a good thing but I dislike my mom's burgers for the lack of flavor and being boring. I dislike that there is no special sauce that they offer. I asked for the bbq sauce but they FORGOT it. I thought no biggie- until I bit into the burger. Then I had to ask for the sauce. :( The burgers taste fresh I'll give them that, but the flavor is not there. I think they just use onions if at all. Meh. The bun? Straight out of a 6-pack at the grocery. I'd rather have burger king, in n out, or whataburger. Please, I want my $4 back- so overpriced! The cajun fries were good though...

Another thing I didn't like is the lack of branding on their packaging. It would be good for the company to invest in more than just a brown paper bag and white cups. Especially for the price we have to pay.","3/19/2011",1
"Five Guys","Ho-hum.  Overall, most of the reviews for Five Guys are based on the incredible french fries (mainly the amount of them), and that the burgers are secondary.  I'd say that yes, while I did like the large amount of fries (2 people can share a regular order), they weren't worth raving about.  And frankly, the burger was pretty darn good.  

They do cook them all the same (good luck getting one medium rare, it's more toward medium well), but it was still flavorful and juicy somehow.  The free toppings is a nice adder, so you can range from a plain burger to adding on at least 10 different toppings at no extra charge which is nice.  The other thing that I really liked was that their jalapenos are not pickled, which makes them much spicy and tasty better if you're a spicy food fan like I am. 

I'd come back to Five Guys again, but it didn't rock my world.","12/15/2010",1
"Five Guys","I would much rather go here than Smashburger.
But I would rather go to Red Robin than here.

It's a step up from Smashburger. I came in here with no expectations and it was just the kind of burger I was looking for. The greasy, wipe-bite-wipe-bite kind. It has a very laid back environment.

Takes longer than I'm used to but it's pretty much worth it. Especially the cajun fries! I've had regular fries before. Crispy but nothing special.

All in all, it's a good place if you want a good, juicy burger. Although I just had a Whataburger burger for lunch today and that one seemed more flavorful. 

Not disappointing but not impressive either. Just try it for yourself.","3/28/2011",1
"Five Guys","I never knew there was a Five Guys in Irving, so I decided to give it a shot and see what all the fuss was about.  Now, I'm sure it's just some form of hype.

Service was good, but the food leaves much to be desired.  My cheeseburger was a decent size since they do double meat, but the burger was bland.  I asked for mine with mustard, which I got, but I could barely taste it.  The fries were pretty good, but they give you too much!  Apparently, their idea of 'regular' fries is to have enough for at least 2 people (not single person friendly).  I think I threw out half the fries they gave me.  

All this, including tax, ran me $11.77.  Unbelievable!!!  Six dollars for a mediocre burger is a waste of money.  Also, getting so many fries for just one person is a waste of food.  I cannot recommend this place to anybody.  Don't believe the hype.","8/30/2011",1
"Five Guys","I Love LOVE Love Five Guys!!!
I'm not a huge fan of the hot dogs, I just don't think they should
ever be sliced. The hamburger's are worth screaming in the streets
about and the same with french fry's (sry freedom fry's). Five Guy is the traditional East Coast burger joint, if you didn't like it than go back to your 
Whataburger.","3/23/2011",0
"Five Guys","Ranks up there with the best.  Fresh fries, great burger and the place was spotless.  Both my wife and I stopped to have a burger and fries and it was as good as we expected.  My only mistake was finding out that they use fresh jalapenos instead of the pickeled.  I didn't order them because I thought they would be out of jar and I prefer the real thing.  I will definately have them next time.","11/6/2011",0
"Five Guys","Above average burgers, the fries were good but a bit soggy. Expect to pay over $10 for a burger fries and a drink.","8/26/2015",0
"Five Guys","We ordered to go, our food was not prepared according to our order. We had to throw the burger when we got home.","7/7/2017",0
"Five Guys","One of the better burgers in town.   Yes, the burgers and fries are greasy, but they're also freaking good!!!  

You get more fries than you can ever dream of!  That's their stick, and it's a good one.

Better than Smashburger??  Oh so much better!  

One downside....I can get a double 1/4lb w/ Cheese meal at McDonalds and large fry and drink for $7bux.   It's darn near $11bux...so price is an issue.","2/11/2011",0
"Five Guys","Was in the mood for a tasty, filling burger meal for an early dinner, so saw this place and decided to try it.  I'd been to the one in Cypress, TX and it was OK.

Similar experience here.  The burger was pretty small even though there were two very fresh, very hot patties in it.  Lots of dripping grease, which actually is OK by me because it indicates a juicy and tasty burger most times.  And it was - just a bit small for the $5+ price tag for only the sandwich: no fries and no drink.

The price/value ratio is a bit on the low side, which is why I give them 3 stars.  Just like the other one.","9/12/2011",0
"Five Guys","I was expecting a lot from this place after all the hype about them being the best burgers in town.  This being Irving, it was packed at 12:30, we nevertheless ordered and found a seat quite quickly.  A Cheeseburger with Fries and coke was a little over $10.. pricey.. but the burger must be fantastic..

We got the order in about 5 min and it was a good sized meal with all the toppings and the fries. ( a lot of fries in the regular). The bun was cold though. I dont get it... why ?  It put a damper on the whole burger. The burger was definitely tasty.. try it with the Jalepenos.

Not sure ill come back. I like Mooyah better and then there is Fudruckers, both with toasted buns.

They have a veggie sandwich and veggie cheese sandwich.. I will ask the wife to try it out and let you know how it went later.","11/29/2010",0
"Five Guys","Really cant beat this place..... Best basic delicious burger.... I do know there are quite a few burger places service delicious burgers in D town, but this one was close to the hotel I stayed at so it was perfect.....

Great food, great burger everytime.......","8/16/2012",0
"Five Guys","Great burgers with many options and Cajun fries.  Menu is small but most items are good. Fries are local produce and made fresh but sometimes not cooked a crispy as I would like.","12/3/2015",0
"Five Guys","So I had a chance to finally try this place out.  The cajun fries are spiced perfectly and the burger was good.  Not worth the $10 I had to pay for my meal though!  Jeez, I got the little cheeseburger (with only 1 patty) and just that itself was $5!  I could've gone across the street to In n' Out and gotten two meals for the price I paid for one at Five Guy's.  

Consolation:  they do serve free peanuts.","1/19/2012",0
"Five Guys","Very friendly staff!  Very helpful. Food was quick and delicious. Staff checked on us to make sure we were doing ok. My daughter left her book and they returned it to is before we left.","8/13/2017",0
"Five Guys","This place is across the street from me, and I just realized you can order via phone and have it ready when you arrive. 

The staff has always been friendly and efficient. I prefer the burgers and fries here rather than In-and-Out across the street.

Definitely recommend. (Although I wish they had milkshakes -- real ones.)","4/15/2015",0
"Five Guys","The fries are the best.  They only buy potatoes from Idaho because they those are the best.  And they fry them in peanut oil.  So good.  And they burgers are great.  Clean eating area.  You can see into the area where they cook and that is spotless as well.","11/25/2014",0
"Five Guys","Great place for a good burger! If you want a small, but very dense burger, this is it! I will caution you, however, that two healthy eaters can split a large order of fries. The fry portions are generous and come in plain or Cajun. For those of you who would like to test the outer limits of your stomach, proceed with caution! We like this place, and the decor is very simple. Has a 50's diner-esque feel to it, but boy is it busy around lunch! There is limited seating, so try to get there before the lunch rush to ensure that you get a spot. You know a place is good when you see people of all types and professions coming here for lunch or dinner! Convenient location, not too far off from 161, OR 114.

To Dieters:
This is not on your diet...that is...unless it's the seefood diet. :-p 
Greasy, heavy...but oh so delicious.","2/25/2013",0
"Five Guys","First of let me start by saying I'm not a burger person at all, but this is definitely one of my new favorite places I love the way the fries taste and burgers of course. my family and I we're looking for a fast, cheap, good place to eat and this meets all those :) we had gone to WHATABURGER earlier and we spent less money at this place.

And the staff is so friendly","1/21/2012",0
"Five Guys","So I've been hearing allot of hype.. I told my boyfriend I was in the mood for a good cheesy greasy burger.. ehh.. well It's cheesy and greasy.. and yeah I guess it's a pretty good burger. You can pretty much build it the way you want. 

I ordered the little cheeseburger (1 patty).. It kind of got lost between my toppings. Grilled mushrooms weren't that grilled and green peppers were pretty much raw. Fries were alright..lacking a little salt. I liked that they were natural cut but 1 regular serving was enough for both of us.

Staff was very friendly.. greeted you right away with a smile and very patient with me a first time customer. 

Overall if you're in the neighborhood and don't want a fast food chain hamburger I'd stop here. But I'm not driving out of my way for any special trips.","3/26/2012",0
"Five Guys","I am officially giving up on Five Guys.

The fries are greasy, way too salty, and limp.  The burgers tasteless.

But their unforgivable crime against meatness: they split their hotdogs down the middle.  They literally violate the integrity of the great American meat tube so they can cook them on a flattop.  And the results aren't that tasty.

It just ain't Texan.","7/2/2012",0
"Five Guys","Had frys very salty and grease burgers had not taste . Opposite to is in n out burgers are great and quality is good","1/20/2014",1
"Five Guys","I was not very impressed here.  I still like the one inside the Galleria Mall. They are fast and very efficient","7/3/2014",0
"Five Guys","Made an online order. Arrived a few minutes AFTER it was supposed to be ready...had to wait another 10mins after arriving before getting my order. The staff couldn't have cared less. The place was nearly empty but there was no urgency on their part to make an order that should have already been ready. Will never return to this location.","2/5/2017",0
"Five Guys","been here more than a few times so I can give a good review. The service for me has always been great and seems to always have a crowd no matter what time I eat. The food is good and better than any fast food burger. They are made to order and toppings are selected by you. I would stick to the single as the double is hard to fit on the bun offered. The fries are some of the best and like how they give you extra each time. 

As stated in previous reviews I would not go out of my way to go as it seems to take a while for order and grease in food can stop the heart you go too much. I would say go if you have not","9/7/2012",0
"Five Guys","If you're looking for a good burger, this is the place to go. It's a bit more expensive than most burger joints, but they make up for it in serving size. Way more food than I could eat. Wait time was a little bit longer than what I'm used to, but the food was prepared hot and fresh.","12/10/2014",0
"Five Guys","The first time I had a burger from here it was good but the bacon was over cooked. I've recently given this place a redo and have loved the bacon cheeseburger and bacon cheese hotdog made with whatever additions that you want. The Cajun fries are soo good!","7/24/2014",0
"Five Guys","Love, love, love, love these burgers!!  They're always fresh, and absolutely delish!","6/3/2014",0
"Five Guys","I probably would have given them three stars but...Well they have all these boasts all over the walls. Like BEST EVER. GOD SAID WERE THE BEST. YOU DONT LOVE US YOURE DUMB...Just overstated. So as Im waiting for my burger Im thinking...You 5 guys better be awesome. Ordered the regular which turns out is two patties. I wasnt in the mood for a two patty burger but ok...Bacon cheeseburger and a water. $6.50. I was like...ok. Fine. My buddy got the same but they asked him if he wanted fries and drink. SURE he says. $11! LOL WTF. That really jumped up right? Cmon Son! Anyways you can build your burger with any toppings which is cool, fries were just ok and not epic as the walls advertised. Burger was good not great as well. Just a letdown for me overall. Im in no hurry to go back and my buddy who dropped $11 said tell those 5 Guys to go F themselves.....","11/30/2010",4
"Five Guys","I've eaten here a few times now. The burger is quite good. It tastes like one I would u I'd make at home, which is what I am searching for in my dining out experiences. Yet, the price is just way too high. The fries are average and go cod quickly. I order them with Cajun seasoning to liven them up a bit. Avoid this I place if you're on a strict budget; otherwise, enjoy.","5/4/2014",0
"Five Guys","Crowded, noisy (both understandable during lunch rush, though), WAY overpriced (over 7 bucks for a little cheeseburger and fries, no drink??).  The fries were almost burnt and tasted disgusting. I won't be back.","5/19/2011",2
"Five Guys","People told me to go to five guys to try their burgers since they are the best. I eventually went and tried it out. I honestly have had way better burgers then the one I had here. It really wasn't anything special at all. I would rather go across the street to In N Out Burger, spend half the money and actually enjoy the burger.","11/15/2011",2
"Five Guys","This place has one of the best burgers (for the fast food category) that I've had. I like it better than In-N-Out. You can order the fries cajun or regular and they make it fresh as you order so it's not cold and sitting under the heat lamp for hours. Yummy place!","10/9/2011",1
"Five Guys","So I read all these reviews and was like... Ok, let me give it a try. How bad can it be right?  Well, way more than I could've ever imagined!!  Their burgers are greasy, have no flavor and are tiny. I have to say, service was great, but no where close to justify the almost twelve bucks I paid for the one meal. Definitely the rip off feeling when you walk out.","6/28/2014",0
"Five Guys","This isn't a bad place to try once, but nothing to brag home about. The fries were actually fantastic, but the burgers were pretty average. The burgers didn't have as much flavor as Twisted Root, Whataburger, or even Burger King, but they were still juicy and tender. The store carefully selects their potatoes for the fries, and even tells you exactly where the potatoes for the fries were gathered at a small board slightly beyond the entrance of the place, though, which is a pretty good thing. Overall, its worth a try, though don't get too excited about the burgers.","4/22/2014",0
"Five Guys","Need a greasy burger? Come here! I ordered the regular burger (which I didn't realize was 2 patties, for good or bad) with grilled onions, mushrooms (you can get both lite). And fries are what they should be i suppose - crisp and greasy, somewhat addictive.","1/19/2011",1
"Five Guys","I love Five Guys and I always get the little cheeseburger with ketchup, lettuce, tomato, pickle, and jalapeno.  The fresh jalapenos are excellent if you like a kick.  And of course the fries are great too.  I love that they always give you more fries than you need, but they are worth every last bite.  I get the regular fries.  The burgers are always great.  The staff at this location was ok.  The guy at the register very obviously checked me out as well as every other girl that came in to order.  He would give the full look up and down and it weirded me out a bit.  But otherwise it is quick and delicious!","7/12/2013",0
"Five Guys","Holy food coma! My cheeseburger was so good, and the added grilled onions and mushrooms were a great add on at no charge! The fries were great to fresh out of the fryer! We tried to finish them before we got back to even start on our burgers!","7/28/2011",1
"Five Guys","So for the first time going to Five Guys the food was great! The thing I didn't like was the pricing a large fries is like 7.25 a mini cheese burger was like 5 bucks it was insane","12/23/2015",0
"Five Guys","Better than any burger I have had in the DFW area.  When the fiancee and I have a craving we drive down MacArthur through all those dang lights to Five Guys.  Yes it is pricey for a burger and fries, yes you have to wait, but it is so worth it.  No other burger makes me eat so slow to enjoy every last bite.  The ingredients are so fresh and tasty and the fries are dangerously yummy.  We usually share a regular fry and drink to keep down costs, but it still costs us $14 with his two meat patty and my jr. burger.  I just hope one doesn't come to the Coppell/Lewisville area because I would quickly become a candidate for lap band.","2/23/2011",0
"Five Guys","Goodness knows I live for a good juicy burger, not the best But mmmmmm top10 best burgers fo sho!! And the fries Yeeeeeeeees they were seriously sexy, I'll see them again soon soon","1/26/2013",0
"Five Guys","I went for the small (single patty) burger and regular fries and enjoyed it much more.  The fries were very good; probably better than the burger.","7/11/2011",0
"Five Guys","Amazing,  best fresh burger! It's not a large one pound Burger but everything is really fresh. Burgers and fries are made to order and you can get whatever you want on it for no additional charge.  I love the fresh peanuts to munch on until our food comes. Fries are wonderful but it is plenty to share!  The service is always amazing,  the manager Brad fixed a small issue we had quickly one time.  We come to this location at least 2x a month.","6/11/2014",1
"Five Guys","Simply put Five Guys is too expensive for their wares. It's not bad, but at 10 dollars plus a combo they better be putting What-a-Burger through their paces, but it doesn't seem as if they are. The bulk peanuts are a nice touch, but they could use some salt! The interior looks like a revised version of Inn-n-Out, though their prices don't seem to have been imported along with the decor.","4/22/2011",0
"Five Guys","This place is okay but not in my top 5 places in Dallas that I would grab a burger. I always feel so full after eating there, but not the good kind of full, the gross kind. Everything tastes pretty good. I had the fries with the Cajun seasoning and probably would not go that route again. I am also not a fan of the peanuts on the ground thing. Other places have done it, and I guess it works..but at a burger place? Kinda gross. I do like the crispy burgers since they are cooked on a flattop and everything appears to be fresh. Just not my favorite.","2/15/2013",0
"Five Guys","Great burgers, great fries, definately the place to go whenever you are craving a good juicy burger!!","6/19/2011",0
"Five Guys","Best burger I have ever had! Seriously! try the cajun fries there to die for!!!","10/30/2011",0
"Five Guys","It's true there is or was a lot of hype surrounding Five Guys and it is overrated.  Why do I give it 3 stars because 2.75 stars is not an option.  The place always seems clean but too much five guys propaganda.

I've been to this location and other locations throughout TX.  The little burger (one patty) is just too small and you're better off getting the regular burger which consists of two patties.  The burger is good and slightly on the greasy/ juicy side not at all greased up like some people reviewed.  The buns seem a little weak but it does the job of a bun.  I do think it's overpriced for what you get.  I'd rather spend the same money and get the jalapeno bottled caps burger at Jake's (so delicious...yomyomyom).  

Anyways, the best part of five guys is the fries.  Order a small and they will still overflow your cup and fill your brown bag full of fries.  I usually get the cajun seasoning and the fries alone is probably the biggest reason that my dinero goes to this burger joint.  Put it this way, if they didn't have the fries, I would never go back just for the burger.  Not a bad place just a little above marginal, a solid C+.","1/27/2011",0
"Five Guys","Love Five Guys! Why? Because a cheeseburger with fresh cut jalapenos, onions, pickles, mustard, and ketchup is good as it gets.  Even though the burgers here are a little overpriced, I will pay the $$ to get it every once in awhile.  If you like crawfish, they serve fries molested with this seasoning but get the smaller portion because they put an extra scoop in your bag along with your order.  The more 2 star reviews, the better, since there will be less people during the lunch rush :)","9/7/2011",0
"Five Guys","I am so suprised by the reviews here!!  Both times I've been here, I was going along with coworkers and not really in the mood for burgers, but didn't want to rock the boat.   Both times, I was sad when I finished my burger because it was SO delicious.  Hot, juicy, and delicious - anything but bland, but if you just get mustard on your burger, maybe that would be why.   I always get the little bacon cheeseburger w/ mayo and fresh cut jalapenos.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it.   And the fries are DE-LIC-IOUS.","10/15/2011",0
"Five Guys","I heard great things about this place then read the reviews that weren't so great so I decided to try it for myself. Unfortunately, reviews are right on. The Cajun fries are awesome but the burger is just gross. So bland, boring, and DRY. My dinner just consisted of fries and 3 bites of a tasteless burger. :( disappointing.","11/19/2011",0
"Five Guys","For some reason I prefer the Five Guys at Galleria mall, even though I know that the taste should be the same since it's a chain restaurant. That said, they still serve a pretty tasty burger. It is a tad overpriced for what you get. They don't offer specialty toppings either. Only pickles, tomatoes, lettuce, etc, (i.e. the basics).","6/6/2011",0
"Five Guys","FABULOUS!!!! This was an awesome burger!! The best fast food fries I've ever tasted.","12/7/2011",0
"Five Guys","Five Guys has my favorite fast food burger.  I can tell the ingredients were fresh, and the burgers were really flavorful.  They have peanuts to munch on while you are waiting for your food, which I think is cute.","12/10/2014",0
"Five Guys","I can't believe some of the bad reviews this place gets. The fries aren't crisp, but that's part of the way they cook them. They definitely are tasty. The burgers are always fresh and I like the way they have a crispy bite and juicy middle. I usually never get cheese on my burger, but when I come to Five Guys, I get a cheeseburger and jalepenos, because I love fresh jalepenos. I wish their drink offerings were a little better. Other than that, the service is fast and friendly, and the prices are reasonable. Best burger in Irving.","8/26/2012",0
"Five Guys","I have to say...I'm pretty hard to impress. Analytical, opinionated and all around skeptic. However, my experiences with Five Guys Burgers and Fries have always been a pleasure. I literally cannot remember the last time I have gone into ANY fast food chain and been offered the kind of service that Five Guys offers....especially at this location! This past weekend my husband and I, who ARE NOT big fast foodies, decided to try out this Five Guys and just as we suspected it was AMAZING. Our food was perfect, the service was super friendly and speedy. Not only were we able to sit and chit chat, enjoying a great playlist of phenomenal music, but we were asked literally 6 times by different employees if we would like a refill on our drinks. The employees were pleasant, our food was great and the establishment was super clean. What more can you ask for on a quick Saturday afternoon lunch? Try this location....You'll be glad that you did!","12/22/2010",0
"Five Guys","So..If youre looking for a good ol'fashioned, juicy, greasy, flavor-filled burger/joint then this is not it! Only folks who frequent the fastfood burger places will likely disagree. First, the pressure's on to pick your selections at this build-your-burger chain,as soon as you walk in. Cheap? I dont think so. Most of the toppings are gonna cost you and you can end paying a premiuim price for a mediocre burger. BREAD, MEAT & TOPPINGS are all pretty fresh;  But the key element-MEAT ,lacks the real flavor of a juicy, well seasoned, salt n peppered burger. The FRIES are good but I didnt come here to experience the fries. If the main dish is not good, why would I even care to come back for fries? This place reminds me of Fuddruckers only smaller and crowded (during lunch hour). Dont believe the hype! Burger House, Burger St. & Twisted Root all have better tasting burgers...So no Taste Buds for this place!","4/13/2012",0
"Five Guys","Decent burger, price is too high.  Fries are much too salty and come with way too many fries.  And I'm fat, so it's weird to see me complain about a portion size being too large.  Plan on sharing the fries.","8/10/2012",0
"Five Guys","Not much of a burger person,but when I get a hankerin-I want an old style burger(with all the extras) and fries. 5 guys fills this need-not perfect-fries too limp-good n plenty,but not crispy. Burger,or should I say burgers=2 patties-could actually distinguish the meat from the fixins (all the way plus relish) a handful! Will definitely be back for my next burger fix!","10/2/2022",0
"Five Guys","I was at this location to pick up my order when I was out side of the restaurant I got a call from the restaurant saying that they out of a patty's for them to make my order this really sucks because why would they have the restaurant open if they don't have any meat like seriously","12/18/2022",0
"Five Guys","The last 5 times I've been to a Five Guys in DFW I have had something wrong on my burger. It's always 4 toppings. A1,lettuce,Mayo, and jalapeños. How hard is it to assemble that correctly? Apparently VERY hard. And even after I went in and had my burger redone this time, YES, it was still wrong!! First time had no jalapeños, second time no A1 sauce. 
I honestly don't know why I keep trying. None of the signs in the restaurants say best burger by anywhere in Texas. You go there and the signs are like best burger in FL or NC 1000 miles away. Get it together Texas branch manager. You're the reason everyone here loves Whataburger so much.","4/16/2022",0
"Five Guys","This was my third attempt at giving Five Guys in Mesquite a chance to redeem themselves. Our last two visits were not great but the third one ended up being horrible. I ordered a burger bowl (Keto style burger), I received one piece of lettuce, one tomato, two burger patties and that's all. No other ingredients that I asked for. My husband received a soggy burger with half the ingredients missing. We paid $22 dollars for messy servings and horrible service. I will never go back again.","1/23/2022",1
"Five Guys","I am not one to particularly tear into a restaurant, but when I experience something that was executed so poorly, I have to share.
Hopefully the company will look into the location and turn this negative into a positive.
We are not newbies to 5 Guys and quite frankly we expected friendly service and the  great 5 Guys grilled burgers. But what we got  in reality was burned, cold and a gross excuse for  burgers. The restaurant floors seemed uncleaned, and the staff totally disengaged, but the absolute worst part was overly long wait time and the non- customer service.
We enter the restaurant at 9:15 pm placed our orders and proceed to wait in the lobby where I observed that there were at least five employees and yet at least two -three were  not working and not assisting their team members, within the store at least 7 customers were waiting on orders.
Service was horrible and it took us over 30 minutes to get our food.
And the to add insult to injury, upon checking our order we were sad to see all the food was COLD, and both our burgers as well as the fries were burned, dried and pretty unappetizing.
As we were leaving another customer inquired as to why it was taking so long for her order, her response from an employee was a smirk and callous, uncaring shoulder shrug.
This particular store is not a good representation of the 5 Guys brand nor does it offer the typical positive and courteous experience.
We have seen and had the pleasure of experiencing fantastic 5 Guy locations and unfortunately this location is not one.
Overall this was a much unwanted experience.  I seriously doubt we will ever set foot into this particular five guys ever again.","12/12/2020",1
"Five Guys","This location always a disappointment, I tried this place again , and now they don't have peanuts , when there's a sign that says they have peanuts , I think they lie just so they don't walk to the back smh","10/13/2020",0
"Five Guys","We love Five Guys. Great food and fries. This is a staple of ours for good burgers. We've been so many times. It's not the best but it's up there among other great burger places like Skyrocket Burger, In and Out, BurgerFi and the now defunct Offsite Kitchen. If you haven't been, you'll mostly likely come back. Burgers are doubles and very filling. My wife orders a single burger. The fries are outstanding. Love me some Five Guys.","6/12/2021",0
"Five Guys","Really disappointed in the food here. back home five guys is amazing and has great quality here no quality check fries were unseasoned burgers were labeled wrong and had missing ingredients.","10/6/2020",0
"Five Guys","A joke of a place. Placed and order online 6:10 pm, confirmation receipt stated my order will be ready at 6:21 pm and when I get the restaurant is practically empty. There are 2 hungry souls sitting but other than that no one else was there. I walk in and no one was behind the counter or on the grills. What I do see however, is a white teenage doing pull ups. PULL UPS -___-  hanging from the company's shelf meant to store items. I see 2 African American young guys,one of his phone txt and the other one cheering for the guy doing pull ups. The 4th person was a Hispanic teen sipping on his coke laughing at them. Since I can see all this going on through the little window of their metal door to the back, the Hispanic guy almost chocked and hit the white guy to stop. One of the guys comes out and says you been helped? 
Wow, the phone must be frying his brain cells cause he can clearly see NO ONE was in the front. I pointed to my ticket that had been sitting there for 12 minutes ad he came out from the kitchen at 6:23 pm. He started cooking, more people came in and at 6:33 pm I left with my food. 

While I understand 10 mins is not much to wait... it is when no one, absolutely no one was in the restaurant waiting on their food. Therefore, no reason why I had to wait 20 mins for my food. Defeats the purpose of an online order. I don't get why restaurants have poor hiring processes. Maybe Chick-Fil-A or In-N-Out should give some training to FIVE GUYS hr department and customer service team. $38.00 is not much to spend but I practically paid for a 20 mins wait and a bad experience. Way to go Five Guys, keep up the good work on hiring kids who have no interest in upholding your company values or mission. Or maybe you as as a company don't have any values, mission or vision so I can understand why your staff will reflect that. I absolutely have no need to be back, I rather spend my money on another business than yours. Bye Felicia!","2/5/2019",2
"Five Guys","Tried this place for the first time yesterday. I don't know what all the hype is over these burgers. It was ok, not spectacular to us. The fries were a grease pit and if we would've taken them to go they would have been soggy. It's wayyyyyyy overpriced, I don't think I will be going back. Not worth the money when there are other burger places out there that taste like it and don't cost as much. We order the little burger, little fries, little drink came to almost $14 bucks. No combo meals here. But if you just need to try it out, it's okay for something to try. For me one time is all I needed.","4/1/2019",0
"Five Guys","It's really good I had a good time eating the burger the cheese burger is the best I would recommend five guys to every one it is delicious","10/15/2020",0
"Five Guys","How do you run out of hamburgers patties at 940? An established burger place that runs out of patties is ridiculous! The manager Miguèl Fernandez said they did not prep enough product. He did not sound like a manager and had no answers for my questions. 

And both flat tops where cleaned and turned off! Another customer said the flat tops were already off at 930. (Trying to close 30 minutes early?) 

If they knew they were low on patties, the manager should of called another location for a case of patties to get by for the night.","11/23/2018",1
"Five Guys","Disappointed. Plain and simple. Don't put cheese on a hamburger when it wasn't ordered. Ruined my meal. Usually impressed, but pay attention to detail. Spent $20 on a meal that I had to throw away.","7/4/2020",0
"Five Guys","Great for the price of you want a burger with a lot of customization. You can get a bunch of grilled veggies and fixings for free, but it is a little high for a plain burger. Their fries are always overflowing and everything is delicious.
Avoid if you have a peanut allergy because they have buckets of peanuts in the shell.","7/10/2016",1
"Five Guys","Five Guys is definitely pricey but no doubt worth every bit, I went with my mother for lunch we ordered 2 cheeseburgers, didn't expect to have 2 pattys and 2 slices of cheese on them! We shared a large fry which came in a cup and it seemed like  they added another large fry and dumped it in the bag, I had to dig for our burgers! The fries are cooked in peanut oil which gives it that perfect salty taste and crunchy texture, everything came out perfect. DEFINITELY WORTH THE MONEY!!!!!!","2/26/2018",2
"Five Guys","More employees than customers at 830 on Friday Night,,, guy upfront wasn't welcoming in any way and now that I think of it, he didn't say a word to me.   Luckily, I knew what I wanted to order. 

The burger was unremarkable except for the odd texture.  The fries were the high point, they were great and plenty. 

IMHO, just not good enough, I won't be back.","10/8/2018",0
"Five Guys","Over priced and over hyped. Fast food atmosphere, thin over cooked patties. Doubtful that we'll ever return. For the money we could have gone to Snuffer's and had better burgers and cheese fries.","7/16/2017",1

"Five Guys","I stopped in for a carb-less bacon double cheeseburger and I couldn't have been happier. Great customer service- fast, nice, helpful guys. Really, really delicious burger with extra lettuce just like I asked. Five Guys continues to serve some of the best burgers. Next time I'm in this part of town, I'll be back!","3/1/2019",0
"Five Guys","I remember when Five Guys was good and worth the splurge. Over $16 for a little bacon cheeseburger, fries and a drink. Way overpriced for the grossness you get in your bag. The kids that work here are nice and everything, but the food isnt worth the pricetag anymore. My burger, although edible, I am questioning it. It was cold. My fries tasted like they were deep fried in pinesol. Oh and their soda machine always tastes really bad (this location), similar to their pinesol fries. Not wasting my money on five guys anymore.","4/10/2019",0
"Five Guys","This location always a disappointment, I tried this place again , and now they don't have peanuts , when there's a sign that says they have peanuts , I think they lie just so they don't walk to the back smh","10/13/2020",0
"Five Guys","On the way from one store to another I said to my roommate we could pick up some turkey ham at the next store for dinner and maybe some hamburger patties. She said Ooo I could go for a good hamburger at which point I looked to the right and saw 5 Guys and said let's stop there! After a daring three lane change to get into the drive way we went in to order our burgers. 

As always I have to do mine sans bun because the gluten in the buns would do me in, but the burger bowl was excellent. I do wish these burger places would get up to date and get some GF buns, but then there is the whole prep area issue too. Guess I just need to carry around my own buns just in case I need to stop for a burger. Anyway, it was good in the bowl and the fries were fabulous as always. 

The guy at the counter was very helpful in modifying the burger for my food intolerance.","12/21/2014",0
"Five Guys","I put them to the test! I am a foodie I told the guy taking my order is this burger worth $10 bucks? He said yes. I said first tell me the veggies/bun/Condiments you use on a burger. He said fresh ground beef, Red onions, crisp lettuce, good tomatoes, pile of bacon, and we make our own fries. Everything he named is what I deem needed to make a great bacon cheeseburger. It was worth my $14 bucks it was off the CHAIN!! Yes be careful when you ask for peppers they use fresh not pickled. Get the peppers on the side they are HOT but delicious. I give this burger basket a #10 On my 2nd visit I called ahead it was 5min to closing they held the store open till I got there. Wonderful customer service! Excellent! When you can stand behind your food like that young man did I'm in. The price is worth it trust me.","5/17/2018",1
"Five Guys","We've been coming to this location for a couple years and today was our first disappointing visit, completely due to the lack of fries. When we come here, we're used to getting a nice helping whether we order regular or large fries. At $4.29 for the regular size of what is basically just fried potatoes...a very cheap food staple. We had to go back and ask for more because the fry cup was t even full. As long as we've been coming here, we get an overflowing cupful plus some. Please go back to your normal portion sizes! We're thinking about going to Hat Creek Burgers in the future instead where at least you get what you pay for.","3/31/2018",0
"Five Guys","Food alone was ok  but the customer service is why I decided to score them so low. They were stand offish and very uninviting. Store was dirty even though it was empty. Hard to find a clean table. Food was nothing special especially not to deal with the horrible customer service and dirty restaurant.","2/6/2020",0
"Five Guys","We were just to go order but first timers. She said 10min and I asked for 20 no problem . I walked in the door to clean location and friendly staff for the whole 2minutes I was there. Perfect timing with friendly service. We will be returning. 
The food was actually a good substantial burger. Great quality beef. Thanks for being pleasantly surprising.","1/6/2017",0
"Five Guys","So many places try to over do a burger but this place doesn't. It's perfectly juicy! Little expensive but definitely worth it! It's so filling! These people know how to make a burger!","12/15/2019",0
"Five Guys","My kids have been raving about this place for years.  Today I and She who shall. Ot be denied went in for lunch.  Why oh why have we not gone here before?  The burgers were good but the Cajun Fries were beyond! I could make a meal out of those alone!","11/4/2018",0
"Five Guys","I did not care for this place at all.  First of all, it was loud in this place and the seating is cramped - you're seated pretty much right next to strangers whether you want to be or not.  We started to sit at a 2-person table up against the wall thinking it would be more private, but the air vents up above were blasting COLD air (to the point where you could see napkins moving on the table), that we decided to sit in the middle of the restaurant to stay out of the draft.

As for the food - the burger itself was good but I didn't care for how they throw the fries into a paper bag and there's grease all on outside of the bag and after you're done eating the ones that are in the fries container, you're forced to eat the rest that are sitting in the sack.  Just seems unappetizing to me.  They recently opened up a location closer to home in Rockwall but after this one experience, I have no desire to try them again.","1/6/2013",2
"Five Guys","Man did I get lucky, after waiting some time for an Inn n out to finally come to Tx. my wish came true... Last week while I was searching for the latest info for when they would eventually open, I read an article about Five Guys vs. Inn N Out.... Well after reading it and visiting their website I realized 2 locations had just opened in my side of town. The very next day I took my pregnant g/f to this place hoping she would like it... 
I was taking a great risk seeing as she is prego and could become violent at a moments notice! 

My first impression of the place pulling in is pretty simple, nothing flashy & no drive through which is great... Walked in and got punched in the nostrils by the smell of charred beef! It was amazing... (BTW I did not know about the peanuts until my second trip which was just yesterday....) I looked up at the menu and noticed their wasn't a double so I just ordered the regular Bacon Cheese Burger /grilled onions/lettuce/tomatoes/ mayo & the same for my girl + large Cajun Fries... We got there at just the right time after we sat down the place got packed! Within 10 minutes of arriving they had a line out the door... 

Just about that time our # was called, I walk up to the pick up bar grab my bag and try not to drool while I walk back to my table... So the first thing I tried was the Cajun fries which had a nice little kick to them, after unwrapping our burgers we were a bit surprised to find out that they were doubles... So what I thought was a kids burger is actually a single patty burger, would have been easier to just call it a double? I didn't really care since I devoured my burger in 6 bites! But my g/f could only get about 1/2 put away and I helped her with the other... 

This burger is everything you want in a hamburger/cheeseburger/bacon burger... Juicy, flavorful and cooked over an open fire with great ingredients to boot. What more could you ask for? I mean I know some orange bang and some chili cheese fries would be nice but this place has got it right... The menu is simple and when you don't have to worry about so many options you have time to perfect what you make and let me tell you its perfect!","5/13/2011",1
"Five Guys","Good but overpriced.  Location was clean and service was fast.","6/1/2015",0
"Five Guys","Now I understand the #1 burger ranking in the nation! The one-patty cheese-bacon burger was delicious!!  Neat fries. Chose your drink and grab your peanuts.  It's simple!! The staff are all smiles!! The music is loud and great!! Definitely will return!!","6/8/2017",0
"Five Guys","My husband absolutely loves the food but the last few times we have visited our order has not been correct although the receipt is. I mean if you order a bacon burger you should get bacon. They forgot the peppers and mushrooms the last two times. It's just very frustrating. I mean it's not that hard to read the order when bacon, mushrooms, peppers and onion was the only veggies on the burger. Come on Five Guys...get it together","7/4/2019",0
"Five Guys","This is by far the most visible of higher end burger places in the DFW area (higher end in this case meaning pricier).  There seem to be a lot of them and I just don't ever get drawn into them.  I was in Mesquite and didn't know all the options and this one is very conveniently located so I dropped in.  I ordered the burger and it was what I would expect from Sonic.  Not to knock Sonic they do a great burger for the price, but while this burger was good it was overpriced.  Taste was fine but nothing exceptional, I did like that you could add anything for no additional cost.  Along with my burger I ordered some potato flavored salt.  Some people call these fries but in this case the most prominent ingredient was not potato but salt.  In there defense it did taste like fresh potato salt but if it had had a nutritional info sticker it would have said sodium:  200% of the recommended daily amount. 

Overall this was a average $7 lunch that cost me $13.  The staff were young but helpful and could tell I wasn't a regular.","10/19/2017",0
"Five Guys","Five guys is always great! As far as the service...some guys working thought it would be funny to answer the phone and make farting noises while taking my order. Then when hanging up they called me bro. When I went to pick up my order, the boy at the register wouldn't even look at me. I thought I'd write this review to get the attention of the management here. This is a business and acting in that manner is unacceptable! The staff can either make or break the business and this shows an extreme lack of professionalism as well as respect these boys have for the company they work for. I will not be back to this location!","7/22/2018",1

"Five Guys","The food was okay, bread was a bit soggy for my taste, no napkins out front ( let me say that it was dead only 2 customers)and when I asked for some the girl was not very happy to have to go and get napkins  and lastly It is way too cold in there, I could not eat because I was too cold. I will never be back to that location.","5/17/2017",0

"Five Guys","Excellent burger and fries! They are SOOOOO delicious. Every single french fry was perfect. I'm not exaggerating. And the beef on my cheeseburger was so fresh and tasty, and it went all the way to the edge of my bun - so there were no bites that were only bun or bun and veggies without meat.","3/31/2015",0
"Five Guys","Worst food I've ever eaten. I think Mc Donalds is better and I hate Mc Donalds food.  Bad service. Cold food amd left a bad taste. Prices have gone up to much. 2 burgers and one fry and two drinks ended up being 25 dollars.  Wasn't worth it. Don't eat here.","1/18/2016",1

"Five Guys","Today was my FIRST Five Guys Burger & Fries experience.   I really really liked the 5G Bacon Cheeseburger w/ soft sesame seed bun, L,T,P, Mustard & Mayo.     
I'm just Not a BIG Fan of their Famous Fries.  I don't' like fries w/ the skin on 'em.  Just Don't !   Hubby did like the Cajun Fries.  There's More Than Enough fries in One Order, for 2 people.  

Everything's sold separately.  Burgers, @ $5.30...no chg. for all the fixin's.....fries@ $3.10,  then a Lg. drink...@ $2.30.....Peanuts are FREE ! !   We brought some home for our baby squirrels.    Two people can tear up a $20.   Anyway, the restaurant is very clean, open & bright.  You can see 'em cookin' your burger.   ***DIDN'T see any cooks w/ Flour Hand Prints on the Front or Back (credit card area) of their Black Britches, Thank God!     The counter folks (especially Felicia M. ) were Very friendly.....the burgers were flavorful & cooked perfectly.   I can see 5 Guys being a place I'd take a little league baseball team after the game.   We'll definitely be back!","5/6/2012",2
"Five Guys","Let's start with the positives-the food. Took my sons here just to give it a try. The burgers were great. The boys split a little bacon cheeseburger-and it was actually enough for both of them. I had the bacon burger. The burgers were delicious and very juicy. Really nice flavor. We all split a large order of fries. The fries were great(we went with the cajun) and plentiful-the large really is a large portion. I can see why so many people love their fries. 

Now-on to the rest of the experience. The price-we paid damn near 20 dollars for a two burgers and fries(one of the burgers being their version of a junior burger)and no drinks. The fries were 5.00- I know I mentioned that there were alot of fries but not 5.00 worth. I know that 20 for a sit down meal is not bad but ... wait for it....I would never again come in here for a sit down meal. This place was crazy crowded. People were waiting for tables in the crowded dining area where seating was very tight-close enough that  you had better hope your neighbors have used their deodorant in liberal amounts that day. 

They did have a person patrolling the dining area to try to clean tables- but despite their valiant effort they could not keep up with the constant stream of customers. I can see this being a fun environment if you knew everyone there but this amount of chaos drives me crazy in my old age. 

Will I ever come back? Yes, I will but only to grab a burger to go.","1/4/2011",2
"Five Guys","The bacon (thick slice) cheeseburger was delicious (grilled onions, lettuce, tomato, mayo, and BBQ sauce). Cajun fries were good, well seasoned, thick but limp (I prefer a little crisp to my fry). 
Burger, fry and coke zero = $16
No way I return. There is a Burger Street a block down the road that tastes just as good and costs half as much. And it comes in a tidy Styrofoam container for less mess.","1/4/2011",2
"Five Guys","Burgers and fries are good, but disappointing visit.  I came to the establishment on June 10, a full hour before closing. I tried to get a shake with my meal, but was told they already cleaned the shake machine so they could not make me one.  It was very apparent they were cleaning the whole place a full hour ahead of closing to try and leave the second the establishment closed.  I worked food service as a teenager, and if you advertise that you have food product for sale, then that product should be available until your establishment closes or you run out.  They could have at least lied to me and said it was broken, but they actually told me they already cleaned it and did not want to dirty it by making me one.  Extremely poor customer service, especially for 5 Guys being a pricier burger chain.  I will not be coming back to this location.","6/12/2018",0
"Five Guys","This was my first visit to Five Guys and they hit it out of the ballpark! Speaking from the expertise of a fat guy this burger and fries are a marriage made in heaven. Even the soda machine was enough to put a silly grin on my face! I couldn't believe the plethora of options for all of the popular drinks. I will definitely be going back!","12/7/2015",0
"Five Guys","Once again, I ventured into a new place based on other people singing it's praises, and once again, I walk away utterly disappointed.  Maybe I should just stop listening to everyone else. 

Went online and ordered so that I could actually pick my burger up as soon as I arrived, so I do like that you can do that.  I liked the atmosphere, the manager and crew with their back and forth banter was interesting.  Kind of like the Pike Place Fish of burger places, I guess.  But, I digress.  I got my burger, and it was decent enough sized, and juicy, but the flavor just wasn't there.  Does nobody season their meat any longer?  Very plain.

Fries were okay, and there were A WHOLE LOT of them, but nothing great.

$12 for a burger, fries and a drink.  For that price I expect much better.  Doubt I'll be back.","4/22/2012",1

"Five Guys","Best chain burger, period.  Fries are excellent., too.  Cajun fries, just a step or two behind.  Jr. burgers are plenty, and the regular are giant. Same with the fries.  

Not so good?  Price.  My Jr. Bacon cheese burger, small fries and small drink totaled $11.34. Also, the tables are too close together.  But I can't stay away.","8/13/2012",1
"Five Guys","I love Bacon Cheeseburgers, hands down my favorite food.  Somewhere inside of me there is a fat girl dying to get out.  Five guys bacon cheese burger is awesome, one of the best I have had.  Bacon, melty cheese, beef, i also added jalapenos and grilled onions to mine.  I unwrapped my burger and nearly fainted, they actually used fresh jalapenos and not the jarred/pickled kind.  It makes a world of difference, the flavor, the texture, the color.  I scarfed mine down in record time, it was just too good to wait between bites.

Prices seem to be on par with Twisted root.  Ran me about $21 for two bacon cheeseburgers, two orders of fries and two medium drinks.  Atmosphere is casual, almost retro diner.   This ain't Mickey D's, they do cook to order so don't come in and expect to have your food in 30 seconds.","5/17/2011",0
"Five Guys","I actually like the Five Guys menu.  I love their fresh burgers and Cajun fries.  I wish they had shakes there!  

I did not like this one as much as the Rockwall location though.  Burgers just seemed to not be up to par here at this location, though I am judging this off of one experience which will likely be the lone one.  I will stick with the Rockwall location or others in the city.","7/17/2012",0
"Five Guys","Good food but too expensive for weekday work lunch..looked up menu online..went in to place my order..the instore menu is almost double price of the menu they have posted online..so they need to update. So when I went in I was not prepared to pay almost  $9 for a hot dog and a small fry. Big and very good but expensive.  I told manager the menu online was not correct and asked if she could comp a fountain drink because of the mislead on posted menu prices online..She gave me a  I don't think so grin and handed me a small water cup.    REALLY  just something to laugh about...poor management etiquette.","5/24/2017",0

"Five Guys","SLOW AND EXPENSIVE- I ordered online to save time because I only have 40 minutes to drive from my school, eat, and drive back. Instead of having my food ready at 12:15 like I requested an hour in advance, my food was ready 25 MINUTES LATE. So, in conclusion, if you want to wait forever for an overpriced burger and fries, go to Five Guys at Town East. If not, 

GO SOMEWHERE ELSE","10/21/2015",0
"Five Guys","The Adventure
I greatly enjoyed the 5 Guys throughout the Washington DC area.  So, to my surprise there was one 25 minutes from my home. So, I decided to venture out and give them a try.  I did not want to eat in so I ordered online.  My online order consisted of 2 burgers  with extra lettuce & pickles (plus a few other toppings) and a large order of Cajun fries. 

The Mystery
I received 2 greasy burgers with soggy buns wrapped in foil which the soggy buns could have been from them being wrapped in foil & driven 25 minutes...  As I continue, what seemed to be the core of the lettuce was stacked on one burger and traces of lettuce evidence graced the other. The extra pickles... well I got two pickles on the lettuce core burger and three on the traces of lettuce burger. The other toppings were not memorable and beef lacked flavor.  

Now, the $5 Cajun fries are plentiful... enough to feed 4 people easily, but they really did not have that Cajun spice factor and they were a bit too limp (maybe it was the grease).  Not a good combination.  But hey... you get free peanuts!

The Conclusion
 I am sorry to report this 5 Guys was not worth my 25 minute drive, if I did not live so far I would have returned them.  This 5 Guys is a poor imitation of the 5 Guys up north.  I will not return and I would advise you to keep your $18 or spend it somewhere else.","2/15/2013",0
"Five Guys","My daughter and i ate at Five Guys Burgers last weekend we really liked it !! The cheeseburgers were a perfect size you the meat isnt too thin or too thick and all the veggies were fresh. They made it exactly the way we ordered it unlike most places. I am not big on fries but my daughter said the cajun fries are good although they seemed a little greasy since the ones that ended up in the bottom of the sack left a huge grease stain. Overall i would definatly choose them over burger street who burns the buns and never gets our order correct or mooyah which has tiny tasteless burgers and too much crap to go thru when ordering.","1/27/2015",0

The fries were HUGE but soggy and pretty flavorless.  I tried gallons of ketchup but still couldn't eat more than a few of the greasy bag 'o fries.  Tried it once, won't be twice unless I'm starving and can't make it anywhere else cuz the fuel tank is too low!","8/3/2011",0
"Five Guys","Over priced burgers, the food just dosent have the flavor to justify prices this high. Sad I really wanted to like the concept of this place. I have been there twice. I had to say something on here sence theres such a hype. I go to Scotty P's Burgers in Allen much more worth the price of a $12 burger.","10/21/2013",0
"Five Guys","Great food and service! Super fresh!! Love the atmosphere as well. Don't expect to get the fast food price that some people may seek. A regular burger has 2 patties and a little burger is a single.","12/17/2013",0
"Five Guys","I've heard lots of hype on this place and decided to try it. Right off the bat I realized that I had been misinformed. The cashier greeted us with a jerk of her thumb and we were treated to a festering mess of piercings that all looked very infected. Yuck. Maybe that explains her rude demeanor. I ordered two orders of fries and told me gruffly we didn't need to orders and if wanted more fries to come back and order them after we shared the first order. OK, fair enough, if they are a large order then please just tell me that. Asked a few questions and tried to make nice since it was our first visit. Big mistake, so we tucked tail and head off to the chaos that is their dining area. 
Noisy, cramped and dirty all describe the feeding coral. 
The food you ask?  I'll say the burgers are good. Nothing special but I would rate them on par with Steak and Shake. The fries were god awful. Limp, greasy and luke warm. I now understand why our cashier said not to buy two orders. 
Value here is poor. The food would be overpriced at half of what they charge.
I hear this place compared to In and Out all the time. I have no idea why they aren't even close.  There are lots of reviews from around the country talking about how great the food is here posted all over the store. All i can say is Dallas must be the Burger Capital of the world. We have Burger House, Jakes, Snuffers, Fuddruckers and more that are much better than the mess we encountered at Five Guys Burger and Fries. I don't anticipate this chain to last long in Texas.","1/23/2011",2
"Five Guys","I'm surprised to see all the negativity in the other reviews. Yes, the place is noisy and crowded, so if that bothers you, order it to go. However, the burgers are delicious, and much larger and better quality than usual fast food. We spent $25 for a family of 4 and we couldn't even eat all of our food. I definitely recommend this place and I will be returning!","4/2/2011",1
"Five Guys","Great burger for the $$.  Almost as good as Mighty Fine burgers but not quite...   The thing I love is you get it your way even with mushrooms and grilled onions at no extra charge.   The fries, why  buy two one is enough for two people.","7/2/2011",1
"Five Guys","Great burger joint.  Free peanuts while you wait.  Don't order the large fry unless you reallly love fries or have someone to share them with.  Our large fry fed 3 adults with some leftover after burgers as well.  All burgers come plain and dry unless you ask for cheese and side items.","7/11/2011",1
"Five Guys","The best burger I've tried for a fast food type place. The little hamburger didn't seem little at all. Was plenty to fill me up, especially after you chow down on their delicious fries. My favorite part is being able to order grilled onions and mushrooms as a standard topping!","8/15/2011",1
"Five Guys","My favorite burger place. The best fries in the business. Not overly crisp like some many burger places. I like mine to be a little soft. The burgers are very fresh tasting and you can tell that they care about what they are serving. It is a little expensive when compared to fast food, but this a step or two above the usual fast food fare. Be forewarned though, one order of fries is enough for two or three people.","9/26/2011",0
"Five Guys","Are you serious?

This place is a joke! Come on...any fast food joint is better than this place! Way over priced, burger is bland, and no shakes or malts. You can't open a burger joint in Texas without providing Shakes or Malts. The burger patties are White Castle size and at least 1.2 inch smaller than the bun. For the life of me, I can't see what all the hubbub is about this place. In all honesty, I can't wait till the IN-N-OUT's start opening up here in Texas. 

Families, don't go here unless you intend on spending $10 per person. You are better off doing the dollar menu at any fast food joint. For the price, I would recommend, going accross the stree to BJ's, Black Eyed Pea, Hooters, Sport City, up the street to Braums (great burgers by the way)...heck go next door to Jason's Deli.","1/11/2011",0
"Five Guys","I think this place was great! I loved that the potatoes were from a different place every day, at least it was something different. However, it was a little greasy for me...as well as a little pricy for a burger and fries (they must be very proud).","4/3/2011",0
"Five Guys","Love their Canjun Fries!! Burgers are ok but smaller compared to others.","8/17/2011",0
"Five Guys","This place is awful. Their is nothing good about this place. The burgers are TINY and that's being nice. Everything is WAY over priced. You pay $5 for a tiny thing of fries that is maybe a handful of fries. The burgers are the size of a cheese burger from mcdonalds but you pay 5$. We paid $30 fo 3 burgers a large thing of fries and 3 drinks. RIP OFF.","2/14/2011",0
"Five Guys","I too was hoodwinked by the hype , and as if that weren't enough , once I got inside I noticed dozens of accolade news articles in picture frames - EVERYWHERE , and I mean everywhere ..... It got me thinking - If ya have to toot yer own horn that much ...... Anyway , in my opinion , a lousy dining experience , and the food was nothing to write home about ...... It all tasted good , but the bun on my burger was totally soggy which ruined the burger for me ...... and the price was probably 30% - 40% more than you'd pay at whataburger ........ The music was too loud , which was annoying , and it was hard to hear my number when they called it ...... The music was very annoying to me ....... I gave it 2 stars because I considered the entire dining experience when rating ...... I will give 5 guys one more try in a few days or weeks , and see if they can live up to their hype ....... we'll see","4/20/2011",0
"Five Guys","Two burgers, one order of fries and no drinks cost me over $18.  The burgers were ok, but they weren't made to order.  Ordered a bacon cheeseburger and it had no bacon on it.  Ordered A1 and hot sauce on my other burger and it did not have either one. I could probably over look the missing items if it had been crowded, but it wasn't.  Probably won't go back.","6/7/2012",0
"Five Guys","We went for a late lunch and they were slow which was good. The assistant manager on duty was a complete JERK to the employee who took our order. He has no business managing anyone other than himself. My burger was undercooked and the fries,as stated in other reviews, could stand to be crisper.  The assistant manager had his pants hanging low and had large black earrings in his ears.  Some of the employees with all their piercings in their face could make you lose your appetite.  I'm thinking their corporate office needs to overhaul the dress code here.  If I ever go in again and witness a person in a management position showing his power in front of customers again, I will not eat there PERIOD. The kicker to the whole thing is, after the guy acted like that, he disappeared to the back never to be seen again for the 45 minutes we were there.  SHAME ON FIVE GUYS MANAGEMENT!","5/2/2011",0
"Five Guys","08/31/22- Wednesday @0110

    It's my first time at this location.  Great customer service.  The patty tasted juicy and awesome! The fries tasted good too.  It's a bit pricey.  Spent 20 dollars for a combo.  

 Will definitely return.

"Five Guys","What can I say , I love Five Guys. Their burgers always bring me joy . The fries are great too.
The service is usually friendly and the atmosphere.. well it's a fast food joint so it's fine for what it is. To me they are hard to beat for a good ol' burger and fries.","3/18/2022",1
"Five Guys","This was a really hard one for me to rate. I enjoyed the fried mushrooms and the sautéed onions on the burger and I enjoyed the double patties... but for $11.85 with tip and thinking back at other burgers I've rated fours and fives, this one was probably a little under average in terms of value but average to average plus in terms of flavor. The one star and two star burger rankings go to the chains like McDonalds, Burger King and Carl Jr's.

I think what ultimately I didn't like is that the burger just turned into one big greasy soggy smush burger. The secret to not getting smushy is 1) toasting the bun and 2) keeping soggy greasy things away from the bun. This is why many burger places put their lettuce on the bottom. 

Anyway, I'd go again over any fast food burger place any time, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here.","12/9/2021",1
"Five Guys","Ordered a single patty hamburger, fries, chocolate shake-$20!!!! Waited a long time. Received burger but no shake. Hello?  Young man used machine and handed me a liquid shake. Pointed this out. He said that is the way their shakes are. Huh?? Felt like I was wrong to expect a frozen drink. He went to the back and out came a lady (manager??)
The young man then went to register and the started grabbing cash out of the door and handed it to me. No explanation on liquid shake. No apology. Ok, I can over look that their machine wasn't working. And there is no customer service. But really? No apology? Manager lady said nothing to me. Got home. looked at my order. It was slapped together and slightly falling apart. it was a double meat. Not what I ordered. The fries were ok-not great. $5.00!! Not a good experience at all. Will not return. This was on 6/5/2022 around 3:30 in the afternoon.","6/5/2022",1
"Five Guys","Its been a while since we have been here, but it was good as always.  Love the options to get on the burger and that they offer an option in a bowl that is easy to eat since I cannot eat a bun.  

The fries are some of my favorites.  They are so good.  I could eat them all the time.","11/30/2021",0
"Five Guys","I really wanted to like Five Guys, I've tried to return several times.

They never seem to get the correct condiments on the order, time and time again. And the service is unfriendly, slow, and uncaring.

Oh well...","1/2/2022",0
"Five Guys","The food is decent but the price is OUTRAGEOUS for this type of place. $8.50 for a junior size burger?! Just the burger! That does not include fries. It costed over $50 for our family of five to each get a little cheeseburger and we all shared a large fry and drank water  NEVER AGAIN! We could have eaten at a full service restaurant for that price! I wish we would have just walked out after seeing the menu.","3/1/2022",0
"Five Guys","The place has good burgers, but their prices are horrendous. $43 for two burgers, 1 small fry, 1 regular fry, and one soft drink. That's wayyy too much.","1/28/2022",1
"Five Guys","I usually love this place. I pay about $15.00 for a small burger and fries. The last time I ordered, last week, the quality was not the same. The seasoning was off. The burger tasted like it hadn't been seasoned at all. I was so disappointed. $15 isn't cheap for a small burger and fries...","12/13/2021",0
"Five Guys","As someone who doesn't eat beef, this place barely has any sandwich options. Nonetheless, I had the BLT and it was good.","3/18/2021",1
"Five Guys","Subpar burger and fries. Fries were a greasy mess. Burger was so meh! Small and tasted like salt. Dining area was on the nasty side. Floor could use a good scrubbing. For a small burger, small fries, small drink I paid $17. On the VERY high side on the price. Won't be coming back.","8/8/2021",0
"Five Guys","Visited again, this time with friends for Sunday lunch. Food was still top notch. Service was greatly improved from previous visit. Prices are still on the higher side.","5/16/2021",1
"Five Guys","If I could give this place zero stars I would. I was super unsatisfied with my meal, the cost and customer service. 

After all the praises I have heard about Five Guys, I decided to finally give it a try.

This was my first and probably last time coming here. Perhaps it was just this location, I don't know, but the food was overly priced and not well made, so much so that I have zero desire to ever eat at this chain ever again.

We ordered and waited almost 20 minutes for our number to be called. When we finally inquired as to the status of our food, we were handed our food; it was sitting in a bag on a shelf :-/

We were starving at that point. The food was sloppily prepared. The fries were soggy and overly salty. The beef patty of the burger was the only thing I enjoyed. All the toppings were wilted and soggy, as was the bread. I wish customer service was better. They should have told us our food was ready in a timely fashion. 

I guess there is a first and last time for some experiences in life. Sadly, this is one of them for me.","2/2/2019",4
"Five Guys","Decided to drive the this location. Because Grubhub was going to be double the cost. There was no wait at all. Order took about 15 minutes. Got home and realized they Gave me old and cold food with a smile on there faces. It was 2 hours before they close   So there was no excuse. Now I see why there were no other customers. If you not going take any pride in what you do why do it. There are several jobs you can survive by half assing it. Like standing at an intersection with a sign","1/31/2021",1
"Five Guys","The quality of the food went down Big Time   here..  I remember when you would get fresh fries and a nice fresh greasy burger but the last two times the fries seem like they were cooked and then put them back in the fryer to reheat them and just let them sit under the heat lamp.. in other  words the fries tasted like SH*T!!  and the burger was just blah..dry patties nothing special.. very disappointed with 5 guys.. Well Good Thing for Whataburger","8/1/2021",1
"Five Guys","Last minute dinner decision while down tHe street for a basketball game with the 12 year old. The instant we walked in, the cashier was on when getting our orders. It's like he knew what we wanted before we even knEw what we wanted. My older son, bacon burger plain and dry with fries, my 12 year old (fresh from a game) got a double with cheese and fries. Me, a single with cheese no fries and paw paw got a grilled cheese with fries. We all had Cokes from the cool machine. All the burgers tasted frEsh and just GOOD! Just a tasty burger! 
The fries, cooked and seasoned to perfection and the restaurant clean! Will definitely go to A Five Guys again as it had been yEars since we'd been. 
Only downside was one of the two cool coke machines was out of favorites but the other had what we wanted. And no pepper at the condiment station. Nit picKy things really for  how nice the guys weRe, and how yummy the food was! Great job five guys!","2/10/2020",0
"Five Guys","It's really time to admit that Five Guys is a failed restaurant concept. Couple their overpriced food with overpriced delivery services you can get two mediocre cheeseburgers (one junior) and regular fries for $40! And it takes over an hour to deliver.","7/18/2021",0
"Five Guys","Busted today for a late lunch. Waited at the counter for 10 minutes for someone to take my order. Waved my hand to get someone's attention and they just stared. I was ready to pay 15$ for a greasy burger but they weren't ready for me. Sad. Won't be coming back.","8/21/2021",0
"Five Guys","Let me start off by saying I am never the type to write reviews, but this Five Guys is awesome! The staff are so friendly and the people are very upfront and forward about preparation times which is nice. Food is amazing as always, keep up the good service.","8/1/2021",0
"Five Guys","Just finished half-heartedly eating this disaster of a hamburger. The meat was cold and tasted as though it had been sitting there for an hour. The fries were at least fresh and decent. But the burger was terrible, which is augmented by the unfriendly staff that is behaving with utter ambivalence. The store manager must be a managerial disaster to have this kind of team and product.","11/25/2020",0
"Five Guys","I use to go to Five Guys all the time when I lived in Richmond, VA. This visit at the this location didnt stand up to my expectations. 

First instead of 5 guys/gals there was only One! I asked if she was by herself and she said her manager was in the back and would come up when she was ready...ummm Kay. Mind you there was a line of at least 4 customers not including myself. 

Once the manger decided to come help, our food was ready in a reasonable time. 

The burgers were mediocre, it lacked flavor and seasoning overall, the same with the fries. I will not be coming back to this location","6/1/2017",3
"Five Guys","I'm giving my rating primarily based on the food here. I love the burgers. They're massive, messy, and very well seasoned. Leagues ahead of In n Out or Whataburger. And I say that as a fan of both. All toppings are free too. Including jalapeños. Score. 

Don't even get me started on the french fries. A 'regular' sized order is enough to feed a small country for at least a month, maybe two. I can't imagine how many come in a large order. They literally just dump a ton of fries into the bag, which I'm totally cool with. Well salted, and they're made from fresh cut potatoes not some highly processed yellow cardboard. 

The employees at this location are markedly unfriendly, though it doesn't bother me much. I'm not here to be buddies. I want a burger. Pretty simple. 

Endless free peanuts while you wait and a gargantuan, greasy delight wrapped in tin foil. Your tummy (though probably not your heart) will thank you.","6/28/2017",1

"Five Guys","Two days ago my girlfriend and I was going to try Five Guys for the first time because we were given a gift card. As we walked in, one of the employees looked at the entrance, said f**** (my gf and I both audibly heard), and she ran to the back of the restaurant behind a door. 
The only other person who was in the front was cleaning the back of the fryer and he didn't see us. We just stood there confused and we could see the girl along with someone else peering through the window of the door she ran through.
I'd like to mention that people were in the restaurant still and we showed up at exactly an hour and 20min before they closed.
In the end we got the attention of the man cleaning the fryer but he was clearly annoyed we were there, so we just left the restaurant. 
After this experience we never wanted to go to another Five Guys again. we ended up driving to In-n-Out.","9/23/2020",0

"Five Guys","I have no idea what happened to this location. The employees are rude! They got my order wrong and instead of apologizing she's like hand me the receipt and the bag, I'll remake it. The fresh wrong order we received was COLD. The food was cold and the cheese wasn't even melted. I had to explain my order again in which she wrote down incorrectly once more. We decided to leave and get our money back. She rolled her eyes and proceeded to deduct $2 from the return total. Yeah we will NEVER come back.","4/26/2019",0
"Five Guys","I frequently visit this Five Guys location for lunch. It's never very busy and always clean. I get the bunless a burger in a bowl and they always accommodate my special requests for extra pickles and extra grilled mushrooms with no extra charge. It always comes out the same and it's always good. 
While I wait for my to-go order I'll snack on peanuts which is always good because I'm usually starving when I stop by. 

This is a great place to stop if you are in the Keto diet.","5/30/2018",9
"Five Guys","Just ok is my bottom line on this location. Don't get me wrong, the five guys burger is hard to beat. However I have found that if the kitchen crew isn't taking assembly of the product seriously ... Well it's just not as appealing. Over the last couple of years their jiggling of the offerings; i.e. Big burger, little burger etc has diluted their performance. I once read where the owner that developed the concept was strict in his beliefs about the menue. Hence no shakes!  Really you can't make s shake because it may throw the  Guys off but you can add all sizes of other things. This does not compute.  He's off somewhere on his yacht anyway and has probable lost interest. By the way is it just me or have there formerly reasonable prices jumped?
Thank goodness whataburger is still around to save the day will a reasonably priced and delicious meal for what a single burger at 2 guys goes for.","9/1/2016",1
"Five Guys","I do not get it.  Mini (single burger) is tiny, regular (double) is expensive.

No onions rings, no cheese selections, not much to chose.

Called order in, called three times no answer.  At 2pm, huh.

Went there, waited 5 min for someone to come out.  

MOOYAH BURGERS.....ten times better.","2/3/2020",0
"Five Guys","We ordered my burger with mustard, no ketchup and it was slathered in ketchup and had absolutely NO mustard on it. The receipt even said Mustard but no such luck. It was pretty much ruined. I scraped the ketchup off as best I could, but it was on the top AND bottom of the burger and absorbed into the buns. Even the large amount of mustard I put on didn't mask the taste of the ketchup. I called to let them know that someone on the cook line wasn't being careful and they needed to be. The young lady who answered apologized and said it would be better the next time we came in, but I don't think we'll ever be back.","3/6/2019",0
"Five Guys","It's unfortunate that places go downhill over time. I stopped about an hour ago and picked up a regular  fry and a large drink to go. 

When I got to my destination the bag was soaked through with grease since the fries were not properly drained. It got all over my car. The fries are usually krispy and awesome. These were soggy and limp.

When I opened the bag, there were less fries than I usually get in a little order. 

I don't know if it's complacency or insufficient training, but two experiences like that and there will be no reason to ever go back.","11/3/2017",2
"Five Guys","The expensive burger places are getting more competitive.  This Five Guys is going in the wrong direction.  Curbside pickup was offered on-line, but not implemented.  Had to go inside.  Several customers were frustrated because of wait times.  Many customers were congregated around the order pickup station.  Service was chaotic.  Burgers were good.  Fries were cold by the time we received them.  My 10 year old said I like McDonalds about the same and it is cheaper.  He was right.  Our bill for 4 small burgers and 2 regular fries was $52.   We will go to Liberty Burger, Burger Fi, or Mooyah next time.","8/10/2020",1
"Five Guys","I've been a fan of Five Guys for years-way before they could be found on almost every street corner.  Unfortunately, success has not been kind to them.  The burger being put out now is a far cry from the original.  Everything just seems to be thrown together with little thought to presentation and the quality has taken a hit, while the price has increased markedly.  

The Plano/Carrollton location is no exception.  Service is very slow-usually because only a couple people working.  Tables seldom cleaned.  Food seems to be greasier than normal and lacking in taste.  You're probably better off at Sonic across the street for half the price if you are ok with a mediocre burger.","6/6/2017",4
"Five Guys","If this was the first Five Guys I'd ever been to I wouldn't come back. There's 2 employees working both of which are doing so so slowly that nobody has any food. The woman who seems to be the manager is soaking wet and sweating all over the food. Upon being asked to refill the ketchup machine by a customer (after 20 minutes of no ketchup) she said if you ask me again I'm going to have a breakdown. Completely unprofessional, makes Five Guys look like a joke.

Edit: the fries were not seasoned and tasted like cardboard, definitely not five guys quality","7/27/2017",2
"Five Guys","Go to Whataburger!! 

I really like the food and and would like to come here more often but - man o man - if you try to order anything too complicated like a CB with mustard, no mayo, and no onions - you better eat it there because the Einstein's that take the orders and cook and pack the orders can't handle all that complicated stuff. You'll be taking it back to the counter to get it fixed. This particular sandwich came with onions and mayo no mustard. You get the idea.

I made a real mistake and tried to order 4 CB's and a HB for my Saturday crew. I took the time to go over it 4x when I ordered it. And on their ticket they had it input right , but each sandwich has a number sticker 1-5 on it which is supposed to correlate to the ticket order -- lol forget it.
Numbers wrong, toppings wrong, you name it. Total screw up. Don't bother. Just order a cb and say surprise me.

3 stars based on lack of service , which I did not go into , and screwing up my teams' order.","6/9/2018",0
"Five Guys","We just moved here and thought we'd dine at all the restaurants in this area.  We started with Five Guys and we've never been here before.  The place was clean and the guy at the register friendly.  The burgers are definitely huge, the mini burgers are prob more the usual size.  The big burgers were $8.  The three of us totaled $38 and I cannot honestly say that cost=food.","7/21/2017",1
"Five Guys","Crowded as hell when we got here (around 12:30 Sunday), and the Five Guys crew still managed to bust out 4 fantastic burgers and an order of fries in a respectable amount of time.

My burger had fresh toppings, was put together well and delicious. The fries here are excellent, and they always give you more than what the container holds. The condiment area was well stocked and clean.

The workers were polite. The store was pretty clean considering the crowd. Short wait for tables, long line for soda as one of the coke machines was busted.","12/13/2016",2
"Five Guys","I walked in to place an order last night at 9:30pm. There was one person behind the grill. She asked me to wait a minute. Not sure what she was doing, seemed like she was just standing there.
A couple minutes go by, she turns to me and says,  we're out of paddies. I said what? And she repeated, we're out of paddies. 
How in the world is a hamburger joint out of burgers.
I didn't believe her. I looked. The floors were a mess behind there. Nobody had cleaned up. It wasn't that crowded in there. I wasn't sure if she was lying to me, lazy or both. I'll never go back even though I live around the corner. That place was disgusting. I promise to spread the word too.
By the way, how did she know I wanted a burger? I didn't even order yet.","4/8/2019",1
"Five Guys","So slow!!! They literally drip sweat in the food. One guy wiped his nose with his gloves on, then proceeded to prepare food. Gross, I canceled my whole order. Five Guys invest in some fans for your employees. Train these people on handling food.","6/30/2019",0
"Five Guys","The staff was extremely nice ! I've been here twice and both times have been highly impressed. This last time I was with my wife and son. Two things really impressed me. 
(1) We ordered and got to drinks. My wife and I ordered large drinks and then a small for my son to put into his sippy cup. The girl at the register noticed my wife holding his cup and very nicely said, Are you just pouring it into his cup? My wife said Yes and she said, Oh! Your good! You don't need to buy a drink just for that! Wow. Rarely, and for me never, experienced this.
(2) They actually have CHANGING tables in both Male and Female restrooms! Quiet a few restaurants either don't install them or only have them in the female restroom (sexiest?). 
The food was exceptional! 
Five Guys fans for life !","12/20/2014",1
"Five Guys","I have eaten @ Five Guys all over the place and this was the first time that the burger was mediocre @ best. The french fries were $6 and were supposed to feed 3 or 4 and we counted the fries and there were only 46 fries. I complained and they said that was the right amount. I will never go to another Five Guys again!","8/23/2018",1
"Five Guys","First visit at this location as we usually visit the one closer to home.  Burgers cooked as ordered so hot off grill.  Bun was soggy but still OK.  Prompt service.","2/22/2015",0
"Five Guys","I like the burger here, but am always shocked at the price and left wishing I would have gone somewhere better for the same amount or less. They rob you with fries and a drink, which ADDS nearly $7 per person JUST for something that should already be included. Come on... it's good but not THAT good. 

This location needs to improve with cleanliness. All of the surfaces were sticky in the bathroom, literally everything dirty, AND the soap dispenser was empty so I couldn't even wash my hands after having to touch it all. I had to walk to another business nearby to wash my hands.

SO done with this place!","10/16/2016",1
"Five Guys","Forget placing a complicated order. Also forget ordering 2 different sizes of something...it just confuses them. And then they will argue with the customer, make sure they have the last word. The only reason they got 2 stars is because the food's actually pretty good. The only redeeming, and very sweet, employee is crystal. She always has a smile for the customers.

Even in NY state, the customer service was better.","10/31/2018",1
"Five Guys","Always terrible service. 5 associates and 1 customer (myself). No one said hello, have a nice day, come back, etc. Waited about 10 mins for burger. It's obvious the employees hate working here. Maybe they should do everyone a favor and just go home.","6/24/2018",1

"Five Guys","These guys used to dish up great hamburgers and super fresh fries   That made it worth paying the premium for a great burger.

Went last night to pick up an online order, nothing fancy just basics.  Order confirmation email said the order would be ready in 8 minutes.

Got there and it was complete chaos behind the counter.  

As I walked in in the middle of the dinner hour, two employees left leaving one working the counter, one flipping burgers and one working fries.  And it seemed like no one knew what they were doing.

After arriving to pick up an order that was supposed to be ready 5 minutes before I arrived I had to wait 30 minutes for my order.  And the food was nowhere near the quality it used to be.

Going to Whataburger from now on.","10/27/2018",1
"Five Guys","Picked up a door dash delivery here, staff never even greeted me even after i've been standing at the register, walked right past a manager (conducting an interview lol)","3/30/2019",0
"Five Guys","I tried five guys for 1st time due to hearing they were voted best fries - what a mistake! First, the atmosphere inside the restaurant is totally non-existent and very depressing. Cheap tables and chairs, dirty looking for and commercial trash cans & literally no decorations on the wall. 
You had to add on fries & a large soda is over $3 for the stupid Coke freestyle machine, which is incredibly overpriced. 
I ordered a little hamburger & little Cajun fries excited about trying the fries that were voted so good. I wasn't asked whether my food was to-go or not, so it was delivered in a to-go paper sack - I think all their food is since they didn't appear to have trays. 
The fries were terrible! They tasted soggy versus crispy and crunchy. The burger was average, but nothing to really distinguish it from any other place. 
The price, lack of any atmosphere and poor taste make this a huge disappointment! I do not recommend!","10/29/2019",0
"Five Guys","My stomach was screaming saying feed me & the first thing that came to my mind was BURGER! I've been here a few times and really never been disappointed which is a great thing. I got the bacon cheeseburger with Cajun fries, that had just the right amount of seasoning and grease. Plus one of the perks is that they have the drink machine with endless possibilities: lime Coke for me.  If you're in the area and want a burger STOP HERE promise you'll be satisfied.","1/2/2016",1
"Five Guys","Not much to be said about this place. They have a simple menu and they do it well. The service is always good. The burgers are always good. The fries are hit or miss (try the cajun fries). 

This place is clean and the food comes out fast. The only drawback is that it can be a little on the pricey side for burgers, but it's worth it every now and then.","4/21/2014",0
"Five Guys","Very disappointed . Have been here 3 times and am done with it. Food and service are inferior compared to the one in Lewisville. Twice now we've gotten double burgers after ordering singles. The bun and lettuce were beyond soggy. Fries mushy. Service painfully slow.","10/23/2019",0
"Five Guys","Food is what you would expect. Just a burger place. This particular location however is incredibly slow. It took 30 minutes to get one burger. Maybe if the employee behind the counter wasn't on her phone...","12/8/2019",0
"Five Guys","Not the best in DFW but top 10 for sure. There is never a problem getting in and I have found the staff at every location I have visited to be very nice and friendly.
I also like their hotdogs. I wish their fries were as outstanding as the burgers and hotdogs but they are pretty standard. Though the Cajun fries have a spicy rub that makes them better.
The atmosphere is comfy. Not fast food but the food comes out pretty fast!","1/17/2014",0
"Five Guys","Let me start by saying I do not eat red meat...so my review is not based on the burgers. I ordered the grilled cheese and regular fries. The sandwich was just ok. But the fries were soooooo good!  I wish they offered turkey burgers or chicken sandwiches to attract different customers but I get it--it's not their thing. 
Everyone was super nice and very helpful. I wouldn't mind returning with my husband, since he does eat burgers. I would probably just get the fries though.","4/9/2014",0
"Five Guys","The cashier charged me twice for my soft drink ($2.59) and cashed it out before she caught it. So the mgr came over and asked for my debit card again... He says the credit should show up in 5 days. Not cool.","7/1/2015",1
"Five Guys","It never okay to have a animal in a restaurant and gave them a pan to put water in and they sat the dog on the table. That is a health violation.","8/21/2018",0
"Five Guys","Man has this place gone downhill
Greased buns  bad mushrooms poor meat quality
Will never return","3/14/2017",2
"Five Guys","Food was solid... but staff was almost comically unfriendly. One employee in particular (the one in the picture) was either doing her best impression of Melissa McCarthy.. doing her impression of Sean Spicer.. or she was the most disgruntled, disrespectful service industry employee I've personally ever encountered. It was so over the top that I actually would say it lead to a fun experience. Gave us all something to talk about at lunch.. and the people watching was great (with everyone's reaction to her as she yelled their number in pure anger.) The only thing I can compare it to is when you go to a dumpy dinner at 3am and the 85 year old waitress acts like she is annoyed that you expect her to actually wait on you. If she is doing it on purpose.. she is a brilliant performer.... otherwise I'm not sure she will have her job much longer. (If management cares)","6/22/2017",1
"Five Guys","I have to start by saying I used to eat at the Five Guys galleria once a week and loved it. This place let me down. Somehow my meal was $15+ for a burger, fries and a drink. I think for half the price I would go to In-n-Out or Whataburger. The burger was OK at this location but fries were soggy and the bun crumbled after the second bite.","11/29/2016",2
"Five Guys","We stopped for burgers and fries after shopping at Willow Bend Mall. This restaurant is in a VERY NICE area of Plano Tx. We had my 81 year old mother with us and none of us eat burgers and fries on a regular basis but she requested a burger.

First thing, none of us had EVER Been to a Five Guys, but it was highly rated on Yelp.

it was 2;45 PM and the shop was not overly clean. The floors were sopping wet and a Slip and Fall Hazard, especially with Senior Citizens. The staff had parked Wet Floor signs (which are also Slip and Fall Hazards) all over the floor area where you walk to the tables and the drink counter and condiment counter.

We ordered and since they proudly display signs that the fries are cooked in peanut oil (which is VERY BAD for most people), and is a low quality Omega 6 saturated oil, we opted for burgers and beverages only.

The burgers were finally served in a to go bag, no one in my group said anything about a to go order. We asked for trays and they just looked at us. There were no lemons, fresh or fake for the tea.

The soda were so watered down with carbon. water that the sodas were undrinkable.

The burgers were served very sloppy and oily. This was our first and last visit to a Five Guys and if there were a Zero Stars, that is what I would rate this restaurant.

I went online and complained to Corporate and their disingenuous response was, Thank you for this Learning Opportunity. Wow, where did they buy all the Fake Awards posted around all the windows and walls of the Restaurant. Just WOW!

This place sucks. Food sucks. Service sucks. What a total waste of our time and what an awful experience.","7/5/2018",0
"Five Guys","I stopped at Five Guys because it was next door to the chiropractor, to grab a quick lunch to go and head back to work.  I ordered the double cheeseburger with mayo, onion, pickles and mushrooms.  I was a little disappointed with the lack of options for customization.  No different buns, no ranch, no thousand island, no cheese other than cheddar.  Over $10 for a burger and small fries seemed pricy to me for what I was getting, when I can get the same (and better) at In-and-Out for $6.  For $10 I expect a lot more options.  The employees here seemed nice and I have no complaints about customer service.

It took a little while to get my order, maybe comparable to In-and-Out Burger's wait.  The fries were piping hot and I burned myself eating them on the way back to work (my fault, not theirs!)  The fries were greasy and average tasting.  Burger was wrapped up in foil, which kept it hot 20 minutes later and the cheese was nice and melty.  It was a good burger overall, but I couldn't help feeling like something was missing.","7/29/2015",0
"Five Guys","People are funny. 
There's no for here or to go; they package the same either way. It's a streamlined business model with all the extras cut out for good reason. 
The burger is always tasty, the cajun fries are good and plentiful, and the staff has been friendly and courteous every time I've visited. Bonus points for the free peanuts!","4/16/2015",1
"Five Guys","1 Star for slow service.  Have t tried the food yet, but not busy in here and pick up order is 15 minutes late.","2/9/2019",1
"Five Guys","Soda machine was not working. I was the only person ordering and my order was taken wrong. The order was not even made correctly to match the tag. The burger was dry.","7/18/2016",3
"Five Guys","Burgers are always fantastic. It's hit and miss with the fries. Sometimes there's way too much salt on them. Other than that, I could eat here almost everyday!","8/23/2016",1
"Five Guys","$11.24 for an sub-par burger and a Coke. Bread that crumbled by 2nd bite. Service (Ricky T) too lazy to be bothered with asking for here or to go? Mayo when I ordered mustard. In-and-Out beats these guys at half the price!","5/27/2016",2
"Five Guys","If I could give one rating for food taste and one for customer service I would.  Food is good.  The staff at this particular location are RUDE.  The last time I went in I had placed an order online and paid online.  The ice machine was leaking I guess because the entire floor had standing water.  No warning sign or anything put up.  There was no one at the pick up area so I asked someone behind the counter where do i pick up my online order I already paid for? She said you have to get in line.  So i got in line behind 7 people.  Stood there all that time.  Got up to the counter and said i had an online order and she said did you pay online? I said yes.  She said then you don't need to be over here you needed to go over there.  So I walked over to the pick up area which was unattended.  Those behind the counter saw me.  They ignored me.  Finally I just said out loud CAN I GET THE ORDER I PLACED ON LINE PLEASE?  One of them stopped what they were doing, walked over and grabbed the bag that had been sitting there since I walked in and slid it across the counter without a word.","5/30/2019",0
"Five Guys","Great burgers but slow staff who won't even double check with your order when waiting over 30 mins and see you waiting but the food was good I will admit!","7/4/2019",0
"Five Guys","I usually love five guys burgers. This location is the worst!!! Walked in and was not greeted for about 3-5 minutes I actually was telling my boyfriend let's just go and finally someone walked up. We ordered 2 burgers, fries and two drinks number 61. There are about (counting the people outside) 10 people in the whole restaurant. We go to get drinks one machine is out of order and the other one is out of everything. Most people are standing bc there are no clean tables to sit at. Then we hear number 55 are you kidding!! 25 minutes now and we have not made it to 56. I will not be back!!!!!!","3/17/2019",0
"Five Guys","My husband and I brought our grandsons here for dinner tonight.  The place was filthy, none of the tables were clean and the bathroom was the dirtiest I've ever seen. We won't be coming","2/26/2016",2
"Five Guys","Send $17 on an online pickup order to be ready at 8:58 pm and my 1 cheeseburger fries and shake were ready at... 9:24pm.  If I would have know any body these staff members had to help 1hr tell close was unwanted, I would have gone 3 doors down to the big orange W place and saved $7 on my dinner. To have had my wife ask my if everything was ok because I was eyeball all the way back to my Truck by all 3 staff members was shocking.  
I thought I would have been greated freindly.  As the  restaurant only had two other patrons when I walked in. Getting more of a look of really and its closing time.  Was vary unexpected. I can make a lot of assumptions and prediction on why customers are treated this way an hour before closing. But that really does not matter, people choose every day on how they will respond and/or treat others.  
The thing that I hate the most about this is I love the food and instore atmosphere. The reviews of this store are telling Ill need to drive to another 5 Guys or go somewear customers are valued as people that work hard for the money it takes to enjoy your establishment.","4/18/2019",0
"Five Guys","Good overpriced burger, little and regular fries were the same amount with a dollar difference in price, asked for eat in order, was served to go. My order consisted of three separate bags with the meals mixed up randomly. First and last time. Was just curious about this place...","4/13/2016",1
"Five Guys","Just had the most tasteless, boring, over priced burger in Dallas.  What happened Five Guys, when you first opened, you were good?  Never be back... blah :(","8/12/2015",2
"Five Guys","After messaging with Matt B. We realized that we were there on the same day 9/25 & both had a similar experience with the same employee. I was also asked if I believe in god which I honestly was offended by but I was so shocked so I answered not that it's yours or anyone else's business no I don't. I was also told if I don't get right with god I will be going to hell. He said this in front of my daughter which is just beyond offensive. I go to or to be more accurate went to 5 Guys because I never will again for one reason to eat not to be judged by someone who doesn't know my life & my struggle as a widowed mother of 2.","10/11/2016",0
"Five Guys","I went to eat lunch at Five Guys I order my food the guy at the register told me the price I gave him a 20 he gave me change back from a 10 I told him that I gave him a 20 he said I didn't so I guess the other guy was the manager they was going to count the register so when they open the register he had put my 20 under10 so they didn't have to count the register the guy was trying to cheat me out of my money I would never go back there again","5/19/2017",1
"Five Guys","Music way too loud. Good music choice, just too loud. No reason to be this loud while trying to eat, this isn't a dance club.","1/27/2018",0
"Five Guys","Such rude and terrible service! So disappointing!!!! I have come to this location so many times and I have never received such awful customer service. The lady at the register took my order with such attitude as if she was not already an employee there. When I asked for more whipped cream on my milkshake she proceeded to roll her eyes at me and refused to do so. After multiple attempts she just walked to the back without saying a word and came back a few minutes later finally acknowledging my request. She still would not stop rolling her eyes at me or giving me nasty looks. When my order was finally ready after what seemed like an eternity it was as if I ordered a kids portion. My order was so small and not the size it usually comes. My boyfriend then proceeded to complain to the manager (who still did not do much) while the rude cashier lady immediately ran to the back. Overall terrible experience at a place I used to thoroughly enjoy eating at. Sad to say my last visit was the worst of all time.","8/27/2019",0
"Five Guys","We were on a work trip and the rest of the group were in a hurry and decided to stop at Five Guys, which I had never eaten at before, and get carryout on the way back to the hotel. When I got back to my room, I found they had mixed up my order with someone else in the group and they had already dug in. They had ordered a mixture of toppings which I personally found disgusting and because they used chopped lettuce (which  am not against), I could not pick off the toppings. I had to scrape it all off of the meat and ended up tossing it with the bun. The fries rubbery and incredibly very greasy because they were under cooked. They got tossed too. I had missed lunch because of the busy day, my dinner was a single grilled meat patty. A complete waste of money. Oh and since I was traveling on business, I could not expense a second meal. Needless to say, I went to bed hungry.","3/29/2018",0
"Five Guys","The burger was good and we ordered a regular fires which was too much for two people but no Complaints. My problem was with how long we waited the restaurant was fairly empty only a few people. Yet it took almost 25 minutes to get our food. I thought that was quite a long time for two burgers and fries.","7/25/2015",0
"Five Guys","Average burger. Overpriced. Not bad just nothing to set it apart. I'm not sure if I could tell the difference between Five Guys and Mooyah if you put them side by side.

Clean place with a friendly staff.","5/4/2012",1
"Five Guys","This is a sub-par Five Guys franchise.  The fries were a little soggy.  Not the crispy variety I'm used to at other Five Guys.  The cashier asked us if we believe God.  Not appropriate for him to be proselytizing while he's on the job.","8/25/2016",2
"Five Guys","I've always thought Five Guy's strength was their fries more than their burgers. But the burgers are pretty good, and all the toppings are free. Freshly cooked & made to order, can't complain. The fries are extremely good and portions are very generous. I especially like the fries with potato skin on them, you can tell they are very fresh fries from potatoes. No problems, will visit again.","5/23/2015",0
"Five Guys","It was a slow Sunday night, ordered at 7:43pm, FINALLY received our order at 8:21pm??  It was 2 burgers and an order of fries!??  We checked on it too!   Very Very Slow service.   Cannot imagine how long the wait would be on peak times.","10/29/2017",0

"Five Guys","Disappointed to the Fullest! I waited so long to come and try this AMAZING burger... Finally the day came and order a little bacon cheeseburger with cajun fries! Gotta say fries were the star! The burger had no flavor it was just BLA!... The bacon was so toasty (burn) , the onions were cut inconsistent plus they didn't get my order right! Got no tomatoes, no ketchup and a TON of mustard. Gotta say i rather eat at Whataburger! The employees there were being unprofessional. Waited 30min for the worst burger i ever tried! I will not be coming back!","12/6/2015",3
"Five Guys","What kills me is they say they are the best. I will say it's great but not the best. I have had 3 other burgers that are head and shoulders above it. I guess it is all in the preference of the person eating it. I will say that all the veggies on the burger are great quality and that is a big deal with burger places.","4/3/2015",0
"Five Guys","There is nothing special about the burgers and fries. It is just an ordinary any one can cook at home burger and fries. The peanuts  and coke machine was the only thing that made this burger house stand out. The staff and manager was very good and caring.","11/18/2013",2
"Five Guys","A limited menu burgers, fries & hot dogs.  The burgers are cooked to order so they are always hot.  Great toppings are available for free.  They cook the fries in peanut oil and they are not shy in giving you plenty of fries no matter the size you order.  I also love the roasted peanuts to nibble on while waiting for the burger to be cooked.","1/19/2015",0
"Five Guys","The burgers are ok. they could definitely use some seasoning and their patties. But the fries are amazing!","4/30/2015",0
"Five Guys","I went to five guys in Addison a few years ago and it was awesome.  So, I took some friends to the Five Guys at 3400 Hebron in Carrollton.   Worst dining experience I think I've ever had.  I don't know if there was a person with the title manager but there was no one there managing the store.   There were 8 tables with customers and 6 employees behind the counter.   Average of 3 people per table.  So roughly 1 employee for every four customers.  You'd think with that ratio things would be flawless.   Every table in the restaurant was filthy.  No one was cleaning tables after customers left (apparently all day).  So, you had to find some napkins and clean your own table with a dry napkin.   It was 7 pm and the sun was blinding.  They have shades for the windows which a competent manager would have closed when the afternoon sun started coming in through the windows.   Several tables were complaining about the sun so we closed the shades in area ourselves.   It took 20 minutes to prepare 2 burgers and a single order of fries.   The guy that calls out your number couldn't be heard unless you stood on top of him.   They gave our order to the wrong customer.  Who took it to his table.  Removed everything from the bag (touching all of our food) and then realized it wasn't his order.  He took the bag back to the counter where they gave him his order and then called our number to give us the food the stranger just handled (very sanitary).   When we picked up our food our shakes were not prepared.  The guy said you had to go to a different guy and ask him to prepare your shakes.  Paying for them and having them on a ticket wasn't how they prepared them.  You had to go make a formal request that someone please please make the shakes you paid for and give them to you.   When they did prepare the shakes they looked more like milk and chocolate milk than a shake.  The fries we received were very soggy (probably because multiple people handled them).   To summarize: Store was filthy, no management or organization present, very unsanitary, food was awful, and service was no where to be found.   I do not blame the employees who were there.  It was obvious they were trying to do the best job they could.  They simply lacked training and management.   The store should be avoided at all cost.","5/13/2018",0
"Five Guys","Ordered four burgers and fries on line through Post Mates yesterday.  When received the food, we quickly realized they all had mushrooms, mayo, mustard, and ketchup in addition to everything else.  I had ordered them all the way.  I called the store just to verify if their version came this way, and the answer was yes.  Ok, no problem, I screwed up.  then we realized that none of them had jalapenos (like I ordered on one) and the kid cheeseburger with bacon, had no bacon.  I thought about it for a second and decided to call back.  Not to complain but to make them aware that they have orders going out wrong.  The woman answering the phone said, Are you the lady that just called?, in a irritated tone.  I said, Yes, but I'm not calling about that, I messed that up and I know that.  I told her that the order was still wrong and the next thing she did was sigh heavily in the phone and with a real nasty tone she said, you've already got your order, what do you want me to do about it!?  I simply said, Nothing, but I will tell you now that you are a rude person.  She hung up on me.  I understand people aren't happy in their jobs, I understand she probably had a lot of unhappy people with screwed up orders to deal with.  What I don't understand is an employer wanting to keep their business, hiring people like that to represent them.","2/25/2019",0
"Five Guys","I have been trying the more local non-chain places but my wife and I always come back to 5 guys as the standard for a great burger. Tight wrapped in foil to keep everything together and hot, 2 good! Cajun fries are pretty good and you always get a ton of em but man the burger is just great tasting every time.","6/12/2014",0
"Five Guys","I am comparing this five guys to the other ones I have been too. The taste was on par with the other ones, but have to knock off a star because they were not very generous with the fries like the other five guys I have been too. I am used to getting a good portion of fries in my bag, but when I looked in my bag nada??!! Staff was friendly and nice but what gives with the rationing of fries. The other locations have no problem with making me feel like I am getting hooked up.","5/12/2013",2
"Five Guys","I've been here a few times and the burgers are probably top 3 for a chain burger joint.  My only complaint would be the price, they are proud of their burgers!  The staff at this location is very friendly.  I always get the double cheeseburger w/ cajun fries.  If you like a little spice definitely go with the cajun fries.","6/11/2014",0
"Five Guys","Minus one star for limp fries. Expensive burger joint. Service was excellent. Presentation of burgers was lousy. Barely wrapped in a piece of foil, my burger fell apart upon retrieval from bag- we did dine in.    Fries appeared to be dumped in the bag. Burgers were good. Jalapeños were fresh -not pickled and the rest of the free toppings earned one of the stars. Not impressed. They do have charging stations for electric cars.","6/26/2014",0

"Five Guys","So I'm real picky about onions on my burgers....i like them freshly grilled not grilled and sitting in a tub of oil/butter for hour ........kind of like an oklahoma onion burger but that doesn't seem to exist here in the DFW...so i made a request when I ordered to have my onions done a certain way and it was after lunch rush so I didnt' think it would be a big deal....while waiting on my order the manager made a point to come out and make sure I got them like i asked which i thought was nice....he knew exactly why I asked for them that way ..the guy that took my order...not so much........rookie hamburger dude who probably just graduated from Mcdonalds to here........they got cajun fries by request.....I'm a fan I'll be back but so many other burger joints to conquer.....they got that fancy soft drink dispenser where u can get any drink flavored with cherry or whatever........","10/25/2013",0
"Five Guys","Good burger value. Attentive staff and great on customer service. This would be your burger joint if you are too lazy to make your own. Lower than Burger Lounge, higher than In'n Out. Peanuts are a nice touch, kids go crazy about that.","10/20/2013",0
"Five Guys","I'm really surprised about the bad reviews. I'm very picky when it comes to a burger and the first time I had one here I came back three times in a week and I never do that. I'm not sure how people are ordering their burgers and one person even claimed there's a lack of customization LOL. There's a list of ingredients and they're all free. I order the little cheeseburger with double cheese, extra pickles, lettuce and grilled onions with mayo and ketchup. It's so tasty and so are the fries.","4/2/2016",0

1)  tried different styles of burgers, everyone complemented the beef - tender with flavor.  Fries were very tasty!

Burgers were delicious. Cajun fries are extra seasoned. 
havent had a milkshake yet.","8/7/2022",0
"Five Guys","For a place that appears kind of beat down and ratchet, the burgers are Q U A L I T Y. The meat is well cooked, their unlimited toppings options of grilled onions, mushrooms and jalapeños are a must, and their fries are thic and delicious . I love how you bc an get Cajun spice on the side and peanuts are always fun to munch on as we wait.
Service was great they were friendly and willing to answer my questions!","1/22/2023",0
"Five Guys","My parents and I went, we spent $52 with 3 hotdogs and 1 large cup of fries. Even actual restaurants are cheaper sometimes. 
A large cup of fries almost $8, they are horrible, a simple hot dog almost $9.","12/6/2022",0
"Five Guys","Burgers are still good if you like a greasy messy burger which I do. I ordered a large fries to share normally it's enough for 3 of us because they use to put extra in the bag but this time none in the bag and the cup was only 75% full. $8 for fries you can at least give me the full cup of fries see pic. They were super greasy too.","8/16/2022",0
"Five Guys","The quality of the food has taken a dive since it's inception. Each time I order very specifically they just can't get it together. I suppose if I ordered every topping they have it would be easier. Don't allow yourself to be fooled that these kids aren't high af and can't concentrate enough to get your shit right. All other locations are just better...","5/9/2022",1
"Five Guys","Normal love the burgers and fries. Tonight's order was awful. Spent over $50 dollars for a few burgers, hot dog, and fries. Fries were soggy and luke warm at best. Super disappointing. With what you pay for Five Guys should not have been a McDonalds experience. Will most likely not order from here again, too many other options when you are talking about these kind of prices.","10/14/2022",0
"Five Guys","I have never seen such an improvement in a store such as this one. New management under James and let me just say this man goes ABOVE AND BEYOND. I could literally taste the love in the food. Store was sanitized and odorless. Greeted with a smile and left eating the best fast food burger we have EVER HAD. Seriously. Great job James and staff!","8/12/2022",0
"Five Guys","If you want a hockey puck burger, greasy luke warm fries, then this is the place for you. So disappointing! I swore I would not go back  but did so after a previous bad experience. Yep, same old crap, just a different day.","10/1/2021",2
"Five Guys","Since when did five guys stop adding fries to the bag?  Just spent a lot of additional $$ to get it delivered and our fries looked like this and there was none in the bag.  Had I known that they weren't gonna add the extra scoop, I would have gotten a bigger size.","3/21/2021",1
"Five Guys","Again, we ordered to take out and these guys cannot make a hamburger as we ordered. Mine was with jalapeños and mustard that I never ordered.
We just realized all the wrong until we are on the house.... come on guys, is just a hamburger!!! How hard it can be??!!!","5/17/2020",1
"Five Guys","I really wanted to like this place. Even though my Texas Burger Bucket List is world famous (to me), not every place can be a winner. I told Ricky to take me somewhere for a good burger. Five Guys has a good reputation, so I expected a lot. What I got was a run of the mill burger and fries. It wasn't bad, but my taste buds said we're still waiting. Unfortunately, my review matches the rest of the reviews. For that much money, you truly expect more. Might be back, might not! Sorry Guys.","1/11/2020",21
"Five Guys","I ordered online so maybe that's the start of the problem. I got a notification saying my order was ready. I left for the restaurant (still 15 minutes away) to arrive to an empty restaurant and my order not even started yet. No worries, I had time. Then got home and my order was wrong. My bad for not checking before I left, but just a disappointment.","4/11/2022",0
"Five Guys","I came to this location on a weekday for a late lunch. Apparently the lunch rush got the better of the location because it looked I like a tornado went through there. Napkins on the floor, dirty tables, fries strewn about. The cashier that took my order was deflated like a balloon after a kid's birthday party. She wasn't friendly and when I asked for a suggestion on what to get she didn't respond. I went with the hotdog with mustard and fries. The service was relatively quick in about 15 minutes. The fries were popping hot and fresh. My hotdog was split in two which may be how they are supposed to be served here but I'm not sure. I would have preferred it while but the flavor was good. Definitely not a cheaply made hotdog. The food was good but the location's appearance left much to be desired.","8/11/2019",3
"Five Guys","This place is near my work, so I decided to venture over during lunch. The advertised hours are from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. seven days a week, and my lunch break is well after 11 am, so I figured it wouldn't be a problem. To my shock, when I drive over at about 1 pm, the doors are locked, the lights are off, and the store is closed. I looked around for signs stating that the store was closed down or the hours have changed... Nothing. There were no signs indicating that the store should have been changed. I wasted 30 minutes going over to this restaurant, check the website before I went over just to make sure it was open, only to find out that they decided not to open up. It would really be helpful to warn your customers that your hours are changed or that you won't be open for some reason. Pretty idiotic and rude and I won't try this Five Guys location again.","5/12/2021",0
"Five Guys","Only Jesse showed up to work tonight, but he showed up strong. The food was delicious! Really appreciated Jesse keeping the restaurant open, providing great service, and enforcing masks inside while still running the restaurant.","7/5/2020",0
"Five Guys","It had been a while since having five guys but had a craving for it and decided to,  knowingly, splurge on a burger from there because we really wanted cajun fries.  Paid a crazy amount, but, again,  knew it would be a lot for burgers. But  we were expecting the food to be delicious.  This food was so bland I thought we had gotten covid.  I'm not kidding,  it was that flavorless. My wife ate some ice cream after just to see if her taste buds were working,  they were.  The food just had no flavor to it.  For such a high priced item you expect good flavor....or any flavor. 
Don't waste your money here.
To top it off they have us regular fries instead of cajun.
Not worth it to spend your money here.","1/22/2021",1
"Five Guys","Five guys are a no no when you are on a diet. It just fits perfect to Texan tastebud especially their cajun fries and complimentary toppings you can request! I usually go for a little cheese burger with basic toppings and add additional jalapeño peppers. It fulfills me so much. Although price is little higher compared to other fast food joints, you can always share a coke or fries with another person making the total to be close to $22. 

Tip: i definitely think regular size fries is for 2, not 1. So dont be too greedy and just control your portion if you are concerned with any binge eating or calorie limits. 

If you have that slight British kind of mind, always complement malt vinegar with your fries or burger. Great option to enjoy at the joint.","9/15/2016",2
"Five Guys","Love the flavor and food however they have become un-reasonable in my opinion for price/value. 

I know I have a choice and will exercise it but wanted 5 Guys to know my opinion as a long time customer. Almost $9 for cheese burger only and everything is a la carte. Meal with drink was $18. 

I'm sure your doing ok financially without me but can't imagine how long you'll sustain charging these high prices. Just my .02 cents.","10/2/2019",1
"Five Guys","My favorite burger!!!!!! I love the very fresh REAL POTATO fries!!!
I miss the peanuts. Since COVID19 we stay home and order in or pick up food, so no more peanuts.","5/25/2020",0
"Five Guys","The quality of the food has taken a dive since it's inception. Each time I order very specifically they just can't get it together. I suppose if I ordered every topping they have it would be easier. Don't allow yourself to be fooled that these kids aren't high af and can't concentrate enough to get your shit right. All other locations are just better...","5/9/2022",1
"Five Guys","5 Guys used to be the one place I would eat a burger, other than homemade. Unfortunately, they seem to be resting on their laurels.  We ate there about 6 months ago and I was rather disappointed on how small the actual hamburger patty was. Service was slow.  

Tonight, the whole experience turned us off.  Four guys were on the line.  Seemed like that was plenty.  There was a mother/son in front of us, and the 2 of us.  It took awhile for one of them to come over and take our orders. There were only 2 tables of customers and 2 people waiting for food. 

We went to get a table and all 11 tables were dirty. I asked someone behind the counter if they could clean a table.  When he came out he said they had been really slammed. Then he proceeded to clean the table by brushing all the dirt to one spot....with his hand. Then knocking it into the dust pan.  The other tables were cleaned the same way....just dusting off crumbs. Nothing used to actually clean them.  We were so grossed out we took our food to go.  

The food was ok, but spending $24 for 2 burgers and a fry makes us feel it could have been a lot better.","8/17/2019",1
"Five Guys","I don't think you can ever go wrong with Five Guys, but this is now our go to location. We went one time when we were in the area. Since then, we always come back (even though there is a location closer to our house). The service and quality is exceptional, and worth the extra drive.","7/31/2021",0
"Five Guys","Dropped in late on a Sunday evening and had a terrible experience.  I haven't been to a five guys in a long time and the craving hit me as I was passing by.  I turned around and regretted it as soon as I started placing my order.  

The young man taking my order also was a cook.  He handled the cash register and the cash with the same gloves he had been conking with then went back to cooking with the same ones.  He saw me watching him and he did finally change gloves but I wondered if this would have been done if no one was watching.  He also was impatient with me at the register. Having not been there in many years, I was unfamiliar with the menu and had to take a minute to order.    

Fast forward, it took A LONG TIME to get my order.  30 min in fact.  Only one person was a head of me and one person came in after me and they both received their order long before I did.  I only ordered a cheese burger and fries which cost me close to $20!  

I took my order to go to the hotel next door.  So I was opening my food less than 10 min after the meal was given to me.  Hands down the worst burger and fries I've ever had.  NONE of the fries were cooked and the burger was so sloppy that I could not pick it up to eat.  It was loaded with mustard which made it taste like I was eating mustard from the jar.  I ended up throwing the entire meal away after only eating a couple bites.  

I could say so much more but I'll just leave it at that.  
I will give them  another try one day because I know this is atypical for a five guys but this visit left a bad taste in my mouth, literally.","1/6/2019",4
"Five Guys","The good news first, their fries are great! Very delicious, hot out of the fryer and with the right amount of salt and grease, I highly recommend them. 

As for the burgers, I'd have to rate these as a 3 out of 10. There is nothing about these burgers that justifies paying an exorbitant price for what was a tasteless and mundane burger. I had a bacon cheeseburger with pickles, tomato, mustard and grilled onions, which should make the burger a cornucopia of great flavors but sadly, I found that I couldn't even taste anything but the mustard. 

One thing I found off putting was the guy who was taking our order was sweating so much that he had rivulets of sweat pouring down his face. 

Another issue that I have with the place is that it is dirty, there were discarded napkins on the floor and smooshed fries that had been left on the floor without it being swept up. The manager or shift lead past by this crap several times and never even noticed the detritus that adorned floor. She never stopped to pick the crap up or direct anyone to sweep it up!
 
Also the drink machines (there's two there in the shop) both had various selections out such as lemonade and Coke Zero. 

All in all, I will not return here when there's much better places that have great tasting burgers and that are clean and can be had for a much more reasonable price! I don't mind paying for a good burger, but Five Guys misses the mark in taste and cleanliness","9/7/2019",0
"Five Guys","My experience at Five Guys was pleasant. With the COVID-19 epidemic in effect, the online ordering was easy. The confirmation said my order would be ready for pickup in 6 minutes and true to their word when I arrived my meal was at the counter ready. My bacon cheeseburger was delicious but honestly, was overpriced for almost $10. I've had burgers for half that price of equal/better quality WITH more meat. Again, the burger was delicious but not worth the price.","3/26/2020",1
"Five Guys","ABSOLUTELY REDICULOUS. Insane wait time (going on 18 mins now) with only 3 orders in front of me! Brought the burgerS (plural) back cause they were made incorrectly, and the new ones were INCORRECT as well (face palm)! Will not be coming back! Had to clean off 2 tables just so we could sit down, BOTH trash cans are overflowing, and the floor has food AND garbage under almost every table.

If I were the manager, there'd be some major butt  chewings goin around for this crew. But that's just 28 years in the Army talking.","5/25/2019",0
"Five Guys","CAJUN FRIES EVERYONE! GET THE CAJUN FRIES! 

I always heard about people coming here but I always thought it was just another boring burger place. 
It is a burger place but not boring! 
With the price you pay its so worth to go! 
They have complimentary peanuts that you can just eat on the side. 

For each burger you can choose extras to put in. They have a lot of choices and they are all free no extra fees! 
Now the fries!
Get the cajun fries !
They are so good! I think I would come here again just for the fries no burgers :)","12/29/2016",2
"Five Guys","Very good burgers. The the Cajun fries are awesome and worth a try. The food is a little pricey but well worth it.","2/22/2017",1
"Five Guys","We ordered lunch today on the Five Guys website. When our order delivered we did not get our drinks. I called the store and the guy that answered the phone asked me how I placed my order...I told him through their website. He then told me that the driver has left without the drinks. Iasked him if he would send them back out and i was told we dont have any drivers, your more then welcome to come pick them up later. ARE YOU KIDDING ME!?! I want my drink with my lunch, not when i get off at 6!! I asked for a refund on the $2.85 BOTTLED drinks and was told there was nothing they can do about it. Yes its only $6.17, but that 6$ on TWO cokes and I have no drink with my lunch!","8/19/2020",0
"Five Guys","Ugh, I'm so sad that my last few experiences here have been terrible! I tried to give them the benefit the first time thinking it was just a bad day but it seems to be consistent now. 
When you walk up the outdoor trash cans are always overflowing (I understand they aren't responsible for them, but it's not something you want to see and it would be in their best interest to contact the property manager about it!). The staff has been unprofessional, up to the point they seemed to be playing around and made me raise questions about food safety standards. 
My last few orders have also been incorrect.... as they we're missing a side of BBQ, or some of the toppings I asked for... it's a bit subtle but when you order something you should expect it to be correct. I account this to the playing around the staff was doing as I brought up earlier. 
Five Guys used to be a solid go to for a good burger but I now go out of my way to places like LibertyBurger or MooYa which I don't even like as much.","6/2/2018",3
"Five Guys","When I walked in to pick my food up all the ladies behind the counter were literally having their own personal conversation... They didn't even notice the customer that had just walked in(including the The manager Gaby).       
Gaby took my order and she completely messed it up! 
When I called up there to let her know that she had completely butchered my order and didn't put bacon on my BACON cheese burgers, she got extremely defensive! 
First she dismissed my complaint by laughing because she had dropped the phone while I was talking She then said that she warped the burgers herself and there was no way that they were wrong.......
she probably didn't notice she wasn't doing her job correctly since her private conversation has a lot more important!!! If that's supposed to be the manager I can't even imagine how the rest of the staff is!  Drive a little further and go to a different location.","2/11/2018",1
"Five Guys","Five guys burgers are always good and there fries are also very good.  But $28 for a small burger, a grilled cheese, two fries and two small drinks is unbelievable.  I think I'll go somewhere else for that price.","7/19/2019",1
"Five Guys","Bacon burger with fries and a drink. $14.17
Lower quality than Braums. I'll go to Braums next time and I can have a real moo cow ice cream shake with my burger.","3/2/2015",3

"Five Guys","Never have to wait long for my food (dine in or call in order) food is always AMAZING! Service is for the most part pleasant. Tables can be a little messy but everything else is clean even the bathroom.","4/5/2018",0
"Five Guys","I don't know how to rate this. Does it matter if the food is up to Five Guys standards (it was) if the place was messy to the point of being borderline gross? Sticky tables with trash on them, garbage overflowing, crap on the floor, etc. The place was by no means packed, either, so they should have had someone sweeping up and wiping down the tables. It's basic Restaurant 101. 

I just can't when it's dirty.","3/4/2017",1
"Five Guys","Have to agree with so many others, the burger was fine. The fries were good, the drinks were the same as every other place that has the same Coke provided machines. The problem (for me anyway) was that it's a terrible value for the money. Twice the price of what it's worth. No offense but they don't deserve the profits they are reaping...","1/26/2020",0
"Five Guys","Love the baconator fries!!! Never get rid of them!!! I usually get extra cheese because there's never enough! Service is hit or miss but I never leave hungry! Will try to update with photos. Better than Freddys and McDonalds cheese fries. Addictive!","2/8/2019",0

"Five Guys","HMM so i got the veggie burger and cajun fries.  I did an online order and requested it to be ready by 11:15.... i got there at 11:20pm and still had to wait antoher 5 mins to get my food.

So when I think of a veggie burger, i am thinking they have a veggie patty in the sandwich along with the other free toppings they have.  However, I did not have a patty in there, it was just lettuce, mushrooms, onions, peppers, cheese, and the sauces.  I was highly disapointed by that.  The cajun fries were REALLY GOOD, but I wouldn't back here again just for the fries.","7/5/2012",2
"Five Guys","If your not hungry don't come here if you are hungry they save a large burger which is not only delicious but very filling. Fries are real potatoes and the potatoes are on display in boxes out front. I went after the lunch rush and the place needed some wiping down if it wasn't for that I would of given them 5 stars.  It's pricey and worth it if your hungry.","7/25/2017",1
"Five Guys","I rarely  eat burgers but when i have one it needs to be great.  My burger last night was great and fries were even better (cajun style). The place flooded with people while we sat an ate. 

Staff was friendly,  very clean and all the ingredients were fresh and nicely placed. 

Will be going again soon lol

CHOW","12/27/2014",2
"Five Guys","Expensive - More than  6.00 for a regular size burger; if you want cheese or bacon, that's extra. The fries are generous portions, thick cut, and you can get cajun flavored, which are a little spicy.

Burgers are cooked with a little pink in the center. I asked about getting a hot dog grilled crispy, as all their hotdogs are cut almost in half and grilled. I was told that they can only cook burgers and fries the five guy way and cannot make burgers and hot dogs well done. Good to know. 

The restaurant is decorated with quotes and rave reviews, but I couldn't find any from Texas sources.","8/16/2014",2
"Five Guys","I visited the Lewisville location on 1/1/2016 @ 5:19pm CST and I must say that will never go back.
When I received my food the Cajun seasoning wasn't on my fries, my burger was COLD after a 15 minute wait for my food and the service was horrible.
I understand that it's NEW YEARS DAY and people don't want to be at work, but really COLD food???!!!!

I will NOT go to Five Guys ever again, plus the food has no flavor might I add.","1/1/2016",0
"Five Guys","This place just opened.  It was packed! Had the cheeseburger. Pretty good. A little sloppy. Lady was pretty helpful and recommended the cajun seasoning.

I finally had the fries. Go with the cajun seasoned. 

Do it! Cheeseburger french fries with cajun seasoning!","4/13/2012",0

"Five Guys","Go at 9:30pm and avoid all these negative comments. My boyfriend and I LOVE this place, we cannot get enough. The staff is FANTASTIC they're funny, nice, attentive, the works! We keep coming back for their mouth watering little burgers and cajun fries! We have nominated this restaurant and this specific location as our all time favorite. I would suggest giving this place another try if you've had a bad experience, because we are in love with it. They don't even complain when we came in at 9:45 one time, they welcomed us with open arms and even sang with my boyfriend to one of the songs playing overhead. I forgot his name, but one of the coworkers, a young african american man, recommended drinks to my boyfriend from the really cool machine. 
We make it a weekly trip when we have the funds. Give this place a chance!","4/22/2015",0
"Five Guys","Great burgers and the fries are delicious. I daren't look at the calorie count, but oh well! 
I really like that the staff seem to be happy and friendly-an overall good atmosphere and good food. There are five guys locations all over the place, which is nice. 

They also have peanuts to snack on while you wait for your food. I found this a little odd at first, but I now  look forward to them!","7/29/2015",0
"Five Guys","Well this place has really went down hill. I usually go to the Denton location which is run much better than this place.  When I arrived, it wasn't busy at all, so I ordered my food and I will admit the lady who took my order was very nice.

It went down hill from there, 20 minutes to receive my food and other people were also complaining why it is taking so long to get their food.

The restaurant was dirty, food on the floor, dirty tables and no one took the time to clean at all,  which I was there for almost 50 minutes.

Fries were not good at all, actually soggy and not crispy at all.

Will never visit the location again.","10/15/2016",1
"Five Guys","What's with the double layer of nasty velvetta chees?.  First time I went I didn't see what all the hype was about. Ok, peanuts are there to eat out of the shell. They have french fries overflowing in large size cups. Their burgers are big and juicy like other competitors. NOPE, I didn't see the appeal of greasy burgers and salty fries. 
I went again with friends and family with expectations of a MSG/Gluten Free meal for my allergic children. I remembered my first experience as I stood staring at the menu: burger, cheeseburger, hotdog, cheese dog, grilled cheese, BLT.  I went with a BLT, then added cheese when caught off guard when asked if I wanted it. GROSS.  
Then a friend said after his dinner all he tasted was cheese, nasty processed cheese.
1 positive: my kids didn't get sick from gluten.","2/26/2014",2
"Five Guys","Food Quality:Great. The food was extremely fresh and made to order, exactly as I requested it to be made. Delicious. 

Service:Staff was attentive. Our order was taken without any sort of wait, though the enthusiasm of the person on register was lackluster. 

Price:More than I would usually pay for a burger. However, I think that I did get my money's worth since freshness and taste scored so high. 

Will I go again? If I am in the mood for something different than my usual, I might stop in there since I frequently pass it.","6/2/2015",0
"Five Guys","Burger was sloopy & not work $12. Worst location I've been too & I definitely won't be back. Your better off going to Smashburger where they will give you more quality for your $$$. Only thing worth eating is the Cajun fries because they can't mess that up.","2/25/2019",0
"Five Guys","Gone down the drain. Ordered a cheeseburger. First off $8 for a cheeseburger theyve raised their prices. Had to wait 25-30 mins for the burger to come out and the quality was awful. Like mcdonalds has a better burger than what I was served. I hope the other stores havent gone down in quality and hopefully this was a one time experience","7/17/2016",0
"Five Guys","Standard Five Guys burger joint, complete with self-congratulatory framed publications and red/white color scheme. I liked that this location has the cool soda machine with all the fizzy drinks known to man. 

Ordering snafu resulted in my receiving a ketchup double bacon cheese burger instead of the mayo single bacon burger with extra onions. Looks like this site needs to work on their quality control.

Great cajun fries as always!","1/16/2014",1
"Five Guys","I'm curious why they wrap their burgers in foil.  Mine was wrapped and in the bag and waiting at least five minutes for the fries.  It steams in the foil wrap and makes a mushy bun.  Not such a good burger!  I guess the fries guy got behind on fries orders so my burger had to wait.","11/13/2016",0
"Five Guys","Very very expensive place..... If you pay 15-20$ for a burger and slide of French fry you would assume it'll be the best burger ever but NO.. tasteless, no seasoning and very bad price. Not coming back!","2/7/2019",0
"Five Guys","Came here with my boyfriend to just try it out. The price was fine for the food and fries were just the expected quantity but to be completely honest they fries were the best part. Burgers are average but made right in front of you which is more than a fast food place. Not made from frozen and it taste much better. But definitely nothing amazing. Unfortunately the fries alone will not get me to come back. Better luck next time!","6/5/2016",0

"Five Guys","This burger joint is new to Lewisville and I went in without any real expectations.This is a no frills restaurant. You order your burger (they also have hot dogs, which I hear are not that good), select the toppings, and pick your fries (I like the plain ones, the cajun seasoning was a bit much after eating a few of the cajun fries). You receive fries galore by the way. One order can feed 2-3 people easily. The hamburger was cooked to perfection, the meat was very fresh, and it was MMM good. 

What really impressed me was the level of service. We had at least 3 people, along with the manager come to our table and check on us. I am not sure if that was because we went during opening week, but the staff was great!","5/11/2012",2
"Five Guys","The burgers are really good but kind of expensive. And it cost extra for the fries which makes no sense. It's like $26 for two burgers with fries. I would still recommend that you try the burgers.","3/5/2015",2

"Five Guys","Was looking forward to having a decent meal with our family and we didn't get that.  Our order was wrong - it wasn't like they were super busy there were only three other customers.  Our burgers were over cooked and dry.  The fries were over cooked as well.  The restaurant itself was not very comfortable temperature wise - it was like the air conditioner was not working.  What was disappointing was that I paid almost $50 for 4 people and got horrible food.  This place is the worst - do not waste your time here.","9/9/2017",1
"Five Guys","I love five guys. The food is outstanding. I especially love their Cajun fries! Five guys is a normal place of mines to go to. The prices are high, but you get what you pay for. I don't mind spending 10 for a quality burger and fries.","9/1/2015",0
"Five Guys","Their burgers are good.  Definitely better than In-N-Out.  But there are so many good burger joints in Texas that this seems average.

"Five Guys","I love a good burger and fries.  Who doesn't?  So when a group of co-workers suggested some Five Guys, I wasn't thrilled..but I went.  I've had 5G's many times before.  I used to work by one so it was convenient.  This location is in a prime/busy as crap area off the Bush.  Parking was interesting at lunchtime for sure.  The staff was friendly and the food came out relatively quick, my 2 star review is based on price vs quality.  I get it, you order fries and they give you a years worth...you order a 2 patty burger, sure, it's a decent size.  But the price is too steep for a mediocre product.  The fries were extra greasy and the bun split in two after the first bite.  I wasn't bummed enough to speak to a manager or anything, but I just won't go back.  Its too expensive and I can get a much better burger at an actual restaurant and have a waiter and spend much less than what I did.","10/30/2014",2
"Five Guys","We enjoy your burgers but your options need upgrading. Gluten-free buns would help. Your music is ALWAYS TOO LOUD and not conducive to having a conversation while dining. Metal chairs and stone floors create a loud annoying atmosphere.","5/13/2018",0
"Five Guys","Have just tried the fries here and they are awesome, specially with the cajun seasoning! Enjoyed them immensely!","4/5/2015",1
"Five Guys","Short and simple-- the burgers don't have that much taste and the fries are soaked in grease.

Ordering from this place is pretty terrifying experience because by the time you get to your car the bag is already soaked in grease.  This is because Five Guys is one of those obnoxious places that pour A LOT of fries on top of everything in the bag.  It's bad enough the fries are disgusting and soggy, but they also cover everything else (napkin included) in grease.

The burger itself is pretty much bland and nothing special.  It's better than your typical fast food burger, but only because you can choose your toppings.  Beyond that, it's really not worth it.","9/13/2012",1

"Five Guys","Excellent burgers and fries. The burger was perfectly cooked and had the right amount of condiments that I ordered. My wife loved the fries with Malt Vinegar.","7/16/2015",0
"Five Guys","I stop by about once a week, usually after working late. It's not my favorite burger, but it's still pretty tasty. The expansive menu of add-on condiments is quite nice, as is the ability to order from my iPhone.

Like some of the other reviewers, I'm not a fan of the grease-soaked fries being thrown on top of the burger in a bag. 

The fries are one of those love or hate things. I tried once with the Cajun seasoning at a location in Seattle and decided it wasn't for me. I would probably like the fries more if they had less potato skin and were cooked a little more thoroughly. 

Service here is really good. I arrived a little early after placing an order from my iPhone and was offered a drink on the house for while I waited. I also appreciate that they recognize me as a repeat customer, which makes me feel that they truly appreciate my patronage. 

If you're looking for a nice fat burger and tons of fries, this is the place for you. I do not recommend eating here if you're on a tight budget (financial or calories) because it will definitely slim your wallet while adding to your waist.","3/11/2013",0
"Five Guys","This is a super expensive place for just a burger and fries almost 13-14$. If it was cheaper like 7-8$ then the food definitely worth it. The portions are decent you'll definitely be full but with 8$ you could go to Chick-fil-A and be just as full. It has a nice look and atmosphere though and food cooked fresh!","8/6/2017",0
"Five Guys","I can't remember if I have eaten at Five Guys Burgers before or not. Today I was in a hurry and happened to be right next to this place so I decided to get a burger. I ordered a cheeseburger and fries. The burger was almost $8 which seemed a little high for a place like this and the fries were $3.19 which also seemed a little high. Well I got the hamburger and boy what a disappointment. It was really rather pitiful looking. I took a picture of it with my medium sized hand on it just for size comparison. The flavor was just ok but I would definitely say this is one of the sorriest burgers I've eaten in a while. You really have to try to make a bad hamburger. The other thing I noticed which is probably straight from corporate is that they had all of these huge signs hanging in the window. The signs stated things like Voted Best Burger Miami Herald or something similar. I counted about nine or ten of these huge signs hanging in the window. Trust me, if you have the best burger around, you won't have to hang signs in the window to let people know this. I was there at dinner time and I was the only customer for a while. That should have been my first clue. Eventually two other customers walked in but that was it. I definitely would not go back. When you start talking about $12 (see receipt) for a hamburger and fries (that was with me drinking a free cup of water) there are far better choices to be had. I guess if I had gotten a soft drink it would have been close to $15. I had a shrimp and pasta dish with fresh baked rolls the other day in a nice restaurant for $15. C'mon Five Guys! Any of the other fast food burger chains has a better burger for much less money.","4/24/2017",0
"Five Guys","This place opens at 11:00am. Doesn't mean they are ready for business at 11:00am. My receipt says 11:07 and it is now 11:33 and I have no food. It's now 11:35 and I have food. The burger is cold and the fries are hot. Not good. Mcdonald's wins this contest.","2/4/2017",0
"Five Guys","I love hamburgers and fries almost as much as I love life. Five Guys makes a great double burger and fries.  It is moderately priced and I love the staff and the service. I have been there many  times and the burgers are consistent and the portions of fries are more than a person can eat.","7/7/2014",0
"Five Guys","The was the first time eating here and it was amazing..the service is very very good. The food was AWSOME I have never tasted a burger like the one I had .. Yum Yum","12/11/2013",1
"Five Guys","This post will probably get deleted or moved to somewhere in Yelp's non approved bin again but I will continue to post as often as I have the time. ENJOY!

Don't believe Yelp about being fair and objective. If you don't post as often as they would like then your opinion IS NOT VALID.

NOW ON WITH MY ORIGINAL REVIEW........

Let's get straight to the point here....WAY OVER PRICED!  

I took my daughter here to get a burger and fries. I knew it was going to be more expensive than McDonald's or Wendy's but I was absolutely shocked when I was told that a Double Cheese burger, fries and a drink was going to cost over $14!

I guess they think that stacking a bunch of potato boxes that have labels on where they are from can justify their ridiculous costs so that you can feel warm and cozy that they are using local (or not) suppliers.

Oh, and don't be fooled by the numerous accolades on the wall from years past!

For the same money head down a couple of blocks to the Wild Turkey where you can have a waiter/waitress serve you a great burger and fries including the tip.

Of course there is the Whataburger a few blocks down from the Wild Turkey that is open 24hr and has burgers that are really good as well!","3/24/2015",0
"Five Guys","Ah the burgers at Five Guys! Such a treat! I've read the reviews and I can't understand for the life of me why their burgers get such low marks. They're so good! Every burger comes with double patties as a standard so if you'd like something smaller, you have to specifically tell the staff. Their fries are hand cut daily so they taste better than anything you get from fast food. Add some Cajun spice mix to them for an extra kick. A word of warning: the large order of fries should be called massive instead. It can easily feed three people. Hotdogs are also on the menu but I've never personally tried them. They also play classic rock over their speakers which I LOVE! I wouldn't recommend eating this type of burger on a regular basis but it's a really welcome alternative to the fast food joints that dot our landscape.","5/8/2014",0
"Five Guys","I usually don't right a review but feeling one should be written. This is my second time eating at Five Guys but my first time going into this one. I felt bad as siblings and I arrived 20 minutes before closing, due it takes quality time to make our food. They did not to seem minded at all the lady that was their ( 05/19/15) she was extremely nice and helped us out allot. The guy was extremely incredible too! He came up to us and ask if we needed anything. He went up to my brother and gave us cups and told us figure y'all might be thirsty. By the time our food came out it was only 7 minuets left and we try to rush to eat it. He came over and say no don't rush to eat, take your time. Over all a really nice atmosphere and people.","6/20/2015",1
"Five Guys","When I first had Five Guys in KS, they had the best fries. The franchise in Lewisville makes that a wonderful memory. The fries were greasy, soggy and inedible! Hopefully, someone will fix the fryers or whatever is causing the issue.","10/29/2013",0
"Five Guys","Best burgers in Lewisville and friendly staff, too! If you leave hungry it's your own fault!","7/8/2012",1
"Five Guys","I normally really like 5 guys but this location is the worst I've been to. The best part is always the Cajun fries that I order extra crispy. This location will NOT do extra crispy fries. The manager tried to tell me it was because the type of oil they use would hallow out the fry. I asked why none of the other 3 locations I've been to have this issue because all of them do extra crispy fries and they are delicious. She only responded they couldn't do it. I've never seen a restaurant refuse to make something the way you want it. Those were the worst soggy fries I've had. I was offered a refund for the fries but that was not the point. All they had to do is cook them for and extra 2 mins and I would have been good. That was the worst customer service ever. I get better service at McDonald's.","5/14/2015",1
"Five Guys","Good burger made fresh as ordered. The place can be noisy at times. Super fries and a soda machine that offers an abundance of choices. Good place for an occasional visit. Burger Street Station makes a better burger at a lower price.","8/29/2015",0
"Five Guys","I wasn't overwhelmed, (but I think it was over hyped)  but this is a solid burger.  All the topping are great.  Get the cajun seasoned fries.  Picture two patties, with your choice of topping, executed to perfection and you've got the idea.","4/22/2012",0
"Five Guys","I swear they have the best cheeseburgers, made to order, and the fries can't be beat.
So happy you can get mushrooms and so many other extras. The prices are very reasonable, the staff is friendly. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for down home burgers, fries and hot dogs!","7/9/2013",0
"McDonald's","The McDonalds itself was okay on service but that's about the only 2 stars I'll give it.

1) Some young dudes in the drive-through heckled my girlfriend as we walked past their car by the drive-thru. It's weird that the parking is on the opposite side of the building from the doors and that you have to walk down a line of cars to get into the restaurant.

2) The food was very McDonalds-esque. The Southwestern Chicken Sandwich was pretty small but ultimately what expected. The chicken in the grilled chicken salad looked pink.

3) Location, meh. If you're in the area, you already know.

There are better places to eat.","2/25/2013",2
"McDonald's","To many kids working here with no care they have messed my order up a couple of times here but this is the last time I stop here do better McDonald's!","8/14/2022",0
"McDonald's","Been here twice in the morning. Food was hot and fresh, ordered on app for very fast service, and the dining room is very clean. Confused by the poor reviews, but I would recommend this McDonald's for morning commuters on I-30 W","11/10/2021",1
"McDonald's","This McDonalds is on a tiny corner lot. But they were friendly, service was fast, food was piping hot. No complaints!","10/11/2021",2
"McDonald's","Order was incorrect in drive thru. I ordered two happy meals the exact same but MCD only registered one.

I acknowledged error in communication at drive thru but I had clearly stated two happy meals, not one. 

Employee was unwilling to correct the order despite my willingness to pay additional cost. He proceeded to tell me to get out of here. 

I asked for the manager who came to window and said he would not correct the issue and I could drive back around or go to another MCD. He then repeatedly told me to leave, shewing me away with a hand jester multiple times.  

Both employees gave zero effort to resolve the problem or just acknowledge the communication error. The language and tone they used was like nothing i've ever experienced.

I proceeded to park and enter the store. It is restaurant #26541 located at 5337 E. Grand Ave, Dallas, TX 75223. I got the manager's name, it is Arturo. His supervisor is Brett. 

Truly unacceptable to be treated in this manner, especially when I was more than willing to pay for the additional happy meal and help resolve the issue. I could have simply pulled thru to the waiting area but apparently that too was not an option the employee and manager were willing to entertain.","7/26/2022",0

"McDonald's","Order through the App, order 1935 on 08/05/20. Waited longer than other people that went through drive thru as well as other customers that pulled up in the mobile order spots, meaning you have to check-in and then your order is processed/placed,which wait time is roughly 5 mins, which seems way too long to begin with, anyways, another customer pulls up and so they would need to check-in, and so how is it that they get their order/food before mine, regardless of what they ordered, I was there first, easily 2-3 mins before he pulled up into the mobile order spot. I then proceeded to let the employee know I was there before the gentleman he just gave the food to and asked him to check on my order. he comes out another 5 mins later, i thank him and leave. I get home only to find out that i was missing 2 sausage burritos. Its upsetting to have to go through all this and then stuff is forgotten. Should i have checked? it was a semi large order and i was already frustrated with the wait and service, so i was ready to go home. I did get my salsa packets, so thanks for that! Very poor training and reflects management. I used the mobile order to have the accuracy and the quickness of using the mobile order feature, this isn't the first time this has occurred.","8/5/2020",1
"McDonald's","Dear McDonald's,

I am highly disappointed in the service received. Ordered a happy meal - yet I was not happy.

This meal came without sauce, without proper nourishment, and I can't even describe the way the bag was thrown together. 

I ordered a milkshake. I got a milk and some attitude instead.","6/19/2018",0
"McDonald's","Worst McDonald's ever waiting over an hour on the app and they kept delaying me order when I live 5 mins away the service is horrible and the food was cold they need to get this place in order or shut it down if I could give them no stars I would !","10/24/2020",0
"McDonald's","The rep at the window told me that they were only taking cash payments. I ordered based off my cash on hand. Imagine my disbelief of the car in front of me paying with a card. 

When I got to the front, I mentioned it and the rep told me that he didn't. 

I guess me seeing him hand the card to the rep and get a receipt meant nothing. 

Wack service.","11/9/2019",0
"McDonald's","Don't come here !!! My experience was really bad the first time I went was in line for about 20 minuted and by the time I got to the speaker they were only taking cash , and then I did a order of 5 meals and extra large fries , and some chicken nuggets , asked for sauces on the speaker. Once's they gave me my food I asked for my sauces again cause there was none in the bag and the lady with an attitude told me rudely look inside the bag it's there  and it wasn't so she only gave me one bbg and one Buffalo like if that was enough for 5 different meals.","1/3/2021",0
"McDonald's","I was ordering and the lady couldn't hear me right so I had to keep speaking up. And she kept mumbling things and couldn't hear anything she was saying. I forgot to order my coffee and I asked if I could add it I hear oh my god I'm a rude way.","12/15/2020",0
"McDonald's","I waited in along line at the drive thru this morning. The two young men working the line didn't give a f#@k about us. I had to initiate the order because he couldn't be bothered to say hi or ask if I wanted anything. He sounded uninterested and bored AF. The second guy at the window seemed equally uninterested and didn't say a single word to me. I'd fire them both if they worked for me.","7/14/2019",0
"McDonald's","This McDonald's always claims to habe their systems down and they cannot take orders. Everytime. I have been here 4 times after ten pm and they say the same thing. Right now there are five cars ahead of me and they tried to use the same excuse!!! I asked how about the people ahead of me they have not paid and they reluctantly took my order. 
It is not excusable to claim to be a 24 hours establishment and close at random times for no reason at all. Your systems being down is not a good reason. I am paying with cash and you are cooking in hot grease with frozen imputs. The grease does not need computers to stay hot and the frozen food will cook if you stick it in the grease. No reason at all to not be able to take orders and make money.","3/27/2018",0
"McDonald's","Every time the night shift says there machines are down. Between 10pm or 11pm-2am. Had to argue with once before for some reason all of a sudden she could take cash. Always receive attitude. Food usually cold around that time as well.","7/21/2018",0
"McDonald's","The drive thru design at this location is the absolute worst.  You are truly trapped in the line before you can tell how long the line is. I waited almost ten minutes to order just to be told they can only take cash. And if you didn't have cash there was no escape for about 7-8 more minutes.","11/6/2016",2
"McDonald's","INCOMPETENT. How do you screw up a Happy Meal order?!?! Overcharge me for things I didn't order after I repeated my order to you 3X because it sounded like you were eating and not paying attention to customers. 20 min in the drive tru for a 6pc happy meal, unbelievable and very unacceptable. Get real Management!","1/26/2019",0
"McDonald's","Just because it's late, that is no excuse to assume that you can keep someone's change when they pay you for a meal. It's not that I need the 9¢, but the assumption that you think this is ok is disrespectful. 
My order was $3.66, so I handed her $3.75 and she only gave me a receipt. I waited until she re-opened the window and said, may I have my change?
It's $3.66 she replied.
And I gave you $3.75
She gave me a condescending look and gave me my change.
Again, I know it's only nine cents, and not that important, nor do I need it. But it's a principle. If they forgot a couple dollars off your paycheck, for every paycheck, those couple dollars add up and you'd be annoyed too.
The managers might wanna check those overnight end of shift register amounts and cameras to make sure they're not stealing from the company too.","4/2/2016",4
"McDonald's","The absolute worst McDonald's I ever been to In my life I gave them multiple chances but every single time the order is wrong and taste like complete shit ! They take 20 mins to give me my wrong order tonight and then as soon as the lady gave me the order she ran away and didn't return I sat there for another 10 minutes waiting for the lady to come back so I can switch out my order and I got mad and drive off HOW IS THIS PLACE STILL IN BUSINESS ? Shame .","4/11/2018",0
"McDonald's","Would give them less than one star... Management is a joke and the cold is gross your chessbuger should be so cold that you can take the cheese off of it..... How hard is it to use a touch screen pad to take an order; hard if you are unable to understand your clients - English was definitely not their first language.. go to the one up the highway.","11/22/2018",0
"McDonald's","Breakfast it's a very important meal. And everyone should enjoy it like everyone else guess today wasn't the day for me....I came to this location to have a delicious sausage egg en cheese mcmuffin (and it was)...but I also ask for coffee and they replied if I wanted cream and sugar and I said yes thank you when I got to the window someone was yelling inside the lady that handed me my food had an attitude and as I drove off I notice that there was 2 creams and one sugar....it's amazing how can someone ruin your day but don't take it on people's breakfast....the food was good like always in the other hand my coffee was not....","8/30/2016",0
"McDonald's","Ok, 2 cheeseburgers please.

No, prob. $5.00.

Um, Manager please. Thanks.

He's in the parking lot. Dealing.

Drugs? Sweet. Another manager please.

Sure. Here.

Did you run out of meat?

Yeah, happens all the time.

All the time?

I mean umm....yah.

Can we have the chee-burgs we just ordered. With meat.

Ya, $5.00

Um no. We already paid but thanks.

Yeah here you go.

Is there meat?

Always.

You just just it's typical with no meat. Happens all the time

Well, no. There's meat.

You sure??

"McDonald's","Drive thru is awful. Takes 15 minutes to go through & they were not too busy. Food is cold & tortilla is crunchy. When I get to the change window no one is there then when I get to the food window again no one is there. When someone finally comes to give me my food it is a manager which only makes me feel worse. If the manager is this slow and allowing cold old food out why would the employees do any better. Not very friendly either.","4/28/2017",1

"McDonald's","This location is horrible... I only go there because it's so close to my apartment. I went in the drive thru today and ordered the big breakfast with hot cakes. I opened it when I got home and there were no eggs and no biscuit. They had given me extra sausage and a sausage mcmuffin. I was very confused to say the least. I don't think these employees have a clue what they're doing.","9/6/2014",0
"McDonald's","The people I've encountered who work here are barely functioning for a paycheck. They have no common sense and when they mess things up they're VERY easily confused. Their immaturity and laziness = no customer service. I don't want to make a blanket statement about all the employees here and I'm sure some of them are okay, but the two times I've been here have been ridiculous.","3/24/2016",0
"McDonald's","Customer service was fine, but from what I know every McDonald's is suppose to serve lunch 24/7. I went around 10:00 in the morning and asked to have a kids happy meal which they denied because they were only serving breakfast  .","5/16/2020",0
"McDonald's","I have visited and ordered from your store at 8403 Galand Rd. several times in the last weeks.  I have been going to this store for about  a year now.  As of late, none of my orders have been correct.  I cannot give you a receipt # because I was not offered one-I always have to ask for my receipt.
Today, I ordered a sausage mcmuffin and breakfast burritos.  What I got was sausage and egg on something that looked like a waffle? I could smell the syrup on the bread.  Also, the burrito order was only 1 burrito.  Your signage shows 2 burritos on the order.
Everytime I go there here recently my order has gotten more wrong than the previous time.  
By the time I discovered the mistake (each time I've ordered), I'm several miles down the road-so going back is not an option.  
I will not visit this location again.  You're people are unable to get anything right.

They threw my fries in the bag and they were cold and nasty .

"McDonald's","I can see why this has a one and a half star rating. Worst meal of my life. And McDonalds has a university to create consistency. They must let you graduate with a D~. Cole fries, chicken sandwich horribly flavored and drenched in some sauce that got everywhere. And I didn't even order a spicy sandwich but it is what I got. It's also the size of the old kids burger. Big Mac used to be something I would crave. This was a shadow of that. And again the size of a kids sandwich. I payed nearly $14 for a meal I wouldn't feed my worst enemy. You should all be embarrassed as a company to he putting out food like this. By the way this is my third visit and they have all been bad. This one just stood out as the icing of the cake. If you were a startup business you would not last 6 months. Good thing your a wealthy company. The McDonald brothers would be ashamed of what you have become. As a restaurant owner I cannot see how we can look at you as a model of success for our industry. You only win on history and not the merits of what you have become. I'm embarrassed your associated with America. You represent what we have become. Mediocrity.","3/5/2022",1

I corrected her ( McGriddle vs. McMuffin) she had already made a McGriddle apparently bc she decided it wasn't important if my order was right even though it was completely missed in the first place and just gave me the McGriddle.. but not before asking for a receipt to prove I had just been there even though I was never even given a receipt.

"McDonald's","Someone at this McDonalds doesn't know what is going on. There is a sign as you pull into the drive thru still advertising the 3 Big Macs (Grand, Big and Jr), but the gentleman working the drive thru around 8:40pm tonight advised me that they no longer server Mac Jrs. 
Strange, the website still has information about them ... hmmmm Who is lying?","3/29/2017",0
"McDonald's","Just because this place looks nice doesn't mean the people are. Always out of apple pies too. The drive thru lady is so rude and you can clearly tell she is annoyed and hates her job. I'm sure someone else a lot more grateful than her would like to have a job.","1/17/2016",1
"McDonald's","Well, just got home and black hair was in my food. In my fries and burger, as if they are playing a sick game. The hair was perfectly lying  on the cheese and the fries. When I picked up the food in the drive thru, not one person would look at me. They quickly got my money then hurried me through. I had a hunch something wasn't right... SICK!!!","1/15/2019",0
"McDonald's","This is absolutely the worst one I've ever been to. You asked for easy eyes I think they put extra. I spent $12 there I asked her napkin and if they argue with me that they're in the bag I have to show it to him.. and they want more money an hour they can't even do that job.","3/23/2016",0
"McDonald's","This location is terrible.  They always leave something out of the order.  How do you forget 6 McDoubles.  I called over and over trying to get someone to answer so I could just go the next day to get the burgers, but no answer in over 15 calls.  I went back to the location and had the phone in my hand while I was calling, they still did not answer, and there was not a customer to be found.  When I rang the bell for someone to come to the window the young guy turned around like he was annoyed to be at work.  I'm looking like dude, you don't have any customers, and you didn't have any customers when I left earlier, be glad you have a job.  This McDonalds is the worst ever.","2/17/2017",2
"McDonald's","It's rediculous! I ordered my children cheeseburger happy meals and they gave them cold frys and a cold burger but what really did it is the fact that my daughters burger had two top buns for the top and bottom. I am beyond mad","1/12/2019",0
"McDonald's","Best McDonald's I have ever been too. I never even noticed it has no indoor seating. I have been going to their drive thru consistently for almost two years and it's lightening fast, hot, and fresh every time. And it gets better. I eat a no carb diet; and every employee I have ever encountered at this location is SO accommodating about even the most ridiculous special orders. Tonight their service prompted me to write this review. I ordered a chicken patty no bun and a double cheeseburger no bun. They placed my chicken in a cute little space saucer like container with a big lettuce leaf. It was like getting a grilled chicken breast from a sit down restaurant. My boyfriend ordered FIVE mcdoubles with veggies and no bun and no sauce. And sure enough they served him a sizzling tower of ten little patties with crisp veggies. And all of this for 10 bucks. They even charge for a patty instead of a whole sandwich which some locations like to be difficult about that. This particular location makes me see McDonald's in a new way. They literally cook you dinner.","7/18/2015",1
"McDonald's","Surprisingly a very nice McDonald's. There is no lobby but 2 drive thru lanes. The staff is very friendly. Make sure you ask for condiments and napkins or you will by disappointed when you get home.","9/5/2015",0
"McDonald's","I am soooooo sick of this place. Save your time and money and go to the one just up the road at the corner of Garland Rd and Jupiter. This location sucks. It's right across from my work or I wouldn't have given them so many chances. I always get breakfast and you would think it would be a no brainer. I order an extra side order of bacon, which SHOULD be 2 full pieces. Most the time I probably end up with about 1 1/2 and all in pieces and cold. So cold the grease is solid on it. GROSS. Why serve something they wouldn't eat themselves? I also order an extra syrup while at the ordering box And they read it back to me. Being in a hurry I don't check my order assuming they got it right since they read it back-NOPE. If you need any specific condiments, Order them when they hand you your food. Its the only way you Know you're going to get it. I have seen these same results for 2 months now and I Finally totally give up. I never have a problem with the one on Garland Rd and Jupiter. I will just go there from now on. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY AT THE 9403 GARLAND RD. LOCATION!!!!!!!","8/31/2016",1
"McDonald's","Hello this is my review of mcdonalds.

You all know how it is, McDonald's is only good if you're really hungry and nothing else is open.

Unfortunately the 2 mchickens that I ordered did not make my mouth orgasm.

The fries are always consistently good but you always don't feel 100% after you eat something like this considering it's all the lowest quality ingredients stuffed with hormones and other harmful chemicals.

I give it 3 stars because I was really hungry at 1am and there is nothing else open near me at that time.

Thanks I love u","3/8/2019",1
"McDonald's","This review is based on the night time experience only. The day crew totally rocks and they love me. But after dark the employees here don't give a damn and talk to you in the most disrespectful ways.  The owner operator must not care as long as they're making money.

"McDonald's","Going to McDonald's, I never expect world class service, but golly gee willickers this McDonald's really provides the worst of the worst service... I placed a mobile order, and when no one came out to deliver to my friend who was picking the order up once we confirmed that we were there, I placed a call to inquire only to be HUNG UP ON. I know this is fast food, but if Chick-fil-A (and even the likes of places like Burger King and Popeyes) can deliver good service, then so can McDonald's. No matter how hungry or drunk I am, I swear I will never eat at this location again.","6/4/2021",4
"McDonald's","I literally just got this app to tell you not to get this McDonald's. I went in to get 3 McFlurrys stood there for about 15 minutes before getting served even though multiple staff members saw the line of costumers. (McFlurrys were only filled about half way too) Went through the drive thru a few days later when I realized I hadn't asked for ranch so when they gave me the food I asked for ranch. I was rudely told I gave you sweet and sour which was responded with a yes I know but can I please have some ranch I will pay. The lady then continued to shut the door and what looked like a lock and walked away. Waited about 5 minutes after and she never came back. Worst McDonalds I've been to terrible customer service.","6/9/2021",3
"McDonald's","This McDonald's has one of the worst people on the planet they are so stupid I went in  to order lunch and one of the three dollar a menu  I told the lady at the counter what I wanted and she kept saying what I told her at least four times what I wanted. She still cannot hear me I was talking as loud as I could with my mask  and she still cannot hear me. There was nobody in the restaurant though it wasn't busy well she cannot hear what I was saying. I walked out because she is so slow and stupid you shouldn't have to yell your order.","10/18/2021",2
"McDonald's","Not like it's fine dining but having to stand at the register for more than 10 minutes while making eye contact with the manager and a couple other employees several times as they talked and laughed with the other employees ignoring me was a little frustrating.

"McDonald's","We don't often eat at McDonald's but today I decided to. Also, this was the closest one to the store I was going to. I should have gone past it like my first mind told me. There was an insect leg fried onto at least one of my fries. My fiance took the fry it was found on into the establishment and while he was attempting to speak with the manager she cut him off and advised she would only refund the fries since he didn't have the rest of the food. Which we threw away bc IT COULD HAVE HAD ADDITIONAL INSECT PARTS IN AND ON IT. Not only should I have gotten a full refund for possibly having ingested insect parts in the rest of my food, he should have been treated better. I normally wouldn't come to yelp to complain but the number at the bottom of the receipt for compliments or complaints is out of working service. I'll also be reaching out to the health department.","3/11/2020",1
"McDonald's","I'm telling you McDonald's seems to be getting worse every time I go in. I went in at 9:00 and they were barely busy yet no one came to take my order and all I wanted was an OREO McFlurry yet no one came. They were also super slow to get my dad's order together. It took like over 10 minutes.","10/2/2019",2
"McDonald's","I've been in this line with only two cars in front me for20 minutes!!!!! This is ridiculous!

"McDonald's","There are so many McDonalds in this worlds, skip this one. I am 99% certain they did something weird with my food. Apparently, I upset the drive thru order taker when ordering a standard menu item.

I wanted a salad. No, I didn't want meat in this salad. Yes, I want the standard dressing that comes with it. Extra cheese.

When I received my order and thanked the girl, I got a, Uhhhhh huh and slammed window.

The salad looked suspect/very messy  and not a shred of cheese. I went inside and returned it. 3 girls, including the one from the 1st window smirked, whispered and watched during this entire transaction.","7/24/2017",2

They told us we had to get it in the store  secondly once we got there, no one helped us, they weren't busy at all, just laughing it up until I yelled out for service. I swear to god if they didn't pay attention for another min I would've walked up n gotten my sauce n leave  DO BETTER YOU ALREAD GOT 2.0 STARS BRUH","1/6/2020",2
"McDonald's","Went in today for a double cheeseburger  fries and a coke and waited for about 30 minutes before I went up to check in my order. When I went to the cashier the manager asked me what I needed I told her I wanted to know where my food was. She told me that they gave it to someone else.  I wasn't happy about that so I had to wait another 45 minutes just for them to make my order. After this visit I will not be coming back. I decided to come again on Mew Year's eve and again it sucked after waiting  30 minutes for my order to be taken I left. There was only 1 person doing everything and they were mostly doing drive tue orders. Dint come here because it sucks.","12/31/2019",2
"McDonald's","This McDonald's is terrible. Charged me for 2 sausage and egg mcmuffins but only gave me 2 sausage mcmuffins. What a ripoff! I didn't find out till I got home! Employees won't give you ANY sauce even if you ask for it, so make sure you check those to-go orders. They should look for a way to replace all their workers here with machines. Then maybe we would get instructions relayed!

I tried to call to get this fixed, but no one picks up the phone. I guess they don't bother. No need to bother if you're McDonalds, I suppose. Take your business to another McDonald's.","12/22/2015",1
"McDonald's","Snack wraps? Amazing. Delve a little further? Okay. Salsa Roja grilled chicken snack wraps sans the green pieces you people call lettuce. A delectable little nibbler not on the radar of McDonald's commercials nor their websites. A regional thing? Maybe. I'm not tight with Ronald so I don't know. Maybe you know. If so, here's a thumbs up. Also good? The Chipotle BBQ grilled chicken snack wrap, bag the leafy greens. It's dumb good. Together they cost you less than three fiddy.

Apple pies are also stupid tasty and you get a twosome to make a threesome with you for like a buck and a quarter.","5/13/2009",4

"McDonald's","I went here this morning, had breakfast, the counter people were nice and the area was pretty clean, my complaint is I got into an argument with a cock-eyed homeless man who was upset I took too long in the restroom after a few words he said he would take me outside and whip my butt, the whole restaurant was looking and the manager came and basically said to calm down and he spread us apart I was leaving in the first place but it just seemed odd that who actually went to console the homeless person as if he was the #1 patron in the restaurant. That really rubbed me the wrong way, because the homeless person started the argument and the manager appeared to side with him.","3/18/2017",1
"McDonald's","This was the most enjoyable experience I've had at a McDonalds in a long time. The person that took my order at the counter was very friendly.

I can't remember the last time I actually got nice hot French fries.","12/4/2015",0
"McDonald's","A bunch of morons working at this location. Repeated my order 4 times and they still didn't get it right. NO customer service; charged me for an entire meal I didn't get. No napkins, no condiments. Skip this one... unless you like morons that can't do simple tasks.","10/31/2016",1
"McDonald's","There are a few of these places around and, generally speaking, they offer the same quality at each location. 

The french fries are crispy and golden. A little on the salty side, they go great with a coke. 

They have this sandwich called the Big Mac. It's their main sandwich. 
Essentially it consists of two beef patties, cheese, and a special sauce. I like to get mine without onions.

Their fountain coke is wonderful.

If you're into American fast food, you should try this place. 

To my knowledge, they don't take reservations or have valet. But who knows. Give them a call and see.","1/5/2010",0

How do you screw up five orders in a row?   So today I call and ask for the manager and talk to Korina and explained the situation and the past history.  She could have cared less and said if I wanted the items I should order them again thru Uber Eats.  Long pause and then I explained to her for the third time they've screwed up the last five orders, why would I do this to myself again?

I had to pull up & wait on my food, the Manager brought my food out I told her I requested bbq & buffalo sauce & was they in my bag she said as she was walking away they put ketchup & I don't know what else before I could check she was already back in the building I didn't have the buffalo sauce & the drive thru line was too long to go back thru & because of the Covid Crisis I couldn't or wouldn't go in. My meal really sucked without the sauce. So sad this was a Manager you supposed to lead by example. She was an older hispanic lady with glasses & her hair pulled back.

I had to ask for it again and she finally gave me only one sauce and closed the windows quickly agin. So then I asked for more and she only gave me one more. Only one more. And closed the window and turn around quickly and walked away from the window. Over all the lady in the second window wasn't friendly at all.","8/11/2018",0

"McDonald's","Babayyy. Let me tell you. I haven't order anything aside from a Caramel Frapp or a $1 chicken sandwhich in literally years. Today, I had a ways to walk to get to my car sonI stopped and the McDonalds down from Baylor Hospital to get a drink. Maybe I was dellusional from the migrain caused by a massive toothache and I ordered the Buttermilk Crispy Chicken Sandwich NOT knowing it wasn't al all like the $1 Chicken Sandwhich. It was on a Hawaaiian/Brioche type bun and was a substantial chicken breast with cooling tomatoes and lettuce.  I died and went to Chicken Shack Heaven on a Hawaaiian bun!","7/17/2019",0
"McDonald's","Worst Customer Service !! the manager has a smart ass mouth & making unnecessary comments to customers when customers where responding politely. I have worked in the fast food industry before myself and I have never seen workers act a fool & so uneducated. On top of the fact that she was very unsanitary not only did she move from touching food to packing orders and touching money. Very unsanitary. I understand people have a bad day but no need to take it out on others, sometimes this is the reason why physical altercations happen with workers.","8/28/2022",0
"McDonald's","They don't care. I understand everyone is short staff because of easy resources. It's still not okay for poor services at all. Fries are soggy and salty. Burgers were made earlier because you can taste it and also the middle of the burgers were cold. Don't get food from here. Every place just need a change in management.","12/26/2021",0

"McDonald's","This location is inside of wal-mart which makes it convenient. I like how you're able to see them making the food because it is a small place. Do not dine in as they never clean the tables. Great place to grab and go. Also if you thought McDonald's was stingy with their sauces this place takes the trophy for it. Before you even ask for any more sauce they tell you this meal only comes with one sauce ok?!....I didn't ask for anymore.","9/6/2018",0

All they do is hang up. How rude and unprofessional. If this didn't happen I would have given them 5 stars","8/25/2018",0

"McDonald's","This is the BEST McDonalds to visit in the morning! I've gone through the drive thru many many times on my way to work, and they are SO FAST! I wish I could remember the name of the woman who works the pay window because she is especially awesome! She's quick-thinking and so so kind. I've visited other McDonalds locations in the mornings and there is always some hold up, takes time to get through the line- up to ten minutes or even beyond. But this location will have you ordered and on your way in just one or two minutes. 

I can't thank them enough; this location is the only reason I've been able to eat breakfast before work- or at all in the day- multiple times. Thank y'all for everything you do","6/16/2022",0
"McDonald's","WHAT!?!?  I see all of the recent bad reviews, but I haven't had a bad experience here since the mid 90's.  Yes, I'm a LONG time customer of this location. Might even be the oldest...

What I love best about this location is they can customize my orders and be able to handle the pricing and not screw up the rest of the order.  Sometimes I don't want slivered onions but want lettuce instead or maybe tomato slices!  The other 2 near by Mc D's fail at that, HORRIBLY! 

Thus I keep coming to this one, like on my last visit.  I wanted a simple Double Quarter pounder with no onions and add lettuce and tomatoes. No problem at this location!  (okay, wasn't going to share, but why not, you guys won't tell my doctor... I asked for 2 extra cheese slices on it, too :)    )   

I also had a few items for the others I was bringing to the house.  All but one had customizing.  All were right as ordered.  

Love this location and they always seem to be in the right wearing of their COVID PPE.  I'll remain a loyal customer.","11/2/2020",52
"McDonald's","One of your employees (Tristan) broke into me and my coworkers cars and tried to use my card at Wingstop and also at this location! May 8th...

"McDonald's","A zero review if could. Went to the drive-thru after Thursday Night Football about 10:30 which was 10/17/19. Of course the car in front of me ordered chicken sandwiches which slowed the line down as they don't want throw those out. Now me, I simply came for a few cheeseburgers and a quarter pounder. OH MY GOSH I've NEVER had a more OVER-COOKED, STALE and OLD burger from ANYWHERE. More than a half CENTURY... 50+ YEARS... Just STUPID!

I will NEVER come back to this location as it apparently has an inept manager/owner that does not know how to hire apt employees that think for themselves or care about the product going out.  More so, they obviously do not train the staff correctly in general. DON'T serve an OLD, STALE PRE-MADE frozen burgers!

I basically just thew a $10 bill to my neighbors pit bull... He didn't seem to mind but I don't eat DOG FOOD! He didn't like the pickles... :)

"McDonald's","Worst McDonald's to EVER GO TO AT NIGHT. The Night Manager is extremely rude, she doesn't even give her real name out. My bf ordered 2 Travis Scott meals and a simple 4 chicken nuggets with some sweet & sour sauce. All of our food was cold AS HELL. Fries Halfway done, burgers not made per order. No sauce Whats so ever & DONT EVEN GIVE YOU A RECIEPT. Tried calling to leave a message for Gm & they message box is too full. It's so sad that she somehow got that position, so many younger hard working bilingual actual adults working there that would do way better than the piece of junk woman in charge at night there. I will be coming for her job because it's McDonalds it should not be so damn hard to give fast and efficiency to people. Like we already getting cheap food, why do we deserve such bad service too just because she sucks at what she does. OH & everytime you've got a problem with your meal she comes up with the most dumbest excuses like da food cold because we have big line and everybody want the same thing......Soooooo that means you serve cold food to customers when the line isn't long? Ohhhh lordie lord she needs Jesus. I want a follow up with this too!","9/11/2020",1
"McDonald's","Always semi-rude and careless.

Always try to total me out and send me to the window before I'm done with my order. (I pause to give them time to catch up and they assume I'm done.)

They ask what kind of toy for happy meals.. Like... Idk, got any Hatchimals or a Furby?

For the most part, they're just not friendly here.

Edit: I had to go back because they forgot to give me my happy meals (honest mistake) and the lady at the window was more than hospitable and apologetic.  So I've given 3 stars instead of 2.","10/11/2018",0

Second, I talked them into serving me some bacon but they couldn't get the order right after I explained it four times. It's a bacon egg and cheese McMuffin. But nooooo--too hard to understand.

"McDonald's","I usually run by this McDonald's and get the oatmeal & tea before I go to work.  Last week the girl asked me to wait.  So I pulled up and waited & waited.  9 cars drove by me with their orders and the girl finally came out and gave me my order.  I complained that 9 people got their orders and that I wouldn't pull up & wait again.  Two days later she asked me to pull up and wait and I said no.  They gave me the oatmeal.  I waited a week to go back.  Today I pulled up and immediately she (the same girl) asked me to pull over and wait.  I could see the oatmeal on the counter and there were no cars behind me.  I said why should I pull over because there is no one behind me.  She asked me again to pull over.  Obviously this is personal.  So I asked for the Manager and she finally came to the window.  Still no cars behind me.  I explained everything and she said she would talk to her staff.","10/5/2016",0
"McDonald's","I never write reviews about anything, whether my order is messed up or whatever, I realize mistakes happen, so I live with it. It's not worth my time, nor theres. But tonight, I went to this specific restaurant, through the drive-thru, and order 2 bacon cheddar mcchickens. I was the only car in the line. After paying, I waited for the food to come for at least 5-10 minutes. It seemed very excessive for being the only customer. Nonetheless, the food came, I checked the bag, and it had my order, so I drove off. When I got home and unwrapped the sandwich, I found that there was no chicken patty in either of the sandwiches I ordered. Everything else was there: bacon, lettuce, mayo, and obviously, the bun. How do you leave out the chicken?? Just pure laziness. It's one thing to mess an order up, or something minor, but to forget the main part of the entire sandwich, the meat itself? This is ridiculous, and can't even believe this could happen. But people don't surprise me at all anymore.","2/25/2014",0

"McDonald's","I think this location must have changed management recently. I live nearby and have been coming to this location for the past 8 years. It USED TO BE GOOD. The staff was friendly, the drive-thru moved quickly & the food came out hot & fresh.  

Beginning in Oct or Nov 2022, this location has REALLY gone downhill. The last few times I drove through, the employees all seem like they are in training, and the food is more on par with Jack in the Box. i.e. The fries are limp & cool, the burgers are room temperature and seem like they have been sitting a while. I'm very disappointed this close to home location I may not return to.","12/11/2022",0
"McDonald's","Slow service and dirty dining area.

I was at the hospital across the street and decided to grab something different from the hospital food and usual dining spots nearby.

I ordered through the app thinking the food and coffee would be ready by the time I arrived. However, that was not the case at all.

You have to let them know you're inside through the app. Once there, they supposedly have the order ready to hand it to you.

My coffee was already on the hand-off bar but not the food. It was with several other drinks that were just sitting there and I had no idea.

It took nearly 10 minutes once I arrived before my order number was called out. The order was incomplete and had to ask and tell the staff member about the missing hashbrown and coffee. She then pointed out to a coffee sitting there. During this conversation, another customer cut in to ask about her food. 

The other customer was already inside when I arrived so she had been waiting even longer. 

Anyways, I wanted to eat there but every table was dirty and the smell wasn't quite clean as it smelled of cigar smoke? and damp cloths. Their hand sanitizer was broken and I did not want to enter their restroom. 

I was very weary of the food  because of this. I went back to the hospital and threw it in the nearest trash bin. I just could not eat after seeing the conditions inside the restaurant.

I ended up purchasing cafeteria food instead.","9/24/2021",0
"McDonald's","One star is generous. I didn't expect top tier customer service at 12:00 am but I did not expect piss poor customer service either. After having to repeat our order, no joke, 6 times for it to still be wrong. After informing the employee we are missing items with the drive thru window barley open, the employee screamed across the kitchen,  TELL HER TO GET HER ORDERS RIGHT and had the worst attitude ever towards us, then turned the missing items from our order as if it was our problem. I can assure you after repeating our order 6 times, I didn't forget what we did order.

"McDonald's","This location is in a high pedestrian area downtown next to multiple major hospitals. Deciding to treat the nursing staff to breakfast, I placed a 20 item order the app and walked the 1/4 block. The options given when paid were pickup or delivery. After payment it gave the options for Curb or DriveThru. I choose Curb and it immediately changed to DriveThru. I walked to the first window where the Mgr. looked at me clearly not happy and with a flick of his pin pointed to the second window, another man was being served on foot. I waited as now an impromptu meeting/argument the Mgr now at the 2nd window and opens it and begins the rant to scold the handicap man and myself, said we needed cars. We were lucky he was serving us. I kindly tried to explain that the app had forced drivethru. Again he with a flick of his pen directed to me repeated that we needed a car, then asked if we had cars. He told us to go to the front door then made the handicap man walk back to the drive thru. The Mgr. name is Ace. I was here 2 days prior in the morning and was impressed with the two managers an African American man and Hispanic woman. The store was slammed and they had everyone on a upbeat cadence. I would say that Ace should take lesson however as he said I'm not trying to be rude severely times, clearly it's just his natural character to be rude and offensive. I definitely wasn't lucky to be served by him or have to witness him abusing his authority with the minority women or getting his jolly's on picking on a handicapped man, who actually offered to pay again, as he couldn't remember if he had paid. Ace again yelled at him this time to leave as if he were a pigeon causing a nuance. Hopefully Ace will find a better suited job and one he can be happy at, instead of venomous. Possibly away from the public and certainly not in a leading capacity. I hope the Store Manager can rid this bad apple pie and be successful with the others that have the same mission.","4/10/2022",0

What I received... 30 spicy nuggets and a medium fries! Where's the other 10?! Wasn't that complicated of an order to get wrong. Goes back through drive thru. Promptly ignored. Calls store goes unanswered. Goes home. Gets on McDonalds website to act like a Karen and complain - today (2/25/21) received a complimentary gift card for a free meal.

"McDonald's","I ordered a couple breakfast meals w hash browns. They told me to pull around to the front of the restaurant and they'd bring my food out. Ten minutes later, I pulled back into the drive thru and they said it'll be ready at the window. Ten minutes later, my food finally comes out. I couldn't check my order in the car because I was now running late to work. When I got to work, there were two missing hash browns and I got a chicken sandwich instead of the sausage biscuit I ordered. Mind you, it was not busy at all. Three cars tops at most. I get this is McDonald's and therefore we have very low standards for them, but this was beyond unacceptable. What should've taken maybe 3 min, took 20 min and it was an incorrect order.

My only complaint is that they send large trucks into the small waiting spaces which are hard to  back out of, especially at lunch. And when they tell you to park at the front, it's a driving area with only space for 1 vehicle. This should be closed if it's going to be a waiting spot for your food.

"McDonald's","This morning (5/18)  I ordered a sausage and cheese biscuit with a hashbrown. I have ordered this many times at my home store, so I was rather surprised when my order total was 6.69.  When I approached the drive thru window, I kindly asked the employee about the price of my sausage and cheese biscuit. The woman working the first window snapped at me Its always been that way. I then assumed they had charged me for a sausage, egg, and cheese biscuit instead of what I ordered. When I tried to explain to the employee that my order was wrong, she would only repeat your total is 6.69 As someone who has worked in the service industry for many years, I am well aware that everyone makes mistakes and occasionally has bad days, but I can honestly say I have never, ever received such hostile treatment from anyone in the restaurant business. I have never felt the need to alert an employer to the actions of a single employee, but this woman's condescending attitude, unfriendly demeanor, and blatant belligerence caused me to leave the store extremely frustrated and sad that ANYONE would have that little respect for other human beings.

"McDonald's","Why did I just find a hair-tie with brown hair in my bag of food. I understand that you pay for what you get. It is in no way my hair-tie. I have black and blue hair and my sister is a blonde. This is absolutely the worst McDonald's I've ever received service from, the service overall was mediocre. Please, do better.","1/4/2020",0
"McDonald's","Possibly the worst McDonalds I've visited. Waited in line over 20 mins to over just to be handed the wrong order. Attempting to take the order back to the register was an additional hassle. The young man behind the counter was alone during a rush. In which he dropped the cash register. Bummer. At this point an additional wait followed. Actually just handed someone my order. I will wrap this up saying that I've now been in line for 27 mins for the second time. I guess things can only get better.","12/5/2018",0
"McDonald's","Best. Mcdonalds. Ever. The welcoming staff was really nice, the establishment is spotless and the food was great! On top of that, Ivan really helped me out by letting me run across the street to handle some business at Baylor hospital after my meal without the fear of being towed. This restaurant is the gold standard of fast food!","10/5/2018",0
"McDonald's","They have recently remodeled and it's lovely as far as McDonald's go. Service is great as well, employees are polite and my order is always right.","4/26/2017",1
"McDonald's","This McDonald's in particular is garbage. Simply because of the parking situation. Me and my wife took time to go into the McDonald's and have breakfast. She went to her doctors appointment and I shorty followed. Wasn't gone 25 minuets came back and our car was gone. As I was coming out another car was getting his car towed and he had a bag of McDonald's food with him! I told him to get in his car they couldn't tow his car with him in it. Another gentleman ran up and asked if there was a problem to the tow truck driver. There's a guy there all the time undercover to report cars to get towed!!! McDonald's doesn't call them in he does. And his company gets paid every time that happens that's a bit predatory. I went in to talk to the manager and he informed me I was pretty much SOL. I will be reporting both business to the BBB. I have attached a photo of the very kind gentleman that makes money hand over fist for his tow company, I sure hope he gets a promotion soon!!!","3/1/2018",0
"McDonald's","Reading the recent reviews of other McDonald's lead me to realize I should review my neighborhood McD's.  This review will mostly be based on costumer service.  I come to this location maybe once a month or so, but more for drinks or ice cream, and sometimes breakfast, but that's about it.  Their coffee is good, the iced coffee is good (and cheap), and the hot fudge sundaes are good too.  In this past year and a half, on every single one of my visits (through the drive-through) I have had the friendliest service.  Everyone smiles, everyone is happy, everyone says thank you, and they all want me to come back again.  I'm not sure what they put in the water at this McD's, but they need to pass it out to everyone, because there are some happy folks working at this place.  ;)","8/18/2009",6
"McDonald's","This is the absolute best experience I've ever had at Mcdonalds. We have eaten here two days in a row while a family member is in the hospital across the road. Even though they have been busy both times the store is spotless!!! The customer service is just amazing. Everyone is so friendly! I would highly recommend this place.","6/14/2017",0

"McDonald's","We stopped at this McDonalds on our way home-My daughter just had a baby at Baylor and it was like 5:50am and we were tired.  On the mike the guy was joking and playing a lot in the drive thru and he was repeating Everything we said like are you sure that's what you want attitude--when we got our order, 1st no receipt.  2. The order was messed up- We ordered 2 McGriddle's, 1 Mc Griddle with egg and cheese, 2 hashbrowns and 1 cup of coffee--We had to pull to the front because the coffee was not ready and then when he brought out the order he took the sack and drove off thinking all is there.

Upon getting almost to the freeway, reaching in the bag- there's only 1 Mc Griddle with egg and cheese, 1 hashbrown and no sugar or napkins at all.

This is very disappointing because the order was like $16.19 and we didn't turn around aftering being at the hospital for over 10 hours.  Make sure if you go that early in the morning, check your order/sack before you leave.  Nice area but bad service.","9/8/2018",0

"McDonald's","This is the 2nd time in a row that my order has been wrong!!  Both times, the cashier window confirms my order, then when I go to the pickup window, I get home and it's not even close. Today I got someone else's order, so there's somebody out there with my order.  I hope a manger sees this.  Worry less about speed, and come up with a process to make sure the orders going out of the pickup window is correct.  Whenever I ask for no onions at this location there's a 50/50 shot that they get it right.  It's always on my receipt, but there nobody checking details.  Attention to detail!!!","10/13/2017",0
"McDonald's","Super friendly cashier named Kimberly makes each visit here so pleasant. Always good food and service!
Drive thru always moves smoothly. Come here often because it's close to work and home. Get approached by the usual homeless person but that is all too common throughout Dallas.","12/12/2014",0
"McDonald's","I found myself lost in the aroma of the sizzling sausage and fluffy pancakes. The combination of maple syrup and hot sausage created a symphony of flavor in my mouth. Truly an out of body experience.","7/30/2017",0
"McDonald's","!!!!!!BEWARE THIEVES WORK HERE!!!
If I could give this location 0 stars I would. This has to be the WORST McDonald's location that I have EVER been to! Go through the drive-thru and normally someone would say thank you for choosing blah blah blah but not at this location!They are so unique you have to scream your order (because they can never hear you) at least 3/4 times just for them to hear you.. And Not to mention how rude they are once they repeat your order. 

But I had a young African American girl take my payment at the first window on Sunday the 17th of June, and when I handed her my payment it took awhile to get my card back and then when she does hand back my card she has got her phone in her other hand! My instant feeling was she took pictures of my credit card and was going to go online shopping later that evening! so when I confronted her about it I was demanding to see her photo gallery to prove she didn't take a picture of my credit card. But when she pulls up here photos, age just kept showing me her Instagram galley. So at this point, I got a manager involved and the manager just looks at me like I'm stupid and she points to the cameras above the first window. And she was refusing to listen to me nor did not want to help me. So I eventually was fed up with both of them and they REFUSED to give out their corporate information! So I went ahead and contacted corporate about its employee is stealing peoples credit card information through the drive-thru.

I have gotten to the point I no longer want to visit another location EVERRRR again!!","6/19/2018",0

"McDonald's","Why do your workers have long, ghetto fake nails? I don't want that in my food. Also, don't cut me off in the middle of my order to tell me my total.

"McDonald's","Worst location I have ever been to. They messed up my mobile order twice in a row. First time I was picking up in the drive thru,  got my receipt from the first window then rolled up to the second window to have them tell me they didn't have my order. I told them I just got the correct receipt from the girl at the first window. The manager came up and grabbed the receipt and told me to pull up and wait. I waited about 15 minutes for my food. No apologies no thanks for waiting nothing. Just handed me my food and walked off. I tried again tonight, again picking up in the drive thru. Pulled up to the first window as instructed and they couldn't find my order. I showed them the app and that the store and everything was correct. They still couldn't find it. I was able to cancel the order and then gave him what it was. The manager said I couldn't order at the window and that I  had to drive back around to order. I just left.","6/11/2019",0
"McDonald's","I'll go to this location over the Fair Park one any day! Have gone many times, but most recently went on a night where the manager was training someone new. They were both very courteous, and I got my food in record time.","2/7/2018",0
"McDonald's","Gosh, where's the management in this place? For over a month they had two wobbly tables in this joint that wasn't repaired in a timely fashion. Even had signs on the tables for people not to sit at. The signs disappeared and people were forced to sit at them when the place was 
filled with customers. Had someone spilled their hot coffee BECAUSE of the wobble they would have had real trouble winning the lawsuit. Good management takes care of the smallest of details. That's WHY Disney is so successful.
Now as I'm typing this the damn shake machine sounds like it's ready to die. What an annoying noise. Again, WHERE's someone to FIX this damn noise in a timely fashion?
It will probably last until Halloween when some McWitch will fly in on a broom to FINALLY fix it!
Yep, it's ALL about taking CARE of the smallest of details.","5/25/2016",0
"McDonald's","Seriously, I've waited so long I think I got a yeast infection. which means I can bake a bun faster before they can make a sandwich. Seriously, when you got a hankering for some fries, go buy some potato seeds, plant it, harvest it, water digg out those potatoes, skin em, Fri them, oh go buy a deep fryer, get your hair.did, salt, and you have fries before you get these fucking McDonalds fries. Seriously, screw this McDonalds. No, really do that, because they would last forever. A lot longer than my boyfriend, at least. Not like that Spanish guy  I met in the bathroom earlier tonight. He said he would call, I'm still waiting, if you're out there,  Alejandro, please call, I'm pregnant.","10/25/2013",1
"McDonald's","I hate this McDonalds with a thousand white hot stars.  They have screwed up my order or served poor quality food every time.  So often that I drive out of my way to avoid them.  In an act of desperation and forgiveness I tried them again.  I ordered a large Sweet Tea.  I did not realize I needed to specify ICED.  I just took a huge swallow of HOT sweet tea.  Yes, the two cubes should have been an indication, but I was thirsty.   Grrr!","12/6/2013",1
"McDonald's","Seems like new management, and for the worst. Food is worse than it should be, and everytime I ask for breakfast late night they say it will be a bit of a wait or they are not doing breakfast cause they are short handed.","9/20/2013",0

"Whataburger","Horrible location lines are always long but they also move extremely slow especially in the morning when ppl are on their way to work. The dining room doors are also locked in the morning even when they are supposed to be open. Lunch time they move slow found a wood chip in my burger once shouldn't have came back after that. Will be calling corporate to let them know of their inconvenience to their customers.","10/21/2022",0
"Whataburger","Without exaggeration it took an hour to get through the drive through line. Incompetent employees who gave me a cold patty melt with the cheese definitely not melted. If I could give 0 stars I would. In a word service was pathetic","12/17/2022",0

"Whataburger","I'm really sad to write this. I love Whataburger and can no longer get it where I live. So on a recent trip to Texas, we popped into this location. What a disaster! The place was filthy! And the customer service was really really bad. Thankfully the food was just like I remember it, but that's not enough to get this review up.","11/28/2021",0
"Whataburger","Wish I could give it zero stars. Waited over 30 minutes for a meal that never came. When asked for update they said meal was given to someone else. They said they were remaking it now. Waited a few more minutes, still nothing. Asked again for update, said they were working on it. I said forget it, give our food to a homeless man. Out $16 and all we got was a lemonade. 
A lady came in while we were waiting saying she's been waiting over 40 minutes in parking lot for food and demanded her money back. Several people were complaining about how long it was taking for their food. On my way out I started telling people to turn around and go eat somewhere else.
This is very unacceptable. How can a restaurant run so poorly?","7/9/2021",2
"Whataburger","This place esta basura. Don't even think about it or even stop. Move on. Took me 30mins to get an order and was told we don't serve no breakfast right now. It was 2am and they were too busy I was told. Bad management, rude employees.","11/29/2021",1
"Whataburger","Oh crusty dusty cracked lip Boi told me flat out No when I asked for ketchup and was dead ass. Also waiting in line is like getting the Covid shot at fair park.

"Whataburger","This location doesn't even deserve 1 star!!!  They have the most illiterate non caring employees!!! I've only gone here because my son loves whataburger and its closest to my house. They have the worst attitudes including the management!!! Went tonight and not one dang thing was made right except my drink and it barely had ice in it...fries were cold and hard. And I don't know how it literally took each car nearly 15 minutes to get an order I was stuck in line for 45 minutes...not going back after this","1/6/2022",0
"Whataburger","I won't be back here, the owners seriously need to see what's going on at this location (secret shopper). A tall guy was at the counter and took my order. He then proceeded to wipe down tables and not help anyone else. Then he started handing out ketchup and plastic ware and didn't wash his hands. They forgot my gravy but I expected nothing less since everyone waited 20 mins for their food. I understand it's busy but when you see staff walk that slow and make it clear they could care less about their job. The employees need to find a new one if they can't do what the job requires. ((TO THE EMPLOYEES))
WHEN YOU GET FOOD FROM OTHER ESTABLISHMENTS, I hope they won't treat you how y'all made everyone feel/felt in these reviews. Ill be doing that survey on the receipt with detail concern.","8/1/2021",1

"Whataburger","Employees talking to one another cursing out loud and when we walked in to dine it took 30 mins to get our order and when we received it the fries weren't even fresh they were cold while the whole time employees in the kitchen stood around looking in the lobby.

"Whataburger","Everything about this place is so bad, you're better off waiting for a table at Texas Roadhouse. That's how long it takes them to do anything such as, take orders, give food, etc. 
Also, they are extremely rude, no hello, no thank you, no have a good day, nothing. 
They also don't give out any condiments or even ask if you want any. 

Anyway, it is best to stay away, trust me.","5/22/2021",1

"Whataburger","Impatiently taking drive-thru order... told her we have 4 people to order for... She kept asking,
DOES THAT COMPLETE YOUR ODER?! After every meal that was ordered. What was she in such a hurry for? We spent close to $30 so quit rushing the customers. It is SO RUDE to interrupt a customer who's ordering. It's like we had inconvenienced her even though it's dinner time.","2/17/2020",2
"Whataburger","Me and my friend went there last night, (Buckner, 03/15/21) and after giving our order and waiting for 25 minutes, (not kidding) in the drive-through, when we drove up to the window where you pay and collect your food, the cashier said that he had never received our order.  He never said he was sorry and he had a very nonchalant attitude about the matter. So we drove away and went to McDonalds and in under eight minutes we received our food. 
 I have been a patron of your chain for more than 45 years but after last night I will not be giving you any of my hard earned money.  P.S. for the third time the shake machine was not working...again.   Goodbye and good luck.","3/16/2021",1
"Whataburger","Do not eat here. Food was cold, which is illegal to serve for food born illness reasons. They were handling fries and money with the same gloves. Very inhospitable with junk everywhere. The drive thru must be an hour long wait, because my wait inside was 30 minutes and I saw three cars leave. Plenty of staff, but all they do is walk around in circles and take breaks.","12/13/2021",0
"Whataburger","I'm trapped in your drive thru and can't get out because you have a god damn guard rail to prevent people from leaving. If you don't have the staff you close the place, you don't keep it open and trap people in line, never coming here again. I'm also not paying for the food, i would rather drive by and go somewhere else than give you dumbasses any money.","7/17/2021",3
"Whataburger","Horrible service they take forever to take your order and not only that the employees are so lazy you can hear it in there voices that can hardly  talk and are very rude I don't know who hiring these employees but who ever is they need to be fired because they hire people that don't want to work I understand it suck to work at a fast food restaurant but at let put a little  effort .","9/13/2021",1

"Whataburger","Their customer service is the WORST, employees are so slow and lazy you can literally hear it in their voice. Their attitude is the WORST when you ask for anything, it can be as simple as asking for extra sauce. How do you expect to work here but everything about the job bothers you. Management needs to do a better job at training their employees.","10/26/2021",0
"Whataburger","Trash customer service.  Trash management.  This was my first time EVER at a whataburger and I didn't even get a simple order of ONE burger.  A single burger took them ages and I simply ran out of time. I asked for a refund and left.  They should compensate me for the time they wasted.","7/7/2021",1
"Whataburger","Me and my boyfriend just went to this place and when we were about to order when the girl told us they were not accepting drive through orders only online orders. We saw people inside the restaurant placing orders so we decided to go inside to order and the girl told they were only accepting drive through orders. My boyfriend told her we just were in the drive through and they told us the opposite. So she told a coworker to deal with us. He said go to the app and order my boyfriend asked him then why is people placing orders inside the restauran and people eating here? So the employee had the audacity to say  So you want me to kick me out? we decided to leave. Right after we left the employee put the trash can to avoid people to come inside the restaurant or maybe us. Its not the first time we have had experience things like this at this particular place. I will never go back to any whataburger in my life. I used to work at a restaurant before and never treated people like this. If it was up to me I could give a 0 to this place.","2/24/2022",0

"Whataburger","Awful!!!!! Do not go to that location !! I ordered from drive thru. I ordered specific burgers and I got charged for all the extras. Only to come home to some basic sloppy burgers.

"Whataburger","Have gotten my order wrong on last two visits even though I repeated 4 times. Called in and was just hung-up on. Call back several times and it just goes to voice mail. They don't care.","7/16/2020",0
"Whataburger","Why is this the lowest rated Whataburger in Dallas? For me the staff cannot listen or do not listen. They have a real problem LISTENING and getting orders CORRECT. They are friendly but that does not fix the fact that you do not get what you order. Simple things like I want lots of ice in my drink. I told them FIVE times tonight EXTRA ICE at the order board and at the window. What did I get absolutely NO ICE they do this so often that I'm sure they are doing this on purpose. Or possibly they do not like ice. Perhaps Whataburger should close this one down to save their reputation.","10/29/2019",1
"Whataburger","Ordered from the All-Times favorite menu; can't go wrong there. The A.1. thick and hearty burger is just fantastic. Of all the burger joints, fast food or otherwise, this place is the bee's knees. 

The patties were, as the name implies, thick and hearty. The bacon and onions were both cooked to perfection and lay gently atop the aforementioned thick and hearty patties. 

The fries are outstanding! Ask for them to be double fried and they'll be the best crispy fried you've had. Be sure to get the spicy ketchup and shovel that condiment down your gullet. 

Overall, Whataburger is where it's at! Go and enjoy.","12/3/2016",0

"Whataburger","I understand they seemed to be incredibly busy for a Monday. No greeting or at least a hello when there was at least a person at the front. I just came here to redeem a coupon but I was really dissatisfied by this visit. The cashier was like what do you want? And just thought it was fine to be passive aggressive. After she finished typing my order aggressively onto the register which was supposed to be a #1 only mayo only lettuce only onion with the purchase of drink and fries. It should've only been 4.50 but when she told me the total was $12 I was like how? She replied what do you mean how? With the same rudeness. I told her I only wanted one burger but she rang up one and a whole meal. No apology but instead finds it ok to blame it on me for not being clear. I do have some empathy at the very least because I have been in her position before but her attitude was very unwelcoming. And after all of that she wrang up a completely wrong burger without the modifications I asked for originally. I told her this was wrong and she said well that's what you said . Then manager came and patiently wrang up the correct burger for me. The fries were really hot and the remade burger was really good. Even though there was no salt on the fries for some reason at least the random salt and pepper the cashier threw in my bag made up for that. Will I come here again? Probably not. Is there food good enough to come again? Yes. Is it fast? Took a little over 5 minutes so they have a moderate to high wait time. All in all a borderline decent experience.","1/18/2021",0
"Whataburger","A manager in today decided I wasn't of any importance. She kept overlooking me, gave my order to someone else. When I asked her about it she looked st me like I was bothering her.

Cause the short one is rude af!!!","8/6/2018",0

"Whataburger","This has got to be the worst Whataburger in Dallas. The teenagers running it are so rude and inept. We stood in line for 15 minutes (with no one in front of us) and all the employees just stared at us. Then I asked if someone could take our order and a boy fake took our order and walked away. He sent some girl over to us and she said can I help you? Like we didn't just order...And I said are you serious? And with all the attitude in the world she said can I help you? And I said obviously not and we left. She called me a bitch when we walked out and two of the male employees tried to fight us in the parking lot. SHUT THIS LOCATION DOWN.","3/3/2020",1

"Whataburger","Problem 1: gave out same number 51 to 3 people in a row, including me.
Problem 2: filled 5 orders after mine was placed. When I inquired, it was because they were waiting on jalapeño biscuits.

Problem 4: biscuit was partially frozen
Problem 5: drive thru blocked by delivery truck

"Whataburger","I had a reward for a honey butter chicken biscuit and I asked for a sweet tea as well. I asked the employee named Nymyria to scan my reward. She did, and then she proceeded to charge my card. I received my receipt and I had paid full price for my meal when I should've only paid for the sweet tea. She did not bother to tell me that the reward had not gone through. I was in a rush for work so I was unable to speak with a manager but should not happen to anyone else!!!!!!

"Whataburger","The food itself is the same quality you would expect from Whataburger. The service, however, is sub par. We went through the drive thru and got someone else's order, they charged me for the taquito I was supposed to get free through the app and then, because my wife and I were trying to hurry to get to work since waiting to get our correct order pushed us to our deadline, we failed to realize that they had not given us our entire order. We called to complain and the manager told my wife we would get our order for free the next time we came. We went in a few days later, and my wife was told that nobody by that managers name even worked here and that my wife's name had not even been taken. I understand some people game the system to try and get free stuff but this was ridiculous.","10/2/2017",3
"Whataburger","My order was wrong so I came back and after waiting in the drive thru for a while, I decided to read the reviews on yelp.... well that AIN'T good. So while I was reading I decided to just get my money back and visit another location. AVOID THIS LOCATION LIKE THE PLAGUE.","5/8/2018",1
"Whataburger","I do not recommend this Whataburger if you are in a rush. I sat in the drive thru for about 20-30 minutes and when I received my food the toast was no good and I was missing condiments . They took so long cars behind me were honking.

"Whataburger","Corporate should shut this store down. I love whataburger, I grew up on it. My dad built them back in the 80s. This location is an embarrassment to the family name. Do not waste your money or your time. It has bad service, it's filthy, they employees are not trained properly or they are just stupid or don't give a shit. They never get your order correct and the food is always cold. There is no excuse for how horrible this store is ran.","6/30/2017",1
"Whataburger","Possibly the slowest service from a WAB I've ever had, and they certainly aren't short staffed. Truly disturbing note: one male employee came out of the bathroom playing with his lip (piercing maybe?) but hands inside mouth. He walked into the kitchen, in full view, didn't wash his mouthy-fingers again, just slipped on gloves (small victory) and went to touching food. 
Painfully slow service. Probably will not return to.","9/21/2014",3

"Whataburger","When I crave Whataburger I go out my way to avoid this Whataburger. Haven't had a single good experience at this Whataburger. I highly doubt there is a worse Whataburger. I would have overlooked the lack of customer service if my food came out decent, but it only got worse. I ordered large fries and was shorted. My burger was carelessly prepared and the meat was stale as if it wasn't made to order.","4/23/2019",0
"Whataburger","Waited 45 minuets for my food and everyone who came in before us got their food before I ever got mine I went up three time and finally got my order.

"Whataburger","This is the most trash whataburger ever literally 90 percent of the time they screw your order up you're waiting 15 mins for ur food only to get a cold burger drenched with mustard you didn't ask for. Seen a dude take out trash and then try and bring me food with the other hand. You get you food in hopes of going home to what you ordered only to get home to half of what you asked for. Then you take it back and they try to compensate with free Apple pies, when I just wanted a hot meal and one trip to the restaurant....So many bad experiences here bruh.....","12/30/2017",1
"Whataburger","By far the slowest Whataburger I have been to, and I eat at Whataburger OFTEN. I love whataburger, I HATE this one, When I go through the drive thru with only two people in line it's at least a 10 minute wait. This is fast food, I understand they want it to be fresh but if whataburger s in other areas make it happen in less time this one should too. It's also one of the only ones in this area.","10/28/2017",2

"Whataburger","I he worst whataburger I have been too. 30 minutes to get a burger is a bit insane. Save your money and drive further. Customer service only applies if your pants are below your knees. VERY BAD EXPERIENCE..","4/20/2018",1
"Whataburger","This may not be the nicest neighborhood, but I was hungry and needed to use the restroom while on a quick break from a jobsite in the area. I was pleasantly surprised at the helpful, positive attitude of the ladies working here today. While I was waiting on my to-go order, a gentleman walked in with his order that he had picked up at the drive thru because it was incorrect. These gals replaced his order without question or issue, as it should be. I can't say that the bathroom was the cleanest, but the pleasant attitude of the employees was very nice to see.","3/24/2016",1
"Whataburger","If you could rate something a negative star it would be this place. It all started when we ordered our food. Nothing special just a couple of burgers with one that only needed pickles and mustard. After a few times of ordering we thought we were home free. Little did we know it was all just getting started. After 15 minutes of waiting, the single car ahead of us finally got there order. We were up and ready to enjoy my favorite fast food burger. The check out lady immediately was confused of our order and made 4 orders hoping one was right. It seemed as if everyone in there is lost. After we finally made it out we were ready to eat. The fries were white and still very light colored and cold. They didn't seem to have been near a deep fryer in a while. The burgers were sloppy not the quality one is use to. Needless to say the manager said they can remake the food but I will never return to that location. I seen it had bad reviews and gave them the benefit of doubt. This place shouldn't be allowed to call themselves WHATABURGER. Something should be done.","2/15/2018",1
"Whataburger","This has got to be the absolute WORST Whataburger in the system.  The fries are stale and cold, I mentioned to the manager that there was no fizz in the diet Coke, she claimed there was even though I was shaking the cup and no fizz.  Can you imagine my surprise when I took a drink and it was FLAT?  Avoid this place at all costs!","12/6/2018",0

"Whataburger","One of the worst fast food places I've ever been to in my life. No pride in their work! If I pay $7 for just a burger. I'd expect it to be semi decent & mine was barely edible!!","8/7/2017",1
"Whataburger","I normally don't eat fast food...my hips and butt don't let me...but today at lunch had to do what i had to do....This Whataburger....was extremely clean...the staff was friendly, came by to offer condiments and napkins...truly friendly not faking it....and it was lunch time!!!!

I was extremely impressed!","3/26/2010",1
"Whataburger","I just left whataburger because I was starving and in a hurry to get to work. I went through the drive thru and got a kids grill cheese. I am 21 years old but I don't eat much when it comes to fast food. I get to work and open up my food and one half of the grill cheese looks like it was just made and the other half looks like it's been sitting out and had bite marks in it. I was very upset!!! I do not recommend going to this location. It's not a good neighborhood either.","9/6/2016",2
"Whataburger","Ordered a number 1 with meat and cheese only and they repeated that back to me. I got a number one with lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, mustard and no mayonnaise. Thankfully they charged me an extra 75 cents for large cheese. Never ever order from this location.","12/28/2016",1
"Whataburger","I eat very little fast food, mostly because it's not very good. I've not eaten the junk at McD, BK, or PH in over a decade. But, I still make an occasional trip to WB and JitB. This WB is off the list forever.

It's the closest one to my home and I've been there often, but the service and environment have declined in the last few years. They went from never messing up an order to messing up about half of them, and now the place seems to have degenerated into a full-blown ghetto nightmare.

The ill-mannered, completely idiotic lump of flesh that attempted to take my simple order was the single most incompetent anthropoid I can recall dealing with. She could not remember anything I'd told her and made me repeat the order 6 times in a surreal scene.

The staff was incredibly obnoxious, yelling obscenity-laden, mostly-unintelligible jabber while having great difficulty running the place despite it not being especially busy.

One idiot dragged an overflowing trash can out of the kitchen, rudely running all the customers out of his way, then stood there in the dining area all bewildered, then dragged the can back to the kitchen. Not sure what he was tripping on.

The final straw was when I looked up to see another loudmouth ghetto mama licking her fingers, as if reading a book (yeah, that's rich), when separating slices of cheese! Yes, you read that right.

I tricked her into handing me back my $20, informed everyone in there that I'd never dream of eating anything these mega-losers prepared, and traveled a short way north, over the highway, to Jack in the Box and an acceptable fast food experience, far removed from the New Jack City nightmare up the road.

My girlfriend, waiting in the truck, was not surprised when I emerged from WB empty-handed. She said the parking lot was like a zoo during the 10 minutes I'd wasted inside. So was the inside - the customers were as nasty as the staff. It sounded a lot like what I'd guess being in prison would be like. There's nothing like watching a drunk 300 lb. ghetto goblin in a size 10 dress and HILARIOUS bad wig scream about nothing for several minutes.

I've been all over the world, all over America, and all over Texas. This experience was so outstandingly deficient that it was fascinating and fun to witness, so long as none of their food came near any member of my household.

Travelers who lack street smarts and preparedness might want to avoid this place, especially after dark.","2/6/2014",2
"Whataburger","Repeated my order three times at drive through.  She apparently wasn't listening.  Went to the window, repeated the order. She still couldn't hear.  Repeated again. She got it right. Told me no biscuits, it would be five minutes. Had me get out of the drive through so she could give another customer their order.

"Whataburger","I've eaten at this store since it opened in the late, late 90's. And while I love the breakfast sandwiches and they have the world's best biscuits and gravy, they've lurched way down the ratings pole for several reasons. I probably go in at least twice every week or two, and the place is always half-clean or just plain dirty. Greasy salt and pepper shakers, when you can find one at a table, are always a mess. I've eaten lunch when it was packed, and yet with six, seven, eight employees the floors and tables are covered with debris and food. (You should see the men's room!) I just don't understand why a restaurant has to be dirty, and for a company that doesn't franchise but owns every last store outright you'd think they'd be concerned about that. Burgers are frequently served on cold buns, the luxury of having hot fries is spotty, and sometimes the meat is just so-so. Whataburger has a long legacy of being -- allegedly -- Texas' favorite fast food chain, but they've been resting on their laurels far too long. I've called them out on this before but nothing changes. At least the former manager, David Williams, never tolerated this place being dirty. Sad that just isn't the case with the current manager.","10/17/2017",0
"Whataburger","I have had two bad experiences at this location. First time around I went through drive thru. All was well till I drove off with out my change $40. I went right back to get it and they said I had to go back the following morning. When I went back the cashiers drawer for that shift was actually short. The damn cashier stole my money. Few years later go back to this location. I'm with my wife and friends. Late night, dined in. As my friends and I debate on what to order, one of the employees boyfriend comes at us and tells us that we hit his truck. No possible way as we parked a good distance from his truck. He disrespects my wife and friends and rushes up to me. We wrestle and have a few swings. The bull shit cops finally show up give me a ticket for assault, and allow the fat asshole go free with a pad on the back. Also the employees tries to keep my iPhone, some how they found it out of the blue. I called Corporate the next morning and they said that there was nothing they can do.","7/18/2015",0

"Whataburger","Wow... Flip a coin. Heads, great service, clean location and perfect Whataburger food or Tails, horrible service, missed items for your order and food that goes to the trash. 

I'll talk about my last 2 orders.  One call in and one drive through.  

On the call in to go, it was to feed 8 hungry people (half were kids) for breakfast.  Thus 12 bacon and cheese Taquitos.  I asked for 12 ketchups and 12 mild picante sauce plus some milks and OJs.  Gave them 30 minutes to prepare before picking up.  I arrived, not crowded and the staff was very friendly and I paid.  Walked out to the car and for some reason, decided to check the order.  Milks were missing, less than half of the picante and no ketchup.  They apologized, gave me what I ordered and off I went.  Get home, get a couple of taquitos to the younger kids and screams of pain!  All of the taquitos had jalapeno slices in them!  We tried removing, but still to hot for most to eat. 8 taquitos went in the trash.  Called the on duty manager and sorry was all we got.  

Next trip for 2 Grilled Chicken salads from the drive through a couple of months later.   Perfect ordering through the speaker with the order taker repeating the order for correctness.  Get to the window, order verified, all items confirmed as they handed the bag to me. Get home and the salads were well built and ready for a photo op. Absolutely perfect and tasty.  

I'll be back as this one is better than the other 2 nearby locations which have horrible staffs and almost always poorly prepared meals.","10/27/2020",54
"Whataburger","If I could give 0 starts I could. The rudest staff in the world. I understand everyone has their days but this team was unhelpful and unnecessarily rude.

We ended up coming to a solution for an online order that couldn't be fulfilled but we didn't need to blame anyone or be aggressive, I was happy with any solution from the beginning.","2/3/2022",0
"Whataburger","How is it possible to receive an order at the counter and deliver a Whataburger and fries to the table in 3 minutes? Easy, cook everything in advance. That way the fries are cold, the cheese doesn't melt on the old patty. This Whataburger is one of the new breed, profit before taste. So sad to see what Whataburger is becoming.I didn't have the energy to get my 13.25 back. Just left the gross food on the counter and walked.","3/7/2022",0

"Whataburger","My worst Whataburger experience ever, and I have been to many over the decades.

Went for a quick (usually 5-10 minutes in the drive through, worth the wait) burger, rings, and shake on a Sunday evening.  Here's the timetable of my experience:

6:33pm:  arrive at drive through line (just one open- the other was blocked off)
6:35pm:  make order at audio window
6:38pm:  pay for food at first window
6:38pm-7:12pm:  park at window, waiting for the two cars in front of me to move
7:13:  (finally) move forward one slot
7:14:  pick up my order.  rings were cold, insisted on some hot ones before departing.
7:15:  exit

42 minutes at a long time to wait at Whataburger, when there are a total of five cars in front of you when you pull up.  At 7:08, running out of things to do while waiting, I asked for the manager.  He had not shown up yet, as of the time I pulled up 5 minutes later.  Pitiful.

I have no idea what took so long to go through this process, but I have no intention of ever returning to this location again, and recommend that you visit another location as well, unless you are a masochist.","9/18/2016",5
"Whataburger","My wife and I have been here probably 10 times and the service and food quality continues to get worse. My wife won't go anymore (hair in the food) but I keep going ... well it's  finally hit rock bottom. 

Everything is cold the burger looked like it was from yesterday and tasted that way too. The food is always cold ... anyone want a cold burger ? I didn't think so. 

With so many choices for Burgers I don't know how they stay in business if they choose to cook all the meat in the morning and then serve it up all day cold.","12/8/2019",1
"Whataburger","Hands down best Whataburger location in the area! The food always taste fresher then the other surrounding locations and they are by far the fastest to get the food out also! I come here every time even though there are ones closer to me! Please keep up the good work!","6/16/2020",0

"Whataburger","Okay... Call me a moron because I had a 10:30 pm craving for chicken and gravy. Well, maybe a few fries too. Let's call it a late dinner... I should of learned my lesson from prior attempts and other reviews...

This is the WORST place EVER! $8 down the drain, still hungry and lighter in the wallet. WASTE OF TIME, EFFORT AND GAS.

About 10:30 pm on a Saturday evening:

1) Drive Thru - 5/5 - Quick and attentive. order was correct.
2) PROTEIN - 0/5 - The chicken tenders must have been cooked more than an hour ago and sitting under a heat lamp. I ate 1 and a half... DRY!
3) Fries - 0/5 - Disgusting, stale, cold, greasy and limp. I attempted to eat 3 fries and spit those out...
4) Gravy - 0/5 - Tastes like packaged glue reheated over and over.
4) Parking lot - 1/5 - Pick-up your lot and pressure wash the pavement.

If I could give less than a 1 rating I would! Hideous and not eatable. A 24 hour restaurant and can't pull of a basic cream gravy, fries and freshly fried chicken. JOKE and needs new ownership or management.

My suggestion for the establishment: DO NOT BE A 24 HOUR PLACE IF YOU CAN'T PULL OFF DECENT/FRESH FOOD all 24 HOURS!

Just DISGUSTING and a waste of $. Now I'm still hungry and have to smell greasy fries in my garbage. I should have leaned my lesson by now and understand this is a HIT and MISS place. I seem to catch the MISS every time.","9/21/2019",0
"Whataburger","Best whattaburger I've ever been in.always courteous staff, clean and order is 99% right most of the time. If it's not right they always make it more than right. 
And lobby guy Herman is fantastic. Always nice and welcoming and makes sure everything is clean. 
Best fast food place around.","5/4/2017",0
"Whataburger","Worst experience I have ever had at a drive through. I pulled up to the speaker and my order was promptly taken. When I got to the first window no one was there. I sat and waited for maybe a few minutes and still saw no one there. Thinking that maybe I misunderstood, I pulled up to the second window and waited a few more minutes. Still, no one there. I saw one employee walk by the window and not even acknowledge my existence. Then I noticed the car behind at the first window was attended to. I just drove off at that point and got food somewhere else.","11/28/2018",0
"Whataburger","We've had a horrible experience here the last 3 times we've visited this location. Tonight, we pulled up to the speaker and were promptly greeted and started our order. However, the order was never finished and no one ever responded again. We pulled up to the window. They did in fact hear our order bc it was repeated to us. But when we got home the order was wrong. This is the 3rd time our order has been wrong. I can only blame us though for not checking the order before we leave.","9/17/2018",0
"Whataburger","Today my husband and I came to have a fast lunch! We had a coupon for a free Whataburger.  The order taker was not sure how to ring it up, as we also ordered a meal for myself.  He asked his co worker, she was not sure, finally the manager came over punched a couple of buttons and my total was over 10 dollars, using the coupon.  Ok, so I thought it might be a little high, since one burger should have been free with the coupon.

As it turned out, the manager charged us for an additional hamburger, never took off for the free burger with the coupon we used.  No time to go back and get it right.  Not happy with the service, as we left, someone was coming in from the drive through because their order was in-correct.","1/31/2016",1
"Whataburger","Not a bad experience yet. I've seen some pretty bad reviews which everyone may have different experiences and opinions, but the past couple of times I've been here it's been fine service. The staff here is very friendly & even reminded us to fill out the survey on the bottom of the receipt to get a free burger next time. The food overall was good! I will definitely come back.","1/4/2019",0
"Whataburger","I decided to swing by my local Whataburger, what a mistake!  The drive through cashier spilled a Coke on my hand and up the sleeve of my white blouse. While this is not a crisis, my complaint is the way he reacted. He proceeded to make fun of my asking for a napkin and being upset that Coke was on my white blouse. When I asked for a manager her response was a blank stare.  No one even offered a simple, so sorry...& that's not difficult.  While the manager was speaking to me at the window, the employee was in the background continuing to make fun of the situation with other employees!  Zero customer service & leadership.  I won't return.","12/9/2019",0
"Whataburger","We go here a lot because. Well it's the closest Whataburger. Everything I ordered is how's it's supposed to taste. It's ran by mostly kids to it's a little bit louder when dinning in. I recommend driving thru to escape from that environment if you're not used to it.","4/16/2017",1
"Whataburger","How do you truly rate a fast food chain? We all know what to expect from a Whataburger. After all, this is Texas and the state is littered with them. It's the same low grade fast food, we all have become accustomed to. Sure, it's better than McDonald's, but what isn't? 

What I can tell you is this location is always clean, the staff is friendly and even when it's busy, you food comes out quick, and isn't waiting for you under a heat lamp. We ordered burgers the way we wanted them (with this, without that) and they still arrived within three minutes, the exact way we ordered them. Basically, if you're in the mood for chain, fast food, this location shouldn't disappoint you.","2/15/2015",1
"Whataburger","Brand new store in the Timber Creek shopping center (NW Hwy and Skillman).
Nice and clean inside. Worst fries I have had in my life. Not sure if they were leftovers from the day before or not fully cooked, but they tasted stale and underdone. The burger was fine; the place is what it is.","10/16/2011",0
"Whataburger","I went to this particular whataburger today for lunch, and I must say I am very disappointed. I made a pretty simple order, #1 with cheese and no tomatoes. Doesn't seem like much, but I got my burger and it had a no onion sticker on it, yet still had onions and tomatoes on it. My drink was filled to about 1 below the top of the cup with ice, which of course you can't see until you're taking your second swallow and realize your drink is empty. Fries were dark brown and tasted saltless. Seems like this whataburger needs new employees or new management. Poor performance in my opinion.","6/2/2017",0
"Whataburger","Slow, slow slow. And, no napkins. FAIL Not that busy. But, no receipt and no napkins for drive thru? Come on Whataburger.","6/16/2018",1
"Whataburger","I hate to say it but these guys are slow and do not care. Been here several times and the service is so subpar. I wonder why I didn't go somewhere else every to I go, which is rare because service and food is blah. If the food was better, then it would be tolerable but it's not. Still waiting for my food....ugghhhh. To be fair to other Whataburgers, they should close this one.","12/20/2018",0
"Whataburger","I have waited, hoped things would straighten out, but!
This Whataburger is Honestly the WORST around!!!
If you see a person in front of you... leave. It will be faster to go to the Greenville Ave. location. If you see two people ahead of you they will screw up your order. And for those who think altering my order is the problem, No it isn't.
Just because you aren't allergic to say, Onions doesn't mean people aren't ! I AM

If it's going to take 18 minutes in a fast food drive thru ( 2 cars ahead of me. ) they could at least get my order right.

The employees  here have been/ are nice, which I do truly appreciate. So 2 stars for that.

  ( Exception, one manager who I haven't seen again.  Was  rude when I was mad that my chicken sandwich magically became a Burger.)

But the consistency of screwing up my orders is ridiculous! !!
 But,  I forget, and go back.","6/23/2015",0
"Whataburger","OMG... Just now..

Employee: what can I get you?

Me: I'll take the Patty Melt

Employee: A what?

Me: The Whataburger Patty Melt (pointing at the large picture of it right behind her face)

Employee: What number is that?

Me: I don't see a number it's called a patty melt.

Employee: oh I think I see it. What kind of sauce would like on it??

Me: how about the sauce that comes on it? 

Employee: Do you know what the sauce is called?

Me: I assume you guys call it the sauce that goes on the Patty melt?

This went on for a couple of minutes.

I mean, what in the world goes on at the training sessions here? There really should be a hidden camera and turn that video into a web-show... I'm betting it would be a comedy hit!

So ridiculous.. Pull your head out already.","10/17/2015",1
"Whataburger","There are two Whataburgers about an equal distance from me, and I always choose this one. 

Okay, that being said I haven't actually been inside... But let me tell ya, the drive-thru here is super fast. I've sat at the other one near me for 20 minutes for food and they forgot to give me back my debit card one time. That's never happened here. I think this is an as-good-as-it-gets Whataburger. 

I usually visit in the mornings on the weekends and the food is always hot and yummy and they've never messed up my order. Thumbs up!","6/19/2013",1

"Whataburger","Manager Doniel had the worst attitude that I've ever seen. I ordered some chicken strips which tasted like the meat was going bad. The guy at the register told Doniel and he caught an attitude. I asked the young guy to give me a fajita taco to replace the strips. I waited 15 minutes and still didn't have my food. I told the young guy at the register that if I needed my money back because I didn't appreciate Doniel's attitude. Of course that was an issue with him too. Never again will I go back to this location and I will let everyone know about what type of people they are employing","6/18/2018",0
"Whataburger","Went here today and well it's slow as hell in here. There is only one cashier and it took at least 30 minutes for the service person to bring out my food. The prices are ok for the food but the service could be better.","4/1/2017",1
"Whataburger","I went to Whataburger on 3/8/14. I placed a large to go order. When I got home I discovered a lot of inaccuracies with my order. I immediately called and spoke to the assistant manager, she apologies and states she will replace my whole order. I inform her that it will be tomorrow before I can come back in. We'll the next day I go in and speak to a manager on duty. After looking at my receipt the manager on duty proceeds to tell me that since it didn't happen on his shift it wasn't his problem. This shift manager then begins to tell me everything bad about his assistant manager. Their appears to be serious problems with their management teams. Nevertheless, it is extremely unprofessional to belittle your manager to your customers. 
As a customer this will not be a place I chose to eat at in the future.","3/9/2014",0

WTH!!!  If the dining area is this blown out and the staff don't care, then I wonder how clean is the kitchen???  I expect better from Whataburger!!!","2/27/2016",0

"Whataburger","This location is absolutely terrible. Every single time I go to this Whata, they mess up my order. Cheeseburger with mustard, ketchup and pickles. Not difficult. I keep going back because it's less than half a mile from where I live. When I informed the guy at the drive thru my order was wrong he said,no it's not. That's what you ordered. I would never order the works on my burger. Most of the workers are visibly stoned. Usually I don't care, but at least be a functioning stoner. Done with this location.","3/8/2015",0

"Whataburger","This location has always had mediocre customer service but the food was good and ready when I decided I was hungry at 2 in the morning. But this recent visit was terrible. Cue the disinterested voice taking our order, all seems normal. I pull up and felt bad for being the asshat wanting to break a hundred on a $20 order. The girl helping us, Christine, looked at the bill and said really? just before snatching it out of my hand. Okay, my bad? Minutes later she gives me my change with no receipt. The food follows soon after and she doesn't ask if we want ketchup or anything. Whatever, I just wanted to get home. The bread on our burgers was old, my patty was super dry, and they tried to get away with giving me unsweet tea and pouring sugar in it instead of just saying they were out. Come on, guys. Sugar in a cold tea, you think someone wouldn't notice that. I didn't want to bother going back that late. So, never again with this location. If you live in this area just go to the one on greenville. At least that location has SOME friendly folks and they're honest when something is out.","1/18/2017",0
"Whataburger","another bad whataburger experience.. different store same bad customer service.. manager was very distracted, waved someone to take our order rang up one item and then answered the drivethru and walked away.. once we finnally got our order taken we had to ask to have a table cleaned as the entire restaurant was empty.. but every table was dirty .. manager wiped one off then went back to whatever she was trying to do with some employee on a laptop.. eventuallly lap top guy got done and came and wiped all the rest of the tables with one hand while he texted with the other.. food was ok and the young man that delivered our food was very nice and helpful.. too bad he wasnt the one that waited on us. drivethru thing went off while he was delivering and he told them one minute and finished with us.. that was better..the original drive thru person that started to take our couter order was now on the lap top doing whatever trtaining thing the manager felt was the high priority over clean restaurant and taking care of guests... will not be back","9/5/2016",0
"Whataburger","Not really sure why Yelp has this place listed as closed.  I'm literally waiting for my order (along with about a dozen people) inside the store now.  Might as well be closed with how long the service usually takes.  You'll also know it's open because the drive thru consistently snakes around the restaurant in the mornings.

Otherwise, the food is about average for a whataburger, and the staff is generally friendly enough.  If you haven't been to a whataburger restaurant before, you're not missing much.  Just try a whataburger and maybe a honey bbq sandwich with chicken strips and gravy.  That's about it.

Edit: just got my order (2 chicken strips and a small fries) after 20 min of waiting, and they forgot my fries.  I get they're busy and most fast food places make mistakes, but it's a little annoying that my order was so small and yet still wrong.  Good thing I was still at the restaurant to ask.  Just a reminder to check your order before accepting, folks!","11/3/2022",0

"Whataburger","When in Texas, you have to try Whataburger, said the doorman at Woodys! So I asked my hotel shuttle driver if he was hungry and we agreed on Whataburger!

"Whataburger","The drive-thru line seemed rather long, so I opted to eat inside.  To my pleasant surprise, the food came out almost as soon as I ordered it.  I had two honey butter chicken biscuits, and they were delicious.  The consistency on food taste is what I come to expect from Whataburger.  I'll eat here again.","8/13/2022",0
"Whataburger","My friend from California had to try Whataburger before she left Texas! We went all out with the Junior Bacon Cheeseburger, Bacon Avocado Burger, Patty Melt, Lemonade, Onion Rings, and Fries...for two people, yep lol. 

First of all, both of us thought the onion rings were some of the best we've had from a fast food chain. They taste beer-battered?! The batter is so fluffy and crispy mmm. The fries on the other hand are average...almost taste frozen. But they're fries so we ate them lol.

 I can see why the Patty Melt is a Whataburger Fav - it's simple and delicious! Just a juicy beef patty, melted cheese, and buttery Texas toast - hard to go wrong. The Bacon Avocado Burger is like a boujee patty melt - surprisingly not much better than the OG but pricier from the avocado. 

The Junior Bacon Cheeseburger was basic. But Whataburger has a signature Creamy Red Pepper Sauce that can upgrade any burger, n is perf for dipping! Thanks always Whataburger!","7/27/2021",62
"Whataburger","Nice workers who all were working hard most people going to drive through. So busy even the security guard was in the back on the fry station.

"Whataburger","This place is terrible. Asked for specific food they give you something totally different. They dont follow instructions or orders. Dont go here they'll just mess up your order and give you something you didnt order or didnt want. Example I asked for their #13 which is s chicken strip basket dont worry they'll give you a chicken strip sandwich with cheese on it. I also asked for the # 5 which is the bacon cheeseburger dont worry they'll give you a patty melt. Get someone who is going to actually manage and make sure people get the right orders at least. This has happened multiple times now. Oh and just to give you a clear understanding that they cant comprehend orders or get them right they cant even get my drink right either. Simply asked for a water.. they gave me a sprite. This location is a joke.","12/10/2022",1
"Whataburger","Horrible, horrible, horrible. They will get your entire order wrong, leave out items that you paid for, and give you attitude the entire time. Would not recommend this location at all.

They do have different options food wise vs bakers but it's identical. My burger didn't look like the advertised version but the new peach shake is pretty good! Other than that it was alright. It'll be a good place to go when you got back from the bar or clubbing. That's it. Lol","9/26/2021",0

"Whataburger","This location really takes the fast out of fast food. If you can avoid coming here, I really suggest you do. I'm not one to leave negative reviews but we waited 35+ minutes in the drive thru for our food...THEN they forgot one of our sandwiches so we went inside and waited another 23 minutes to get it after telling 2 people. While waiting, I watched people in the back touch their hair with the gloves they were touching food with. Some of the employees looked like they were there for social hour and not for work. There was a lack of communication between them, etc. They all seemed inattentive. The person who took our order on the intercom was talking so slow like he was on something. The one who came to our car, also seemed out of it. All of our food was cold when we got it. A gentleman next to me had been waiting for his order longer than my 23 minutes, and everyone that ordered after him got their food before him. Turns out he waited 30+ minutes for an order of fries and onion rings... I applaud his patience. 

I was finally asked what I was waiting for by someone who looked like he was a supervisor or manager (?). He apologized, got the sandwich for me ASAP and gave me extra fries. If I was rating just him, 5 stars for customer service, but overall I am leaving my 1-star review. Hopefully, management will read this and try to improve things. Maybe I'll give them benefit of the doubt.. maybe it's not usually like this and I just happened to be there on an understaffed, overly-busy and stressful day. I'll give it another try one day, but for now, I'll stick to other, actually-fast, food.","11/14/2021",2
"Whataburger","I placed an order through the app for takeout (picking it up inside the restaurant). I walked up and there was a trash can in front of the door with the door being locked but there were still customers inside. A guy came and unlocked the door and said I had to wait in the drive thru for my order. Mind you the line was about 20 cars long. My order was ready and he wouldn't let me come in and grab it, wouldn't bring it to me at the door or in my car. This is honestly ridiculous. He said the app shouldn't have let me do it for take out since they close at 11 inside but the app did let me, which isn't my fault.

I went to this location to get breakfast. First off they had the first lane blocked with cones as to prevent people from ordering but the second lane was open so naturally I drove through the second lane to get to the first lane speaker. While ordering the lady was asking what else in a very rude tone after each item before I could even finish ordering the item. I ordered two bacon taquitos and received one bacon taquito wrapped in two separate tortillas. They were pretty much just small tacos.

We waited for another 10 minutes for the other sandwich. The staff did not seem to believe us when we told them they only gave us one sandwich. We watched as they continued to go between cars with incorrect meals and give wrong change to different cars. They didn't ask us if we wanted ketchup or anything. Incredibly disorganized, this place needs better management & needs to train their staff. The cheese on the avocado bacon burger was not even melted. The mushrooms in the mushroom Swiss burger taste like they've been cooked and bagged by corporate & distributed nationally - they're very squishy, watery, & overly salty.","11/14/2020",3

They don't deserve a single star, but I have to select at least one. I'm spreading word for people to pay in cash, then ask for your money back, since what a burger feels they should keep your coins.

WhataB has been slacking for a long time.","12/20/2021",1
"Whataburger","Slowest fast food restaurant I've ever been to. I came here a few weeks ago and waited almost an hour in the drive thru for my food. I've yet to meet one person who had a different experience than I did at this location.","6/19/2022",1
"Whataburger","Horrible. It's like every Whataburger has taken a turn for the worse. They used to be fast and have the best food. Now all of them, including this one are extremely slow and serve lukewarm, stale food. It's sad that a place that once had such an excellent reputation is now this pathetic.

This is a dramatic review; I know, but it's pretty accurate.","11/21/2021",1
"Whataburger","Another failed attempt at curb side delivery. Waited 15 minutes and still didn't receive my food. Had to go inside and get it from the counter. Why can't this place get their life together.","10/10/2021",2
"Whataburger","This location is the absolute worst Whataburger to visit. I went here for breakfast today and everything was horrible! I waited almost 20 minutes for old cold greasy food. The biscuits were hard the hash browns were limp and soggy, greasy. The sausage patty was old old. I was so disappointed with the food I trashed it and didn't bother requesting a refund. I won't ever patronize with this location again.","7/24/2022",0
"Whataburger","One hour long line (was stuck so couldn't leave).
Cold food not made with love.
Absolute disgrace to some other locations.

Need to clean house here and figure it out.

Never recommend.","2/1/2021",2
"Whataburger","This was probably my worst experience ever at any Whataburger in Texas. My wife had a #1 with cheese, fries were cold and stale. The cheese on the burger was hard and cold, the patty was hot and the lettuce was brown and soggy. There was no tomato and the whole thing was drenched in mustard....WTF!!!! I had pancakes that were surprisingly good but c'mon, how hard can it be to microwave pancakes. If you get that wrong you might as well close up shop. I also had 2 taquitos with cheese but of course one didn't have cheese. Is this what happens to quality when you're bought by a out of state company? Is this how big business treats its customers? Do better Whataburger.","8/29/2021",1
"Whataburger","I would give it half a star if possible. LaShondra has the worst attitude and my drink tastes like soap. Avoid coming here","5/9/2022",0
"Whataburger","Staff is rude from the employees to the manager's. In the drive thru ordered my food twice and the employee did not get my order, the 3rd she asked if I was going to order, I responded that I said my order twice. The employee responded back to me, that I should not have a f**** attitude with her. I asked her to repeat herself to be sure of what I heard. She just told my total and told me to drive up for my food. When the manager came to my window we had a few exchanged words also and after that I was upset so I told I needed her cashier's name and the manager and store number. She told me that she won't give it, so I asked to please be sure I get my receipt bc I know it will be on there. I asked for the store number, she gave it and I repeated it to be sure, the manager said back to me. You don't know such and such which was the store number I was repeating. After that rude comment I asked the manager to remove herself from the side of my car. She walked away saying rude things, still. So I parked and went into the store, when I went into the store more rudeness, from another different manager. I go eat there about 1 time a week, but I will no longer. Because no one apologized until I called corporate. A shame","4/9/2022",0
"Whataburger","AVOID AT ALL COST. Sat in the drive through for more than an hour after trying to get a quick meal at 1am after a long day. We were unable to leave since it was one lane only and could not drive around. Not only that, when we got our food it was COLD. So what is just sitting there for an hour....? Based on other reviews this is a common occurrence. Please report to the corporate office! This place needs a refresh of staff and management.","10/31/2021",0

"Whataburger","As a burger lover from the west coast, I found it a must to visit Whataburger whilenin Texas.  It stands out as a fast food option with a lot of personalities.  Its burger is way larger than In-N-Out and the atmosphere is less pretentious than Shake Shack.  The quality of the food is on par with McDonald's and BK (which is a good thing IMO) though I would've liked a bit more flavor.  The spicy ketchup for the fries is excellent though, and I ended up putting it on the burger as well.

The drive thru line took really long at night, even though there weren't many cars.  I don't think they cook burgers to the order so it made no sense to take so long.","1/23/2020",0
"Whataburger","I went in the morning very tired. i tried ordering some hubchubs however the staff was confused with my request. However I appreciate their patience as i recalled the common folk call it honey butter chicken biscuits, the most delectable precious food in the world.","10/2/2021",0
"Whataburger","This is simply the worst whataburger in the history of all time shitty water burgers. It is unbelievably bad.   What a Burger should doze this over and fire every employee here.   50 cutomers backed up, every employee standing around with their hands on their dicks, truly an epic embarrassment of a water Burger.   Fire the regional manager that thinks this is OK","9/19/2021",0
"Whataburger","I am a native Texan and I've grown up with Whataburger being my favorite fast food burger. This location is BY FAR the worst I've ever been to and gives the brand a bad wrap. Here's why:

1. The food is CONSISTENTLY COLD. Fries and burger.
2. Service is CONSISTENTLY WAY TOO SLOW.
3. The eggs in the burritos are always watery.

I continue to come back hoping things will be better the next time, but they never are.","1/30/2021",0
"Whataburger","Found a dead rat outside... See picture. But the food was good! If I saw the rat while I was eating my burger let me just tell you the food would have came right back up and joined the rat on the ground.","4/6/2021",0
"Whataburger","This is the worst location I've ever been to. I understand that it's hard times and it's hard to find workers but it seriously takes longer to go through the drive through than sit down at a restaurant. Will never again visit this location unless it's during the day when I can do curbside service.","7/26/2021",0
"Whataburger","I guess I love whataburger so much I keep putting myself through hell as this is the closest location. 

Order a meal and the guy who brought it out just handed me the bag, so I put it in the passenger seat and drove off. However just as I was about to hit the highway my spirit said, check the bag!!! I got someone else's meal - nothing in the bag was mine. 

So I go back and tell them what's wrong and they come back out with my food and this time I refuse to leave without looking and sure as you know it, still missing things. 

Yes it's lunch time, yes it's busy but I need y'all to do better!!!","6/13/2019",2

"Whataburger","It is currently 6 PM the manager on duty on July 30th 2022, i had received a call stating that i dropped one of my checks ($1100) that I had dropped im guessing either the parking lot or the inside an employee had gave me a call letting me know that they found and that she or he put it in the safe deposit box wherever that is kept. i called back asking to speak to the manager at 5:30 Pm letting her know that they can rip it up as it is no longer active, she was telling me im lying?? i have no reason to lying when there is nothing to gain from telling them to rip it up?? so.. i will be writing to corporate about this situation meaning the management is lying and trying to keep that check all to them selves??? anyways i forfeited it and they could have told the truth.. this location sucks and i will never be back!! i expect someone to get back to me about this the MANAGER on duty at 5:30 PM ON JULY 30TH 2022 is inconsiderate.. like I said i will be writing to corporate, game on bitches.","7/30/2022",0
"Whataburger","Man I wish I could leave 0 stars. 
DO NOT come to this location if you are in a hurry. The drive through line can take up to 45 minutes to get through. The worst service and lack of urgency. The food is cold once you finally make it to the window. I keep trying to give this place another chance but someone I only get more and more disappointed each visit. Please save yourself the time, money and stress and just go find another place to get your food, It's far from being worth it.","5/13/2021",0
"Whataburger","Since I am not a native Texan  I thought my indifference to Whataburger was based on my roots.So...I thought I would give them a solid try. After the last visit, I am done. 
After 20 minutes in the drive thru,  my food was brought to me and I drove on my merry way! Granted they were busy, but when I realized both my burger and fries tasted like they were made yesterday, that's it! How can the food be cold??? Not cool, or even lukewarm COLD! You can keep it to yourselves!","11/8/2020",0
"Whataburger","It's right in between McDonald's/Burger King/Jack in the box and a midsy restaurant burger like Denny's 

For the price it's good, it's similar to In-N-Out but in a lot of locations that they aren't. 

Try it. You'll like it for 3 bucks.","2/1/2020",1
"Whataburger","AVOID LOCATION.  You cannot get out of drive thru.  We have been sitting here forever and no one answered on the speaker in the drive through.  Literally, do not go through drive through.  You will not be able to leave.","11/7/2021",0
"Whataburger","Not sure why this place only gets 2 1/2 stars...

One of the best places to eat a great burger..order onion rings cooked to perfection. Iced tea sweet or unsweet best in town.

You want to talk about a great staff that is all about customer service. This is the place. Better service than many high priced places.

We will be back again for sure!","7/28/2018",1
"Whataburger","I've lived in Texas all of my life and this is hands down the worst whataburger location. The food is always gross and cold.

Save your money and go to a better location Bc I promise you you won't get what you pay for here.","12/6/2020",1
"Whataburger","I don't understand why everyone likes this burger place. I've tried it several times and I am unsatisfied every time. It's a basic greasy burger that you could make at home without any skills. I get it. It's fast food - not gourmet. But the way people applaud Whataburger makes it seem like it is the Holy Grail of cheeseburgers. Not for me *shrugs*","1/22/2020",0
"Whataburger","Drive thru took forever, not because there was a long line but because service was so slow. I was waiting for over 10 minutes to even though there was only one car in front of me when I arrived.

"Whataburger","I came here for lunch on a Monday.  Whataburger is definitely the main fast food chain in Texas.  Texans are very proud of Whataburger so I came to check it out.  I ordered the patty melt meal which came with a medium drink and French fries.  They give you a number sign and you wait for someone to bring you your order.  The medium drink size looked like a large drink to me but I guess everything is bigger in Texas.  The patty melt was okay, it was cheesy but bland.  The fries could be crispier, was a bit soft for the most part.  The spicy ketchup was very good, definitely helped with the blandness.  The drink was enormous.  I still prefer In N Out Burger over Whataburger since it tastes better overall.","3/26/2018",1
"Whataburger","Not really a review for the food as it was what you'd expect. But the customer service her was great, I brought in my great uncle and an older black woman was mopping the floor so I was escorting him across, then she came up and kindly offered to walk him to a seat. Very kind of her, just impressed with the service. Also I asked for a cup of water and within a few seconds two separate employees offered me a cup.

"Whataburger","Having lived in California for the last 6 years,  I've had to live with the glorification of in n' out  and how incredible it is.  I love their food,  but let me tell you,  it is no match to WHATABURGER! Because one you try this deliciousness,  all you'll be able to say is what a burger.

If you have the chances,  please dine in at least once.  You'll get the infamous number once you order (one which  every high school student has accidentally taken home a few times as memorabilia). Then you sit down and wait for the employers to deliver. 

For $0.79 more,  please do WHATASIZE your meal as you'll need to experience the heavenly fries.  When offered between regular or spicy ketchup,  be real,  and ask for the spicy. 

My favorite is the grilled chicken sandwich,  no butter in the buns,  with a good ol' diet Dr. Pepper. The Patty burger is also incredibly good to the taste buds,  and will have you singing its praise home. The chicken tender basket is a classic with its gravy sauce. 

Enjoy this darn good food!","7/30/2017",5

I asked for NO ONIONS & MAYO ONLY. they put mustard and onions on my burger & NO BACON. I had to remove the entire top with the mustard and onions and eat what was left with a knife and fork. Also all the food was cold. I don't recommend this location to anyone.","1/25/2019",1
"Whataburger","I'm very disappointed with the decision to give you a chance, but to start, the lady at the table next to ours ordered chicken nuggets and got a piece of bread.
I looked at Yelp and saw 2.5 stars and crossed my fingers for a change of pace and the mistake of a good burger.
As you may know already, I was let down. If you're hungry and looking for good food, Yelp typically knows where to send you. I too, am from California and I have never been more disappointed.
Don't waste your money or anyone else's. I will be here for a few more days. One restaurant will not see me again.","8/17/2017",0

Reasked.for splenda and got 1 one packet.  I just gave up on getting a straw or napkins or ketchup....and even though they wont miss me cuz their lines are long (30 minutes thru the drive thru).....I'm also giving up on this whataburger:(","3/3/2019",0
"Whataburger","I have always heard of Whataburger, but never tried it (obviously there are none I know of in Michigan), so when the club closes down and you see one and it's 24 hrs, that means I had to try it and I was impress. Just had a bacon double cheeseburger with fries . The burger was excellent, cooked right, and dare I say probably the best fast food/drive thru burger I have ever had. Fries was also very good as was their onion rings. Overall if it's late night in Dallas and you need something to eat, go here.","3/19/2019",0
"Whataburger","I felt so unclean at this whataburger. Few of the employees were wearing masks and absolutely no other patrons other then me and my partner wore a mask. The vibe was like a picture you look at and the longer you look at it the worse it gets. all tables open so there was no social distancing and the workers let a few homeless people touch the cups on the counter. They ended up just taking 3 cups from the cashiers counter and were touching lids and all over the counter. Another person came in asking for change for the metro and stole garbage bags from the trash. I ordered a plain and dry bacon cheeseburger and there were onions on it which I am allergic. I had already left the store out of fear of catching something so when I bit into my burger and couldn't eat it I just tossed it and left hungry. Id have done the feedback on website but the receipt doesn't have all the information required and order number was too large for the field.","8/8/2021",0

"Whataburger","On my flight to TX, I sat next to a resident and he said, If you like In and Out Burger, you definitely have to try Whataburger.

Being from California, I was really excited to check out Whataburger. Unfortunately I was very disappointed. Maybe it was the location I visited, but the burger sucked. It came out cold, the patty was dry, I couldn't even finish it, and I'm not one to leave leftovers. 

I don't know why Texans love this place so much. Maybe on a drunken night in the future I'll give it a try, but I'm definitely not going to give it a chance again.","3/2/2018",2
"Whataburger","I came here because every Texan I know rages about Whataburger. And I love my red meat so I was extra excited to get me some Whataburger.

The menu rages from burgers, to chicken, to limited time options, and breakfast in the morning. I went with the bacon and cheese Whataburger meal. There was nothing remotely close to hot and/or fresh about my food. Luke warm isn't even accurate. The cheese wasn't melted, I could taste the cold from the onions and pickles rather than the warmth of a cooked hamburger patty. Honestly, this may have been the worst burger I've ever had.

The fries were also a major disappointment. Once again, Tepid would be a stretch to determine their freshness. They tasted just like frozen French fries that were dipped in a fryer and sitting for over an hour. Too much salt too. Hello high blood pressure. 

The medium soda is sure to put you in a diabetic coma because it's the equivalence of a Big Gulp from 7/11. I'm afraid of what their large is. 

The employees were all quite friendly and clearly working hard which baffles me as to how I received the worst burger of my life. Clean store and restroom. I'm seriously so confused as to what happened with my food.

If it weren't for the clean restrooms, store, and exceptionally friendly staff, I would be giving this place one star. I will choose hot, fresh food any day over what I just ate.","12/13/2015",6
"Whataburger","I don't often leave reviews, let alone bad ones but I was beyond disappointed with the service. $30 spent for my family and not a single thing was right. They didn't tell me they were out of sweet tea which was the main reason we went until after I paid and the one drink we knew wasn't going to be sweet tea was wrong. Again, I had to write this review because I've never been anywhere that's screwed up this bad.","2/25/2021",0

"Whataburger","Quite possibly the worst service I've ever experienced in my life. 
I am only giving two stars because the service was so bad that it became entertaining. I haven't laughed that hard in a while. 

Doors do not open from the inside. 

24/7 my ass. They put up all chairs at 9:45 and close at 10PM.

"Whataburger","very disappointed - the staff was rude and very unconcerned about taking care of their customers... we waited almost 30 minutes for two burgers one order of fries and one drink - it was not until my husband asked for the manager and/or a refund we got our food... the inattentive staff was appalling - as they chit chatted and laughed with each other, customers were left waiting and irritated inside and both lines of the drive thru outside ridiculously long. you certainly should have fun at work but not at the expense of their customers... there are far too many places to get take out from in the area to tolerate such!","10/18/2020",0
"Whataburger","One of the worst experiences I've had in a drive thru at a fast food place! This place is always busy so they have 2 lines going all the time for drive thru. I was in the second line not next to the drive thru window and once I got my food, there was only 1 spicy ketchup in there. I asked the employee if she can get me additional 3 more spicy ketchup, she rolled her eyes at me and that's when I knew this was going to be bad. She immediately goes back in and doesn't come back for 5 minutes. She goes back inside without coming to my vehicle. She comes back outside and walks by my vehicle to where I had to remind her about my spicy ketchup request. She just oh yeah, just one second and proceeds to walk past my car and continue getting payments from people behind me. This took another 5 minutes, when I reminded her at the time all she had to do was turnaround and get it for me before. Once she makes her way back to the door I reminded her again, she looked at me, goes inside and comes outside a few minutes later with no ketchup, I had to yell at her again and she says there should some ketchup in the bag. Obviously there wasn't enough that's why I was asking for more smart one! The level of stupidity and lack of training was on another level, but what do you expect from a place like this!","5/3/2021",0

"Whataburger","I went to this whattaburger with truly high hopes. We arrived at 10:48 AM and were incredibly excited to enjoy the famed whataburger breakfast honey butter chicken biscuit sandwich. We ordered the whatameal, complete with hash browns and spicy ketchup and were enjoying a really nice meal complete with the ambiance of a fast food chain. That took a turn for the worst however when a fellow patron pulled his ballsack out and began strolling around the establishment. Not a single employee lifted an eyebrow as this man paraded around the restaurant. I quickly lost my appetite and we left shortly thereafter.

"Whataburger","First off the speed of service is fucking ridiculous... then once getting my food, the chicken sandwich I ordered with bacon didn't have bacon on it, I didn't get my straw for my drink, the patty melt burger was dry as hell, and not the taquitos were hard!! Like the tortilla bread was so hard you could take the taquito and knock it up against a door and it would chip into pieces.. now that's all while I'm still at the restaurant getting my food, then when I get home to open up my patty melt sandwich, why the fuck is there ants crawling around on the inside of the sandwich??????!!!!! Yeah I was so disappointed and disgusted I didn't bother to go back up there and wait in another 30minutes line just to get me disgusting food and crappy service, just know, do not waste your time or money at that specific location!!","7/12/2020",0
"Whataburger","The food is fine but the waits are always long. I've never been here and left after ordering food in a timely manner. Also had food missing from several orders.","7/2/2020",0
"Whataburger","bad service the person who took the order took it wrong did not want to give me my receipt the badly cooked food the lousy hamburger I ordered it with little mayo ketchup and mustard for the same meat over cooked and super cold cold bread and I was not given  correct order they took me wrong they gave it to me worse and I speak to report and they still bother

"Whataburger","There is nothing fast about this drive thru. I've never been to this place without waiting AT LEAST 20 mins in line. Tonight, about to hit 40 mins. Seriously feel like they should discount my meals for the gas burned just waiting to get it. Unfortunately it is the only whataburger around my house and my love is too strong. 

But seriously? Will it ever get better!!??","5/21/2017",0
"Whataburger","Literally the worst Whataburger. I've actually left without my food because they forgot I was waiting and it had been 45 minutes. The wait is normally 20 minutes and they are extremely rude. You're better off driving to a different location.","3/13/2019",0
"Whataburger","This was my first experience with this chain and it was a pleasant surprise.  Needed something cheap and quick and it was both AND of better quality than insert chain burger joint.  Was it the best burger I've ever eaten, nope but it was delicious and the fries were hot and crispy and they had a spicy ketchup that was dynamite!  Service was strong, saw a porter/buser help several people without being prompted- employees seemed happy and enthusiastic and they got my order correct.  Is there more?","8/7/2019",0
"Whataburger","A1 double bacon burger please!

This was my first Whataburger experience and let me tell you, Whatagoodexperience!

I came here late on Friday and was greeted by the friendliest representative i've ever met at any fast food restaurant. He was uber attentive and proffesional.

The food was also great, the burger was juicy and flavorful and those fries where excellent.

BIG FAN!","2/16/2016",3
"Whataburger","Service is incredibly slow. I had to wait 30 min in the drive-thru. Service when you walk inside is just as long. Food is Whataburger quality but when you have to wait that long, it's just not worth it.","2/29/2020",0
"Whataburger","Worst service ever.  I have been there a few times now and won't go back.  The service is incredibly slow. I mean incredibly. Every single time. It's fast food.  I could walk into a restaurant, sit down, order apps and a full meal and be serviced... and EAT... in the time it takes you to throw together a 'fast food' burger and fries.  The first time I thought I might have just hit a bad night but after two more attempts, never again.  The food quality is irrelevant once you're waiting over 30 min for a fast food burger.","11/29/2018",0
"Whataburger","Manager Fabian missed my food and wanted to return my ticket but decided to not give me my money back and snatched the food away from me I have never seen any Whataburger have this level of customer service it's truly ghetto and Fabian should never work at any customer service oriented job ever again. I called the police but the police doesn't involve in anything civil so that's that.  I'm truly disappointed of Whataburger which seems really weird because I always receive such an amazing customer service normally from other location.","11/10/2018",0
"Whataburger","After a Stars game and most all establishments are closed, and you have a member of your posse who needs food to walk straight, what a relief to find a close by Texas stand by who delivered the goods with courtesy, and expected quality you expect from a Whataburger at a late hour.   Hit the spot and so grateful!","11/8/2018",0
"Whataburger","This was my 1st time at Whataburger and I had the number 5 which was a Bacon Cheeseburger with fries.  The bacon didn't seem to be cooked well and half of the fries were cold.  The lines were long due to staff talking behind the counter instead of working.  The food especially the burger was average and the service was slow and unfriendly.","4/7/2019",0
"Whataburger","They confirmed my order 3 times at the drive through and still got it wrong. It's unfortunate that this is probably the closest location to downtown. I won't be returning. People.. drive the extra 5-10 mins to the next location to get your order right and faster.","10/31/2018",0
"Whataburger","I'm sorry but this Whataburger sucks and honestly the only reason it gets the business it does is because it's one of the few fast food places in the are so it gets business by default. I'm so over spending money on cold, over cooked, burnt, old/not fresh food. Not to mention the place is gross and it's sooo chaotic in there. After seeing who the manager is and her giving me something that was old I realized that if she doesn't care then why would her employees. Save your time and don't wait in a long line for crappy food.","9/28/2018",0
"Whataburger","I am so particular when it comes to customer service. I am always expecting nothing but EXCEPTIONAL customer service when I am dining out. This restaurant disappoints every time in this department. I just sat in this drive they line for 31 minutes and that is not exaggerated. When I finally made it to the order point the lady taking the orders was so rude and ghetto. There was no pleasantry exchange she just barked at me for my order. Once I stated that I wanted a chix strip sandwich she demanded to know if I wanted the meal or just the sandwich. I repeated my order chix strip sandwich she screamed at me again and said do you want the meal or just the sandwich? When I asked her to repeat my order to me and tell me what she thinks I want she went mute and had me wait over 6 minutes before she decided to proceed with my order for a chix strip sandwich. The whole experience was horrible. I didn't even bother to ask for a manager once I made it to the window. Surely there was one in there and the employees were still standing around not working. The fact that we are all waiting 45 minutes for sandwiches, fries and drinks is ridiculous. I will be making the drive to a different location if I decide to eat a chix strip sandwich in the future.","9/8/2019",0
"Whataburger","So, I ordered a 2 meals one with a chocolate shake. Whataburger was busy but not crazy. When I pull up to the window they tell me everything is ready but the shake machine is down and will be 10 minutes, which is fine. I tell them to forget about the shake and ask that my total be adjusted. After that, the lady at the window disappears and who I can only guess is a manager comes to the window with a very irate tone and asked if I payed at the first window. I say yes then he closes the window and throws my food in the trash. He comes back and points to the exit and says I took it off and closes the window on me. Needless to say, I wanted the other items just not the shake, at this point ive been in the drive thru for around 20 minutes. Then the first lady reappears and pulls my food out of the trash and acts like shes going to hand it to me. I refuse the food and she tells me they will remake it but to park because it could take a while. 
 Im in the food service industry and have been on occasion going to this store for almost 10 years, and Im not sure I would give this guy a job holding the door based on his attitude. But at the very least maybe some sort of grace or courtesy was in order and a loyal paying customer was shown the door(metaphorically). I was only stopping there out of connivence and an unwilling ness to cook at home after a long day. I will avoid this store in the future even after being pretty happy with it in the past.","10/21/2018",0
"Whataburger","In line for 30 minutes received a cold burger.  Not sure if the cook didn't show up and they were struggling inside. Everyone in line was mad.   Realize it's New year's Day but don't even bother to open if you can't have staff show up in service the public. But didn't think there were bad Whataburger's in the world but I would say this is the worst. Surprise their corporate people haven't seen the postings on this location and addressed with the franchisee or manager what the problems are here","1/1/2020",0
"Whataburger","I ordered the 3 pc. chicken strip meal.  The fries were cold from the start and I received unsweet tea instead of sweet tea.  The gravy wasn't even thick enough to stay on the chicken strip - had lots of water added to it! This is the last time I will go to this Whataburger.","4/9/2019",0
"Whataburger","Whataburger itself is always a 10/10 but this location is SO SLOW. Legit the opposite of fast food. The line is always wrapped around the building and they don't try to speed things up. If you're in a hurry try another Whata!","9/3/2018",0
"Whataburger","This Whataburger location is consistently the worst Whataburger I've been to (and I've visited a lot of Whataburger locations). I keep going back out of convenience, thinking that maybe someday it'll be better. Nope. 

The drive thru line always moves unbelievably slowly, and the inside of the restaurant closes at a certain time so you've no choice but to wait in the drive thru line. 

The fries ALWAYS taste like they were made yesterday, and the last two times I visited this location I got an entire side of 1 long fries. Like little french fry crumbs. I'm not even sure how that's possible. Sometimes the fries are so caked in salt that they're completely inedible. 

Recently, my boyfriend and I went inside to order food to-go. My boyfriend only ordered a side of fries. After watching 3 people (who ordered after us) receive their food, my boyfriend asked about his fries and was told they'd be right out. 3 more people get their orders and still nothing for my boyfriend. After 15 minutes of waiting I finally went up and said something. The cashier had to stop what he was doing to get the fries himself because the people in charge of preparing the food couldn't seem to figure it out. 

I don't know why I keep going back here, but I really wish they'd get it together.","8/4/2017",3
"Whataburger","Ordered a sausage BOB this morning and got a jalapeño biscuit with cheddar and egg only. This place needs a serious management overhaul and systems in place to assist employees with processing orders correctly.

"Whataburger","The manager and owner of this dump they call a restaurant should be ashamed of this place. Nobody working here gives a dam about their job or the customer. I guess the motto here is To HELL with customer service. This is literally the burger joint from hell. STAY AWAY!","1/9/2020",0

"Whataburger","Oh Whataburger, I try to let you into my life and you fail me EVERY.SINGLE.TIME. I have been to this location a handful of times. Each time, I order a  burger the way I want it. Alas, this is not Burger King because I consistently get it THEIR way.  With just a short period of time between appointments, I decided to drive thru for a quick burger and drink. Nothing quick about this drive thru. I ordered a Whataburger Jr. with cheese no onion and a small Dr. Pepper (see receipt photo). After 15 minutes sitting in the drive thru, I finally get my meal. A small Dr. Pepper over filled to the point that the lid was completely covered. No napkins provided, of course. After driving away, I open my burger for it to cool down. Upon unwrapping the burger, I immediately notice it is cold. I don't have time to turn around and go back, so I try to eat it. Upon first bite, I get a mouthful of onions. After waiting 15 minutes for a cheeseburger no onions and a Dr. Pepper, you think they would manage to get at least one of them correct or serve the burger warm. I've completely given up on you, Whataburger. You can keep your poor, slow-ass customer service and cold, shitty food prepared your way.","8/3/2018",0
"Whataburger","Clean indoors, amazing service.

"Whataburger","For some odd reason (we get it's late and y'all are probably under staffed) but the line at this place takes WAY TOO LONG. it's ridiculous for the service that you get. Put out hiring sings, recruit... so what you need to do to keep a business running. I mean damn.","10/28/2018",0
"Whataburger","Came in for breakfast not very busy in here, the counter person brought me my Taquito on a tray no napkins no utilities no sauce I ask for sauce she went right back to the counter and never brought it I had to get up and get everything myself.

"Whataburger","OMG, I LOVE Whataburger, it is my favorite got-to burger joint for when I am having a bad day! I love to get a Mushroom Swiss Burger. I would give it 5 stars for service too","1/17/2019",0
"Whataburger","As a Texan, I have to love Whataburger. I do. I love their food and image and everything. BUT the service I encounter, every single time I go to a location like this, is awful. I don't understand how every other chain of fast food can take up to maybe 8 minutes on a bad day, yet this location takes half an hour at least with 4 people in line. The drive thru is there for convenience to save time, not in this case though. The management needs a complete redo. They need to fix everything about hiring, process etc. Because they are going to lose a lot more customers and cannot keep this crap up solely on their image.","8/20/2017",1
"Whataburger","Whataburger holds a special place in my heart because my favorite aunt, who had a very tragic life and not a lot of money, always took me out to eat there when we visited her in Texas every summer. She would say, Hmm, I feel like a Whataburger. Do you want to go with me? and I'd get so excited. We'd hop into her ancient but well-kept Buick sedan to head on over to our favorite place. Sometimes it was just her and me and other times my mom or brother would join us, but it was always fun. She treated me like a grown-up on these jaunts and I never realized that she did this not just because she knew I enjoyed it, but because she couldn't really afford much more.

I knew I had to visit Whataburger when I was in Dallas for business a few weeks ago for the nostalgia factor. I wanted to give it more than three stars, but unfortunately, it wasn't quite as I remembered.

First of all, the Whataburgers of my childhood had the distinctive A-frame structure that this location was sadly lacking. It was designed just like a plain old McDonald's or Burger King. Then, the interior: burgandy, black, white, and grey...really? Combined with the bright orange and blue exterior trim, this was just hideous. Whataburger, you need to contact Bravo TV and Queer Eye your stores up, stat.

The burger itself was huge. I think I used to eat the Jr. Whataburger, because the Whataburger is as big as my head. It wasn't bad, but not fabulous. Also, the bun was flat. Thank goodness they still have Diet Coke.

I guess the experience would be have been a lot better if Aunt Tere was next to me, giggling over some silly joke of mine or telling me stories about my brothers and sisters when they were kids, but she's been gone a long time now. The restaurants may not look the same, and the burgers may not taste as good as they did to me back then, but the memories I shared with her there will always bring me back to Whataburger when I'm in Texas.","10/21/2007",11

"Whataburger","Only giving them one star because you can't give them zero. I literally called this location because it is that closest location to me and I wanted a burger, however, I know they get busy at night. I didn't want to drive so far out of my way to get there and have to wait over an hour. So, understandably I call this location to ask how long the wait is. They answer the phone, and as soon as I ask how long the wait is, they say something that I cannot understand, I say what? They do not respond. I hang up and call back because no one is responding to me. Upon calling back, she says, I have you number I'm calling 911. I would not recommend this place unless you want to be threatened.","12/2/2018",2

"Whataburger","I'd assume ONE condiment with your order is free.  I already paid the cashier for my food at the first window.  They then asked me if I wanted ketchup.  My food didn't really require ketchup as I didn't get any fries.  A ranch would suffice though.  So I asked for that and they said it would be 38 cents.  Really?","7/25/2015",0
"Whataburger","This is by far the worst Whataburger in the city of Dallas. Our fries were cold, our burgers felt as if they tried to re-heat it, and the apple pies were just awful.   Never go to this location unless you enjoy waiting in line for horribly prepared food.","11/25/2016",2
"Whataburger","Everyone who's complaining about this place, y'all need to chill. Obviously you've never made a mistake in your life *eye roll* I'm from California and nobody can ever take the place of in and out but I like this place. The people here are super nice and efficient, they bring your condiments to your table on a tray for goodness sake. The person who complained about their medium drink being too big? Stop it . This location is kinda out of my way but I'll probably be back when I go exploring again.","2/13/2019",1
"Whataburger","I had to call the manager from my car in the drive-through to get somebody to start taking our orders. Some how at 4:50pm, they didn't realize there were drive-through customers wanting to order. Granted it's fast food, the order taker should be on their game or at least be competent, not the case today. I can't give them a lower score, because it was my choice to come here, despite previous bad experiences. Last time the drive-through literally took 25 minutes, that was the first car in the second lane. They acKnowledged the problem by giving me a free cookie. Today it's been about 20 minutes, plenty  enough time to write this review, and I'm still not up to the window.","3/1/2017",1

"Whataburger","Worst service I've ever had at a Whataburger; ordered three simple items. From the time I pulled up to the make the order from the time I got my food was over 20 minutes. They overcharged me for the two shakes I got (charged me for a large when I got a small) and the chicken sandwich was so overfried, it was inedible. The bag the sandwich was in was splattered with shake residue and the shakes were a complete mess on the outside of the cup. I couldn't believe I waited 20+ minutes and wasted $12. I won't ever return to this location.","4/19/2019",0
"Whataburger","This whataburger has the worst customer service! I mean I understand it's minimum wage and fast food but come on  they're extremely rude over the speaker, they take their time for an order that is less than 5 minutes at any other location! There are like 2 employees there who always seem to have a smile no matter what!

"Whataburger","The food tastes like Whataburger. Really, it does. Whataburger is pretty damned good, too. It is not as good as burger street, but its my second favorite cheap fast food burger spot. This ones has a strange taste to their tea, though. I know that you may think it is silly, but hear me out. I make tea at the house sometimes and it tastes great when you first make it. If you don't drink it for a while then it starts to turn. I don't know what it starts to turn into, but it doesn't taste good. If you wait really long, then it starts to get thicker. Anyways, the tea here tastes like tea tastes before it turns into sludge. I think that maybe the tea canisters are not washed thoroughly and that is why the tea has this taste, but that is just speculation. 

I came back after avoiding it for a bit and ordered the tea again to see if it was just a fluke. The tea had the same nasty taste and the guy at the window saw my face turn like I was gurning. He asked me if I was ok and I told him that the tea tasted quite foul. He gave me a coke instead and said that girl making the tea doesn't know what the hell she is doing! and we both smiled. 

I don't know if ill be back. The food is good, but I think I will just drive a mile north and go somewhere else.","3/20/2015",0

I want to be understanding that it is crowded but everyone else who came with me got their orders long before I never got mine. One things for certain I am NEVER coming back here for sure. Terrible service.","7/9/2017",0
"Whataburger","Had my first whataburger here. Clean location, no complaints about service and getting the burger exactly how I want. I don't like mustard or mayo on anything. without exception. Some people tell me that makes for a boring sandwich or burger. Well that's better than throwing up due to a disgusting mouth full of mayo. :P

The burgers are bigger than I'm used to, bun is the size of a pancake. And the burger is kind of flattened down like a pancake. Big beefy patty and not overly greasy. Fries are crisp and the ketchup is great. I don't know if it's a special recipe but it's better than any other fast food ketchup.

As far as fast food burger chains, I'd give In-N-Out the nod over Whataburger. Both are better than Five Guys and below Fat Burger.","3/31/2012",0
"Whataburger","Me and my boyfriend went up there for a late night snack around 12:20 am it took more than 5 minutes for someone to get our order in the drive thru not only that but the guy was really rude and they didn't have soda?

"Whataburger","Anytime I visit a fast food place my expectations are proportional to just that...fast food. 

Pros: Their breakfast is decent and their dining room is spacious.

Cons: I usually order a basic burger with bacon but the quality is not the same. I've lived near the area for a few years and have noticed a reduction. A few months back I ordered a plain burger and the meat actually tasted rancid. I have not been back since. The drive through line, especially at night, is ridiculous. I'm not sure how other other locations are but this one is not worth visiting.

"Whataburger","This is going to be a short review. I've only been to Whataburger twice (so sue me lol). This past Sunday morning I needed to pick up some sausage biscuits for the hard-working kiddos who help us set up the church on Sunday mornings. I'm on Atkins, so I couldn't eat a biscuit, but they smelled and looked amazing! Good size for the price. 

For myself I'd ordered bacon and eggs. I gotta say, those eggs were amaze-o! Juicy and they tasted real (sorry MckeyD's!). The bacon was good too, not too crispy, just right. Also, I ordered two waters and they gave me two medium cups of water complete with ice, a lid, and a straw, none of that flimsy plastic cup stuff. :-p","3/25/2014",0
"Whataburger","Went to Arlington,Texas for a football game. A few coworkers kept telling me to try Whataburger while I was in Texas. The burger was good.

"Whataburger","Employee completely ignored everything I said when ordering.   The dining room is filthy!   Most tables are covered with garbage and can't be used by customers.  The cashiers are not providing tent numbers.   Instead, employees are yelling customer numbers.   Massive confusion.  Many employees are on duty at 12 midnight.  Not one is taking care of the dining area!!!   Never again!","10/27/2018",0
"Whataburger","Service has VASTLY improved over the past few months. Before this location was soooooo slow. Once I was caught in line for 45min. It was insane. But now they are incredibly fast and friendly. I am always greeted by a very kind manager. The staff at the driver through line this last Monday night was very kind and efficient as well. I will go here more often now that service is better. I am better they got new management.","7/25/2018",0
"Whataburger","This is a solid Whataburger. They take clean very seriously. I've never had any issue with the staff getting my order wrong, forgetting anything, being rude, or any other issue one might expect from fast food restaurants. 

The locations is perfect for us since it's on my way to work (dangerous!) and close to our house. Nice to have something that I can trust to get it right and safe on the first time, and with a smile! 

For breakfast, I recommend the potato and cheese taquito with the spicy ketchup. The fiancé goes for the chicken butter biscuit. He says he just wishes the chicken was a little bit bigger. Also, I'd love to have a larger serving of the side of hash browns!","9/21/2013",1
"Whataburger","If I could give this place ZERO STARS I would. This place is a joke. I waited 40 minutes for food. This is a catastrophe do not come.","11/18/2018",0
"Whataburger","My girlfriend and I love Whataburger, but this location is not an accurate representation of the chain. We visited on a Saturday night which was our first mistake. We ordered our food (a #1 with cheese and a #2 with cheese) and after about 25 minutes received our order which was incorrect (no cheese in site). I returned the food in hopeful exchange for the right order. Waited 5 more minutes and ended up with three burgers somehow which were all wrong once again. We decided to just eat our food at this point because we were tired and hungry. While eating, we were thoroughly entertained watching a handful of workers standing around while customers were getting irritated and leaving without food. To their credit, a few workers tried their hardest to intervene and resolve the issues in spite of being super overwhelmed. We were just grateful we ended up with something because 6 of the people who ordered before us waited 45+ minutes for their food. Two wrong orders: $15.46, amazing people watching: priceless.","10/21/2018",0
"Whataburger","the only reason I come to this whataburger is because it's the closest to where I live. I've sat in the drive thru line for 30 minutes TWICE now. this time, i got my food & my fries were lukewarm. I asked for a side of gravy for my fries & didn't get that (even though I paid extra for it). I was going to go inside to get it & leave, but the dining room doors were locked as they now close the dining room after 10(?). the manager motioned to me that they were closed & that I should go through the drive thru. I showed him the receipt in my hand & he just turned away. I'm sorry, but that is no way to treat a paying customer. I sincerely hope that they get a better set of employees soon that actually know what the heck they're doing. evidently that's not the case right now.","5/30/2016",0
"Whataburger","Apparently this is something pretty popular in Texas. Burger quality is not as great as say... In N Out, but it has some pretty good burgers on the cheap! I like how they use big pieces of chicken inside the burgers. Not that bad if you ask me!","12/16/2015",0
"Whataburger","Decent fast food. The service however was exceptional at this place. Staff was friendly and helpful as I was a first timer. I had the chicken tenders which reminded me or Raising Canes if you're from the north. Fresh served with fries and a slice of bread. The spicy ketchup was delicious! Would return if ever in the area.","3/12/2015",2
"Whataburger","went to this place for the first time I really cant understand why people like this place the burger is nasty  dry no flavor fries was no good I will stick to in n out 10 times better if you are texas don't waste your time or money on this place never going back.","12/5/2017",0

I keep meaning to try the chicken strip sandwich, but the burgers are so good, I haven't ever convinced myself to do it. Service can be a little slow- but that's because they're making all the food fresh.","1/1/2017",0

"Whataburger","What can I say - those who live in the south know what I'm talking about!  This place has the bomb burgers  just a plain ole good hamburger.  Love their spicy ketchup!!  Can't get this in the Midwest.  Whataburger, please come north.","10/19/2015",0
"Whataburger","Whataburger has to be horrible for you.  But it is sooooo good.  I love their specialty burgers, especially the Montery Melt and A1 Thick and Hearty.  They have tons of sauces to dip fries and those are great too.  Honey Mustard and Jalepaneo Ranch are my favs.  There are a few times I have had stomach aches after eating there.  I assume because the food isn't great for you.","11/9/2015",0
"Whataburger","Maybe I hyped it up a bit, but it wasn't like what I remembered it when I ate it for the first time near San Antonio area (read my other Whataburger review). It tasted kind of ordinary, like Lot-A-Burger in Oxnard. It's still decently good. The service is always (Southern Hospitality) good!","4/28/2008",2

"Whataburger","My worst whataburger experience ever. It was chaos when I came in around 730pm on a Monday. The drive-in line was to the street so I decided to park and go inside not seeing any lines. The lady at the front was nice but I could easily tell there was tension in the restaurant. There were people scattered everywhere throughout the diner waiting on their food. There was staff who looked like they were taking a break just sitting at random tables. There wasn't a manager on duty. It took 30 minutes for me to get my food. Very frustrating experience as I know this location shut down for a month over the past couple of years with similar issues. Avoid this whataburger around dinner.","1/31/2018",0
"Whataburger","I lived in Texas as a kid and remember fondly my parents picking up Whataburger breakfast taquitos on weekends and always being excited by them.

I haven't had Whataburger since then, a good 20 years ago. Fast forward to a few weeks ago and I finally got to try them again. They were not so good. Maybe it was my underd-eveloped children tastebuds tricking me.

I tried the burger that everyone swears by. It was decent, but nothing amazing. Definitely doesn't hold a candle to Carl's Jr or In N Out.

I will admit that the chicken sandwich was pretty bomb though.","6/26/2011",1
"Whataburger","Used to be something special, not anymore.  Don't get me wrong, the employees are still friendly,  The main attraction, The Whataburger, is lame.  More gristle than I new a single how could contain.  Disappointing.  Not  a legendary burger,  like Blake's Lota Burger or California's, second to none,, In and Out burger.

Wont be back.","5/3/2014",0
"Whataburger","Guess what? It's fast food. Just a decent greasy burger at a fast food price. 
I have not been to Whataburger in over a year. I saw someone walk in with a bag, here at work, and I got the itch for a hot greasy burger and fries I can dunk into some ketchup. I love the ketchup. 
After finishing my brunch (since I missed breakfast), I could feel nothing but disgusting. HA - mission accomplished.","7/13/2009",0
"Whataburger","Whataburger food always taste good, but this place's service is appalling is makes it impossible to deal with. They show nearly zero respect for the customer, can't speak properly and believe the word free no matter how loud you yell it, they respond back,  i gotchu, three whataburger.  Absolute stingiest when it comes to giving you sauce and will look at you like you are crazy when you ask for more than 2 packets of ketchup for 4 meals. NEVER go to this establishment, it is worth taking the extra time to go to the one on North Greenville Ave.","4/30/2015",0
"Whataburger","First off, love the staff. Any place that let's you order through drive thru when you are drunk and don't have a DD is awesome :)

"Whataburger","I am a hardcore whataburger fan. I came into whataburger today and was almost forgotten about. My order took a while to be received. By the time my food got to me my fries were cold... luckily Troinecia was there to make sure and ask me if my fries were still hot and my burger was prepared well. I really appreciate her great customer service and turning my bad experience into a great one. I love whataburger","7/9/2015",0
"Whataburger","This is definitely the worst whataburger their is in Dallas. Sucks for me since it's the closest and stays up all night which I do appreciate. How ever the staff is very rude and all seem like they're not trying to be their. While at the drive thru I was asked to wait a few more seconds, cool a few minutes had past than a few more minutes had past and I asked if she was ready and she said 1 more sec their was 2 cars ahead of me at 5am what could possibly be taking nearly 10min to get my order. Im already prepared for it to take 15min since I come every night and seems to be a problem here. I'm a server at pluckers and I'm sure everyone knows how busy we are. I get my guest food out in minutes. Their is no excuse for poor service. That's why canes, and Chick-fil-A have a good reviews and stay steady. I would rather pay more for my employees to give good service and have clients keep coming back than have a dry or upset ones that write reviews like this and probably will share my experience with others.","7/8/2017",0
"Whataburger","Andrea was professional, friendly & efficient working the counter.  My Green Chile cheeseburger Jr was greasy and wonderfully delicious.  The order of onion rings, hot crisp with really good flavor.  Been told about Whataburger by the natives for years, well today I became a convert","10/29/2014",0
"Whataburger","I will probably not go to this whataburger again. Unless I'm in dire need. They took my order and my card and when I got to the second window, they asked for my order 3 more times because it was never sent to the kitchen. Then after at least one failed burger and 10 minutes later, I got my burger. Half a second later I realized I had no fries. I had to knock on the window to get their attention, but I finally got my fries. Except they were half full as well as the shake I ordered. I love whataburger but the owner of this one needs to fix some of the problems and teach their workers how to properly complete an order.","1/20/2016",1

"Whataburger","Ordered fries, drink, plain cheeseburger & 3 chicken fingers. Took 20 minutes to get food after ordering inside. I was okay with that. Whataburger is usually delicious ..BUT when I opened my food bag at home the burger had all the toppings & I opened the chicken finger box to find a dipping sauce, the standard Texas toast and nothing else! They more or less messed up three things tonight! This is my second Yelp review in the several years I've used Yelp so yeah. Get a new Mgr or something because it will be quite a while before I go back to that location.","3/31/2016",0
"Whataburger","We went here right after In n Out so we could compare and we definitely liked it. The menu here has way more choice and is also more inspired as far as innovation and flavor combinations. I got the patty melt which was great and kim got the green chili burger which was also good. The only thing that was not as great was quality I guess but for what it is, its definitely a place we liked. We'll be back next year on our annual trip to Dallas.","12/1/2013",0
"Whataburger","This place use to NEVER get my order right and two times they completely forgot I was waiting for my food and I was inside!? I had to ask what was taking so long and they asked me to reorder.  But recently the customer service has drastically improved and the food comes out fresh and fast. Everyone seems happy and to be at work.","3/21/2014",0

"Whataburger","It's been a while since I last ate at this Whataburger. I was mega-pregnant and was starving. I was shocked at the freshness of my Bacon Cheeseburger and VERY fresh out of the fryer fries. We have since moved to Washington State and Whataburger is something that makes me want to fly to Texas! The Haskell Avenue area isn't the best place to be in the Dallas area, but this one was very clean and employees where polite and understood my need to devour food quickly. :)","7/24/2011",0
"Whataburger","Stay away from this place at night early morning. Bunch of idiots work here. 10 kids goofing around and one old Mexican lady doing all the work. I ordered 2 breakfast sandwiches and I got two biscuits with bacon. Wtf. Called the store and told them they are idiots. Called the hotline and told them to check the cameras. Cops sitting outside in the parking lot should have been my sign this place was no good!","4/4/2015",0
"Whataburger","I hardly ever go to Whataburger anymore, usually because there's not one convenient to me. I had to go to uptown this morning and this location was nearby. I made the mistake of stopping there on my way home. I guess they had a new drive thru worker that was hard of hearing. Or maybe I was not speaking loud enough since it was so early in the morning. I thought I had clearly stated my order but she repeated it more than once and had it wrong. She must've said No cheese? three times. I was told to go to the second window. I got just past the first window and a girl stuck her head out. I don't know if she was the one to take the order. She said very rudely what my total was and I said I was told to go to the second window. I guess she had been busy at the time which was why I was told that. So I got to the second window and once again my order was repeated incorrectly. I barely said anything because I just WANTED TO GO HOME. She handed me my food, said something that I didn't understand, then said have a nice day. I was tempted to call and demand to know what she said, but I was not willing to waste energy on a fast food restaurant at 7:30am on a Saturday. Yes I know I already have by writing this. I just wanted a stupid taquito without a side of attitude from an employee. I don't know why this surprises me anymore. Thanks Whataburger for ruining my morning.","11/15/2014",0

"Whataburger","i visited the whataburger drive through at 3160 se loop 820, fort worth, 76140.  while sitting in the drive through with only one customer in front and nobody behind us, the customer in front received his drink. had possesion of the drink for about 2-3 minutes. he returned to drive through employee (with straw inserted) and she placed in corner of drive through glass in plain sight. gave customer in front a new soda. we had 2 sodas with our order ( important). we pull forward and the soda still sat in the window. employee tries to hand me the used soda (who knows what happened in other customers posession) and says other soda will be right out.  our 2 sodas are already made and sitting together on fountain. i said are u serious? i said i saw the customer return it. she said i am sorry and became overly (sarcasticly) friendly. we reported to whataburger. the next night about 10:30pm, a person called and left a voice mail message saying they were the regional manager, and was not sure what we expected them to do!   what? someone should review tape, and someone should get fired!!!   

 beware, beware, beware!

with all the diseases out, terrorist acts, i have no intention of drinking someone elses returned soda to save 20 cents

our sodas were already made!  wtf!

if u tell us u dont know what we expect u to do, ill post on yelp and inform the public.","10/24/2013",0
"Whataburger","I ordered ahead on the app and picked up my dinner inside at 6pm on a Monday. This was the cleanest Whataburger I have been in, I was impressed. My order was ready quickly, hot, tasty, and accurate to the changes I made. Keep up the great work guys!","8/1/2022",0
"Whataburger","I wasn't real pleased with the food quality of my 3 orders #5's. While I was waiting for my togo order I realize three orders of ff's were made, and sat for at least 7 minutes. Pity the soul who has to eat those I thought, lol. Well, I'm that sole of a shoe, lol. My ff's were not only cold, but undercooked the burgers were room temperature.
It also took a really long time to complete my order.","1/4/2023",3
"Whataburger","I have grown up around this Whataburger and this was a favorite destination to go to right after high school track meets. The service was always great, employees nice and respectful. Fast forward to the present day, I have notice that the service and quality has gone down significantly. On 11/28/2022, my friends and I received our orders after 15-45 minutes waiting and they were not warm at all. Worst of all, the people who ordered after us got their orders before we did. On 12/26/2022, I ordered a meal and they forgot my drink order and did not offer any condiments. The food was not warm upon getting my order through the drive through. When I went in to get my drink, the staff just handed me a cup and said nothing. I would not recommend going to this particular Whataburger unless you are looking for poor management and subpar service.","12/30/2022",0
"Whataburger","The menu has changed for the worse. Even the staff thinks the upcharges and menu have changed for the worse. Who charges additional costs for MUSTARD?! They even charge for ketchup if it's not designated for the sandwich/meal. No more mushroom Swiss burger because a multi million dollar franchise refuses to pay for quality products... honestly I'd rather have McDonalds than this, and McDonald's is trash... so deductive reasoning.","6/11/2022",1
"Whataburger","I hope I've finally learned my lesson...

I ordered via the app at 11:02 pm on Sunday 3/7/22. Said my order would be ready at 11:12 pm. I get to the restaurant and the dining area is locked and apparently closed for the night as of 11 pm. I called the store and the person said I have to go thru the drive thru. I tell her there are 8 ppl in the drive thru waiting to order. I've already ordered. She said once I get to the speaker they'll rush me to the window. I say, 'Okay' and pull in line with the others in a double drive thru but with only one lane open. 

The point of ordering via the app in advance is to avoid the wait at the store and yet there I was at 11:28 pm waiting in line to get to the speaker so they can advance me to get my food order. 

I figured this was probably a safety issue as the curbside parking spots are at the front area of the dimly lit parking lot. I imagine that they didn't want to put their employees at risk by exiting the restaurant late at night and walking to a stranger's vehicle.

However, when I finally got to the speaker, I was instructed to pull forward in the second, outer lane of the drive thru.  About 5 mins later, someone walked my food out to my car. Not quite as far of a walk but still could pose a risk.

Anyway, they should at least give notification on the app that the dining is closed. I would more than likely not have made an order if I knew this was the case.

This is a ridiculous set up and service. I just felt like this is truly poor management and delivery of services!","3/8/2022",1
"Whataburger","After almost finishing all of my Whatachicken sandwich from this location I found a dead bug on the bun. Had my hungry self waited till I got home instead of eating it in the car, I'm sure I would have noticed it sooner. I am so disgusted, no thank you I don't like bugs as extra protein! The service the drive through provided was great but once I seen one of those worm looking bugs with multiple legs, I'm good.

"Whataburger","This particular location is horrible with service day or night, wait time via ALL app/no app/drive-thru/walk-in. Because this locations convenience to my house, I've been able to give this particular store front more than fair opportunity to change my mind of refusing this location. My mind is made and my dollars will go to the Retail Rd. Whatabuger over this Whataburger. The individuals who are on the speaker box do not understand that TONE IS EVERYTHING. The kids working the front need to understand that the customers see you and your work friends & whatever jokes you all have between each other doesn't translate well to patrons because we're hungry and now confused if our food is the joke. Customer service is apparently not a skill that is required even if the manager is 3 feet away. Ordering from the app you'll still have a wait of 15-20 MINIMUM! I've waited up to 40min before, then it ended up being wrong. Even if you're staring at an employee trying to hide from the eyesight of the register playing with their phone just outside the bathrooms... We see you buddy... They need a corporate deep dive, then from the top of the leaderboard down to the bottom replace/release the non producers.","10/19/2022",0

She said that this is Mexican territory and Texas was stolen from Mexico!! 
I am a veteran who defended our flag and I take great pride in it!

"Whataburger","I wish I could give this location a negative 100. The night manager Chris is completely and utterly disrespectful and unprofessional. I ordered two sandwiches. One with cheese and one without. They gave me two sandwiches with cheese on them both. I sent one back only to get it back with the cheese scrapped off. I showed It to another manager Sam who asked Chris to get it remade. Chris decided to come outside and scold me about this being my second sandwich I sent back and that they did not do what I'm saying they did . He was extremely belittling as if I was stupid. I asked for a refund and he locked the door on me as if I didn't say I wanted a refund. I am waiting ti hear back from corporate but NO ONE should ever have to be disrespected in front of their children over a sandwich that was not properly made. Sam and two other employees along with a customer saw where the cheese has just been scraped off. Chris had one job; apologize and remake the sandwich not belittle me about a mistake made under his watch.","7/28/2022",0
"Whataburger","Very slow service and cold food. Takes a good while (we waited 30+ minutes even after ordering) to make it through the drive through lane. frequently orders are wrong.  Food today was room temp which is concerning for food safety. If you want the quintessential texas whataburger experience this is not the place to get it. Shocking how different of a drive through experience it is from the Chick-fil-A around the block. This place could be making bank but has a long way to go to catch up to an acceptable speed of service.","5/30/2022",0

Even when you are at sit down estaurant it doesnt take almost 40 minutes to get your food, no matter how many people are in the restaurant!

I know that the food is fresh made here, but there is no reason why food should take this long! It is obvious that something needs to change-- and to have to wait all that time for a $10 combo meal?!? I know you can do better Whataburger.","10/6/2019",1

"Whataburger","When that urge to grab a quality fast food bite overcomes your desire to reduce your waist line, this is the Whataburger location to go to.  And actually, their salad selections have been my go to of late as I trim down for an upcoming Half Marathon.  

Whatabuger has stringent quality standards and this location is very good at following them.  My last couple of visits have been for chicken and salads and all were well prepared and great tasting.  

If you want a smaller size burger, the regular (not Whatasized) are the route to go.  If you are really famished, you can add more large meat patties to the already large Whata sized burgers.

I do think their fries and pies are some of the best out there.  I am fond of the lemon pie.

The staff were not the friendliest on my last 2 visits and that keeps them from the 5th star.  Perhaps it was the dinner rushes taking place.  

The place has been here for more than 20 years and is usually well maintained in the parking area and the building. It appears someone went crashing through the border fence a few weeks ago and that still needs some repair work done.","10/2/2017",5
"Whataburger","Can't seem to take more than an order an hour and when you get your food it's wrong. If you go through the drive through expect to spend about an hour if there's more than 1 car ahead of you. Dining room closes at 10 pm. There's another Whataburger on Skillman that is much faster so go there instead.","1/30/2022",0
"Whataburger","Wish I could give a zero star. If you are ordering online for take out, they won't let you into the restaurant at night. The staff just sat there and watched us waving at them. They also get your order wrong if you don't do it online. Go to somewhere else or change a restaurant. They need to hire some staff that are willing to work.","1/22/2022",0
"Whataburger","Uncle Mitty has been gettin' a Whataburger fix pert near ever week since he's been jest a little tadpole. If Uncle Mitty has enough foldin' money after recyclin' his empties and stockin' the trailer icebox with PBR, he heads down to Whataburger to lay a lip on a jalepener and cheese Whataburger. 

Jest last week, Uncle Mitty was a runnin' some errands in the Chevy Vega and decided to take a whirl in the drive-thru lane at the Greenville location. After placin' his order, Uncle Mitty tuned into some Conway Twitty on the radio and put his dogs up on the dash since the wait was a tad long in that there drive-through line. Uncle  Mitty weren't sure if the feller in front of him in line had placed an order fer his entire workplace or he had ordered somethin' exotic like a mushroom swiss burger.

After a tolerable wait, Uncle Mitty finally got his jalepener and cheese burger and was on his way.  Damn burger was tasty even if Uncle Mitty had to wait a spell.

And Uncle Mitty's no good roommate, Lester, didn't mind the wait since the Chevy Vega weren't a runnin' at that particular moment and Uncle Mitty was usin' some Lester manual push-power to get through that damn line.","3/6/2020",4

"Whataburger","Been going to this location on and off for the last 10 years. I always end up giving them another chance after all of their bad customer service and their incorrect orders. I decided to walk in tonight and give them another chance.  I asked the cashier how she was doing... her response was I asked you what I could get you not how you're doing. I literally turned around and walked out. Called the manager to let him know what happened and he was about the same as the lackluster cashier. This is by far the worst whataburger around. I've never been to one that's even close to how bad this place is.  I mean it's seems like they try to piss their customers off.","8/1/2021",1
"Whataburger","This location has long lines that do not move an inch for  30 minutes. No idea on if they're having delivery drivers pick up a lot at once from the drive through window and clogging it up, or just terribly managed. Either way this is hands down the worst one in Dallas, even before they mess up your order.","10/20/2021",0
"Whataburger","Slowest drive through ever. I don't understand how it can be that slow and the food look so tired.  Avoid if you can. Whataburger at Skillman and Northwest Hwy infinitely better. Even if it's out of your way, you will net out spending the same amount of time by avoiding an unexplainable wait at the Greenville location.","3/28/2021",0
"Whataburger","Always good!! Perfect late night food after Ubering for a few hours. This particular location is exceptional!! Management is so sweet and checks on tables constantly.

I finally got my two garden salads and drove off...saw I didn't have croutons in the bag and made a u-turn... the person inside said they don't have croutons anymore... at least change the price then or when it changes make sure to disclose that at the time of ordering... probably would've gone with some thing else if I knew I was just paying $9 for lettuce. Save your time and just go to the neighboring In & Out!","5/16/2021",0

"Whataburger","So I really don't have anything negative about the food from whataburger. But I must say that this location has the worst sanitation out of any whataburger I've been in. Right before ordering my food I used the men's room. As soon as I walked in something just wasn't right. I look at the toilet and there was poop all over the wall and the toilet seat. After telling the employee she said well I'm not going in there. Instead of cleaning it they put an out of order sign on it. Good food horrible facilities.","1/15/2017",0
"Whataburger","Greenville Ave. has everything including all the old favorite fast food joints, Whataburger being one of them. I was told by pretty much anyone in the know that Whataburger is better than In-N-Out (how dare they) so I knew that this was the time I had to see what all the hype was about. 

OK, so it's not a bad burger, in fact it's a pretty damn good one. 

I ordered the standard #1 - Whataburger with cheese, which comes with fries and a drink. I think the the onions are what makes a Whataburger burger special. I couldn't eat the thing fast enough, it was that good! 

But you know, I'm a purist and I still think In-N-Out's the winner. Whataburger's fries are better than In-N-Out's though so I'll give them that. Come on...after like 4 or 5 minutes In-N-Out's fries get soft unless you order them well which I normally do. My only gripe with Whataburger is that their burger patties are thin. For a state that's known for its meat, I was surprised that I received so little of it on my burger. 

Skinny meat or not I intend to come back whenever I'm in TX. Sure there's In-N-Out in Dallas too, but why spoil perfection outside of CA? :)","4/21/2016",5

"Whataburger","Will never go back!

"Whataburger","I ordered a shake from here last night , but they told me the machine was down. So I got a fountain drink instead. After I left, as I walked home, the entire bottom of the cup just fell out and the drink spilled all over me. I came back the next day to order, and I mentioned this to the cashier. She instantly gave me an attitude and insisted I was lying. What do you want me to do about it? She said. I could see she was baiting me for an argument but I didn't give it to her so I just paid for my food. I come here all the time and I've never had this happen. I'm pissed that she would respond to me that way. I wasn't trying to get anything free-- just telling them about their faulty cups-- and this is the treatment I get?","10/24/2019",0

"Whataburger","Exceptional new staff and service!
I have been coming to this Whataburger for many years. The new staff and manager have really improved the service and atmosphere. Alex is very friendly, keeps up a constant banter with customers, staff, people coming and going. A real comedian! The store is clean, and the service rapid. I always come inside to order and rarely have to wait in line. I like their food, and the way they continually vary the menu. My favorites are the Monterey Melt an the chorizo taquitos. The regular breakfast taquito with eggs, bacon and cheese is very good, especially if you add the sautéed fajita veggies!","2/15/2019",0
"Whataburger","I asked for a hamburger at the drive through. They asked me if I wanted cheese - I said no. They couldn't hear me, so I drove to the window to give my order. I got a bun with meat only. I asked where the rest was and they told me that I'd asked for a plain burger. Then they gave me one without lettuce and mustard. I asked them what had happened and they told me I should have asked for them. I gave up and drove away. Never going to this location again.","12/19/2019",0
"Whataburger","As much time as I've spent in Texas the last decade we've eaten plenty of Whataburger - always in the middle of the night as with this visit was at 10 p.m. Meanwhile, this stop (and a few others at this location) came in the early evening as my nephews live down the street and they prefer Whataburger over the other fast food chains nearby. The drive-through did a great job at moving the line quickly and got our order correct. 

On the other hand, this is your typical fast food chain with below average quality food, yet affordable prices. Personally, I think Whataburger is much better than McDonalds, Burger King, Crystal, Rally's, Steak N Shake, Wendy's, etc. In fact, there's no comparison. Meanwhile, I do my best to avoid these fast food chains except late at night when most other places are closed. We rolled through the drive through and got exactly what we expected with no complaints.

If you are looking for a late night burger this is one of your better options. It took fewer than five minutes to get our food. It came the way we ordered it and tasted like all Whataburger meals taste - like a fast food burger. Ironically, they were out of ketchup.

When you scan the menu, here's a few do's and don'ts:

*Order a Whataburger

*Avoid the chicken tenders. They are terrible compared to Zaxby's & Bojangles. And, I mean terrible.

*Expect to eat the fries. They are similar to McDonalds. And, loaded with salt, which makes them taste even better.

*Order a burger on Texas Toast. It's better than the regular bun.","1/2/2017",0

They only do that at Sonic I thought .

Other than that we always enjoy the food, it's the wait time ...","1/15/2019",0
"Whataburger","Full disclaimer, I don't eat burgers. But with that said, I did come here for breakfast twice and tried some of their other options. Whataburger is a fastfood restaurant, so how much can we really expect from the place? It's super quick and friendly staff. Kept pretty clean for the most part. 

If you dine in, they deliver the food to you with a tray of condiments. I loved the spicy ketchup. I've never heard of that before coming here and I'm glad I've had the chance to experience its greatness.

So lets talk food. The chicken biscuit was scrumptious! The honey sauce thing was oozing out of the biscuit. The chicken was perfectly fried and not dry. The jalapeno sausage biscuit was equally as good. A little kick to get things going in the morning, although, I believe they serve breakfast all day. 

Overall, wasn't a terrible experience, just not top quality gourmet. I would def. go back one day.","4/15/2016",1
"Whataburger","Late night grub. Nom Nom Nom. I like that I can get a mix of breakfast and dinner foods. The jalapeno cheddar biscuit was delicious with chicken. I don't like the long line or the confusing two-line drive thru system that is used.

Only go here if you have 20-30 minutes to wait to just receive the food.

When I finally got to the window- she tried to give me another customer's  order. When I politely tried to tell her that it wasn't my order- unbelievably-this woman actually argued with me insisting it was! When I told her what my actual order was she interrupted me with Calm down! I was perfectly 'calm' before but now I was irritated at this rude attitude. At this point I asked to speak with the manager. A few minutes later another girl appeared with an attitude ten times worse. I asked her to please read back my order in case there was another mistake. She completely lost her temper and shoved a bag at me saying quote, You done piss me off!  Then she handed me a milkshake with the styrofoam cup SEVERED IN HALF the contents of which ended up in my lap. I then asked for the manager again while this vindictive ugly half-wit slammed the window and ignored my request speak to the manager.

Won't be going to this whataburger at all again, and will try and avoid the entire chain going forward.

"Whataburger","Horrible service today well not just today the last several times we been. They always take a long time to make your order which is good cause it's fresh but in this case we waited 15 min for drinks. They pre make your drink when you order so they sit there until you pay. They took 15 min to charge me when they try to had me my sure to be flat sprit I asked for a new one they did not appreciate that. No service with a smile for me. 

Another story we eat in the dinner one day when we noticed a homeless man digging in the trash grabbed a cup refill it and took off the staff act like it happens all the time. I went for a refill and demand they give it from the drive thru fountain. I might be making a bigger deal than it was but homeboy pulled a cup from the trash and touched the fountain. Staff did not care they only cleaned when the management noticed I was not pleased.","1/18/2015",0

"Whataburger","Let me save you some trouble. If you're deciding whether you want Whataburger or literally anything else, pick anything else. The workers are far from professional. There were 5+ workers there and 2-3 of them were just standing around talking to the people that were actually working. I was ordering for my Dad and I and my dad told the cashier that he wanted everything I ordered and the cashier asked him to make sure and they still got my order wrong. They didn't duplicate my order so my dad had to go buy what they didn't put on my order. I will say that my burger was good but my fries were far too salty. It's like they dumped a whole bag of salt on my fries. The chocolate shake I got wasn't totally mixed so it looked like I got a half vanilla-half chocolate shake. I will by no means go there again. I hope you heed my warning before spending your money there.","10/23/2017",0

I also waited 25 mins for a shake or prolly more because I did set a timer on my phone because we waited over five minutes.! So yea never going there or any other WhatAburger places ever!.","4/23/2017",0
"Whataburger","It is hard to get in and out of the parking lot, especially at meal times.  The food is tasty, though.  I especially like the chicken strips because they aren't too spicy, just delicious.","8/12/2018",0
"Whataburger","The mere thought of my taking a trip to Whataburger country makes my mouth drool....  We just don't have Whataburger here in Tennessee.  I recently visited Dallas on a business trip, and as soon as I got checked into my hotel, I found out where the nearest Whataburger was (the one I'm reviewing) and headed straight there.

It was within walking distance of my hotel, but I didn't know that leaving the hotel, so I drove and then parked a very short distance later in the parking lot.  I headed inside, and I could already smell the Whataburger tasty goodness.

I ordered a Whataburger with fries and a coke.  The cashier/server was attentive, if not friendly.  She got my order right and brought it right out to me as soon as it was ready.  It was every bit as good as I remembered.  The hamburger was cooked just right and there was the right amount of toppings on it.  I really enjoyed that Whataburger and I will look forward to the next time I'm in a Whataburger town for another.

As for this location, it was clean, the employees were attentive,  the food was  great.  I would definitely return here for another meal!","12/7/2009",3
"Whataburger","Rude, rude, rude. We walked in at 10:55 and were ignored until 11:02. They stop serving breakfast at 11:00 and refused to let us order breakfast when we were finally acknowledged at 11:02. They made breakfast food for the people in the drive thru, but wouldn't make it for us.","11/26/2015",0
"Whataburger","I try not to eat fast food.  But that stupid A-1 Thick and Hearty Burger is only going to be available for a limited time only.  Ever.  Never had it,  never craved it, but stupid commercial told me I won't be able to have it ever again after a limited time so I must.  

Touche Whataburger marketing team, you got me.","12/14/2009",0
"Whataburger","Horrible service. I went in this morning and asked for triple meat whataburger and a1 thick in hardy. The employee at the counter made me feel awkward and weird just because I said I didn't want bacon on my a1 thick and hardy. I get that I could order a double meat whataburger with a1 sauce and make the order that I want - but I said I want a1 thick and hardy with no bacon which should not be that hard to do. They took 10+ minutes to make my burgers even tho it was not busy at all - I was the only one who was waiting on my on my order.","4/24/2015",1
"Whataburger","This is THE WORST whataburger I've ever been to. Every single time I go there, they always get my order wrong. One would think oh maybe there's a bunch of people that don't speak good English that don't understand the orders but no, they all speak English perfectly well. They just somehow manage to mess my order up every single time I go. Any normal drive thru experience should take 10 min at the absolute most. Whataburger usually takes 20 min at the least. I'm EXTREMELY dissatisfied with the quality of the food and service.","4/27/2016",0
"Whataburger","I miss this place.  Good college memories of riding up to the 24 hr location in the wee hours of the morning.  Order the breakfast platter number three with OJ - yum!

"Whataburger","Was in Dallas taking care of some errands and decided to stop here for breakfast/lunch, it was around 10:15AM. There was a huge line inside as well as in the drive through. Took a while to get up front to order my food. It was delivered quickly and was alright. My only complaint was that the burger was very very greasy, the bun was soaked with grease and grease was still dripping off the burger. I will continue going to the Whataburger near me but won't be going back to this one.","3/22/2015",0
"Whataburger","OLD/COLD French Fries.  Pulled out of the drive through starving as it is 4 PM on a Thursday and I'm finally getting lunch...so I reached in my Whataburger Togo bag for a scrumptious fry and to my disappointment it was completely cold. Like room temperature. I realize I was there at 4 PM but what this means is that these fries have been chillen since about 1 PM when the lunch crowed died down. 3 HRS! Makes me reeeaaallly nervous about my grilled chx sandwich.... Maybe it was an off day. I'll be back and will update...","4/23/2015",0

Go ahead guess....","5/3/2014",0
"Whataburger","I go to this Whataburger quiet frequently, especially in the early am hours.

"Whataburger","Holy! This is by far the worst wataburger in the world. I have been here now 3 times and they have messed up my order 3 times..... not to mention that you will wait an average of about 20 min to get through the drive through.","2/25/2015",0
"Whataburger","Ok.....first off I am not one to usually rate cookie-cutter fast food eateries, but I felt this was worth mentioning.  This last Sunday I was a lil' hung over.  I needed grease and did not want to be around people.  So I loaded up Bella (my dog) and drove slowly over to Whataburger.  Went drive-thru.  Ordered the Patty Melt combo (not recommended on a regular day, but on a hungover day.......oh yeah) with a Dr Pepper.  Got to the window, paid, and waited.  During this wait one of the workers passed the window and got all excited to see Bella.  And then it happend......she gave her a chicken strip!!!!  Now this really made Bella's day.  Its unusual to go somewhere with your dog (other than PetsMart) and they get something.  Very nice gesture of that young lady and one that'll make me go back over and over and over again.","8/12/2008",5
"Whataburger","This Whataburger is, by far, my favorite Whataburger.  It's always really quick to get your food (especially compared to some other Whataburgers I've been to), and, as previously mentioned, they'll patiently wait for the train to pass, since it's always stupid loud.  The dining room is open late, which is awesome for those drunken grease will soak up the alcohol munchies.  They've never gotten any of my orders wrong, which is awesome as I'm such a picky eater.  I'm SO glad I live so close to this one!","12/27/2009",1
"Whataburger","Whataburger is my stress-food. Whenever I'm having a bad day, all I have to do is drive to my local Whataburger restaurant and order a number one whatameal with no pickles and no onions, and I'm set. It just makes everything better. As far as the whataburgers in the world go, this one is pretty quick. They also have the 2 lane system which really cuts down on wait time. I always choose the outer lane because i enjoy not sitting right by the window. The employees are very nice here also, and will patiently wait as the train passes to complete your order. However! Last time I came here I asked for no onions, and I got onions. That's alright, though. ..I'll give them another chance.","11/17/2009",1
"Whataburger","Whackaburger?!   I had the double whack and the patty was as dry as the bread.  One star for the ketchup.  Another star more because they were reliably unreliable to our 5AM craving and because my friend liked his patty melt.","3/16/2010",1
"Whataburger","For some reason, I keep coming back. Probably just because it is super close to me. You have to repeat your order at least 3 times before they get it. My order is almost never right, so I sit and check it in the line before driving off.","2/22/2015",1
"Whataburger","This whataburger has the WORST service possible. And nobody that works there cares or has the slightest intention of doing better. They survive purely off of their location and that they're open late near a college","2/1/2015",1
"Whataburger","I came here three times and they got my order wrong. I decide to try them one more time. Wrong- so I go in to correct the order only to be met with the chef named Aaron or something saying that it's not wrong. After going through each burger and being mocked he finally admits that it's wrong and goes to make the order. As he walks away I hear him call put the order and it's wrong again! So I correct him and he comes up to me and call me a liar. After showing him my receipt. He finally makes it. The manager apologized but seriously this place blows. It's really disappointing cause whataburger is one of my favorite fast food restaurants. Never made a Yelp review good or bad and this place drove me to downloading the app.","12/7/2015",0
"Whataburger","What-a-burger is a legendary fast food chain in the state of Texas. I've only been here once but I've dreamed about it thousands of times since. This restaurant is flawless. It offers stupendous food and fine dining all in one building. The waiters are dressed in an elegant What-a-burger hat with fresh ironed slacks and a state of the art T-shirt. While I was eating my delectable meal my server, Roderick, went out of his way to compliment my Milwaukee bucks jersey. This is an example of the pleasures  joyful and caring staff provides for you upon your visit to what-a-burger. I hope to cum back to this location very soon and visit Roderick once again and keep our spiritual friendship alive.","2/5/2012",0

"Whataburger","Worst whataburger I've ever been to. The only reason I have gone to this location repeatedly is because it is the closest one to me. I try to hope for the best but always end up disappointed. I've had gravy that was the consistency of water, I've been robbed of a gravy (but was still charged for it), they put little to no bacon on their bacon burgers, and their fries always seem cold. The workers and management don't seem to care about the quality of service that the customers receive.","6/6/2015",0

"Whataburger","Big disappointment as I have recently moved to Texas where beef is king.  If you like salt as flavoring, this place is for you.  Otherwise, a big letdown. As a fast food comparison, tried Backyard Burgers and the quality of meat was better and they seemed to have moved past the salt curing ways of the 1800s.  

Hearing the accolades of W-A-B on the boards, I tried a few locations thinking it might be a specific location issue, but while it was consistent, it was consistently bad.","6/14/2008",0

"Whataburger","We have been to this location countless times, and over the past couple of months, the drive-thru service has gone from mediocre, to ridiculously bad. On 4/07/14, we stopped after work for a single grilled cheese sandwich for our toddler (not the meal, just the SINGLE sandwich was all we ordered). When we arrived, we were the only ones in the drive-thru. We ordered, paid at the first window, proceeded to the second window to wait for the order. After 10-12 minutes of waiting, there is a line behind us, and next to us (this location has a two lane drive-thru), the girl at the window has the gall to ask us to pull forward to a parking space, which I told her NO, all we had was a grilled cheese sandwich. This is not the first time this has happened at this location. I love Whataburger, grew up with them, but it will be the last time it happens, as we will not spend our money at this one anymore.","4/9/2014",0

I went through the drive through and pull up to the speaker . A young man , who was hardly audible asks for my order , no good morning  no hello . That's fine . I proceed to order ,  he tells me my total and I reply thank you  and his response was uh-huh , not even a no problem  or you're welcome  talk about unprofessional geez.  I proceed to the window . The young man then just held out  his hand for my payment , still no hello good morning  no acknowledgment at ALL. I ordered 2 sausage biscuits . When he hands me my food again no kind of acknowledgment, I ask can I have grape jelly please  his response was a slurred it's already in thur  .

"Whataburger","So I've lived in Dallas for more than 25 years and today was my first time at a Whataburger. I can't say that I've been missing much. I guess I don't get the mystique. 

My honey BBQ chicken sandwich was ok. It was not terrible, but I would not say it was good either. It was simultaneously dry and overly sweet. Because it was not terrible I think 3 stars is about right.

On the positive side, the chicken tenders were real chicken.
And they bring your food to you. I guess that's a nice touch.

The cashier who took my order was hard to figure. She either seemed not to care or was internally laughing at me for coming to Whataburger. 

The place was reasonably clean during the lunch rush hour.","4/5/2019",4
"Whataburger","Whataburger is everywhere these days. So you're going to go to quite numerous different ones. 

At this location, come here more then once because it is by my work. It is a decent, ok one. They aren't quite in a good mood at this location. Grumpy, but okay. 

The quality of the food isn't persistent. Sometimes you get hot fries and sometimes they are cold or like warm, not fresh. Same with the burgers, and you have to always double check your order or you will get something you didn't order and have to go inside and deal with the headache. But besides all that, it's a Whataburger and people will keep coming back for more!!","3/22/2020",4

"Whataburger","A true Texas treasure! Whataburger never disappoints.

I keep it simple and order a #1. It's a plain Whataburger cheeseburger, fries and a drink. They have an extensive menu but I like the classics. My burger is always perfect, no matter what location I go to-thin hamburger patty that is still moist, melted American cheese, and the revivalist fixings. The fries are not my favorite because I am not a huge fan of shoestring cut-they're more often than not limp and soggy. Drinks are just..soda, so that's almost impossible to mess up haha. My favorite thing here, though, is the spicy ketchup-it's not at all spicy but it tastes like ketchup with seasoned salt mixed in and I love every sodium filled drop. So good!

Staff at this particular location are super friendly and fast-the entire place runs very efficiently. Love it! If you're looking for a true Texas classic, you cannot go wrong with Whataburger.","7/13/2019",0
"Whataburger","If I could chose no stars I would! That's how bad this location is. You are better off driving to a further location then coming here. Don't waste your time you will only be angry!

It's always a wait. 
What's the point of curbside order if you have to wait 15+ mins after checking in to get your Order? Especially when you placed your order more than 5 mins in advance.
The pieces just came out of the fryer is a bunch of bull the employee gave me.
If you have curbside order, we should be betting it faster than the drive thru. 
Especially when there is no drive thru line.","4/15/2021",0

"Whataburger","I very rarely rate fast food restaurants on Yelp, but Whataburger Lake Highlands rates a bad review.

This location is almost certainly owned / operated by a franchisee...and a bad one at that. They're consistently slow and if there's more than 3-4 cars in line you can plan on at least a 20 minute wait. Not to mention that a Whatameal costs $2 more than any other Whataburger location in the area.

Tonight, even tho there were only 2 cars ahead of me, they still managed to mess up my order. I ordered a double with cheese at the drive thru. But when I got home I discovered that they had given me a single meat with bacon and no cheese. Oh yeah, did I mention that it was cold? Rather than throw away an old order they just gave it to me.

I still love my Whataburger, but am done with this location. Burger King is a block down the road. They cost just as much, but at least they get my order right and don't rip me off.","1/22/2021",0

"Whataburger","This is literally the WORST location. I've been coming here for years and it seems in the last year or two the quality and the team have just become horrid. The fact I'm  even taking time out of my day to rate this place is ridiculous. Put online order in for curbside, waited 20 minutes for someone to come outside and ask what the name on the order was, okay whatever annoying. Waited another 10 minutes before my boyfriend decided to go inside and see what was going on. They hadn't even begun preparing our food, didn't apologize and didn't even acknowledge the fact we waited nearly 40 minutes for our order with half empty fries and onion rings. They almost always forget something in the order and get something wrong. Not to mention this location is significantly more expensive than other locations. There was maybe 2 cars in the drive thru and people who arrived after us received their order before us. Do not go to this location. I hope the owner reads these reviews and can acknowledge that they're hiring completely incompetent people and reevaluate their management.
Once I got home I realized I got the incorrect food and no one answered the phone when I tried to speak with a manager. Had to call the Whataburger help line. 2 stars is generous for this location.","6/7/2021",0

"Whataburger","I came in this location at 3:56 I'm leaving just now at 4:45. We order and paid for our food and waited 20 minutes before asking about the order.( the drive thru was a bit busy) Since it was finally empty I figured ours would be out. They had given our order to someone else. Considering we were the ONLY people in the dining area you'd think they'd realize we hadn't received it. They remade our order and no apologies about it. So we waited again and got our food finally. Oddly the burgers were kinda cold but the fries were warm. Either way I love whataburger so this was just sad.","10/4/2020",0
"Whataburger","I am a whataburger fan BUT shortly after the sell out to a Chicago investor the quality, cleanliness and accuracy of every order started to slip.  Was the decline due to the takeover?  Coincidence?  We stopped going in, driving through.  Shed a tear for our Whataburger decline and blamed it on the sell of  our beloved Texas Whataburger.  Then my husband rolled through the Whataburger McKinney and shared the good news!  Whataburger McKinney clean, order accurate and delicious.  Hey Whataburger Lake Highlands shape up.  Bad training, bad management what's up.  Whataburger anywhere but the neighborhood.  Don't bother.","2/23/2020",0
"Whataburger","For the first time in my life, I drove through a Whataburger. Picked up a few triple-meat hamburgers for my crew at the BETO O'ROURKE for US Senate pop up in Garland, together with some onion rings. The burgers hit the spot, but I must admit there was no way I could finish mine.  It was splendid, I must say. I will drop back to double-meat next time. The two young ladies who took my order and gave me my bag of burgers, rings and drinks were very good natured and friendly, as you can readily see from the photos.  I will be returning, sans skateboard.  I understand why Texas is so proud of Whataburger!","10/12/2018",0
"Whataburger","Based on the already poor ratings I think this location just has lousy management. Backed up drive thru at an off time. Fries and Burger were ice cold and service was just slightly less then pleasant. Been eating at Whataburger for years and is one of only two fast food joints I will eat at. I wanted to blame the issue on the sale to Chicago but it turns out that this one is not run properly. This was obviously a logistics problem and that can only be fixed by training.  So, Chicago Fire your manager here and get someone with skills. Oh and no napkins. Takeout 101. I'm making a point of coming back to this location to see if upper management makes a fix. I give you 6 weeks. If it isn't I am done with your restaurant.","11/22/2019",0
"Whataburger","There's a female up here that wears the name tag angry, she's got a smart ass mouth & a rude attitude when brought an issue that wasn't even made by her but needed to be fixed. I know there's not that many long term employees there but Whataburger as a whole needs to stop filtering these rude ass people into their mix. 

There's a light skinned female cook, she has fantastic customer service & she fixes anything with a smile. I've been coming to the location since I moved into this area back in May of this year & mainly every time they've messed something up. Without hesitation or an attitude on any occasion(she works every time I come, conveniently) she fixes the probably with strong good customer service. I'm unsure of her name but she's great! She should be moved to a higher position with more opportunities than what she currently has!

"Whataburger","This place used to be on point but has gone down drastically. They earth take way too long to get your food to you or its poorly constructed or cold","7/18/2017",0
"Whataburger","Love Whataburger but this location STRUGGLES in the morning. If you're looking for breakfast, and want it in less than 20 minutes keep driving. Only car in the drive through I might add. I'm not the type to leave reviews, but this has happened the last four or five times I've gone.","8/19/2019",0
"Whataburger","Don't go through the drive thru. In line for 15 minutes and it wasn't  long. Got to the window and they had to renter my order","6/7/2019",0
"Whataburger","If you've read my other burger reviews you'll notice that I've given Whataburger the same score as some local heavy hitters. Well, there's method to my madness. Sure, Whataburger doesn't offer boutique burgers the way Goodfriend and some of the others do. And it's decor  is pretty standard from store to store. Theres nothing unique about this Whataburger. You'll get essentially the same product whether you're on Northwest Highway or in Austin.  That suits me just fine. . I don't need to see football jerseys from schools I didn't go to. Just show me where to order. 

But whatever Whataburger lacks in ambiance it more than makes up for it in good, dependable food. Youll get a really tasty burger, fries and a drink for well under $10 with free refills to boot. 

And , wherever  you go in this Great State of Texas, you'll get diced onions on your burger. Gawd, how I love me some diced onions on my burger.","1/24/2014",4
"Whataburger","Everything was fine, until she handed us the food and we asked if we could have ketchup and, then she  Interrupted us saying yuh it's in the bag. Then closed the door, and we looked at her, she opened back up, we said and 2 ranches please. She said that'll be a dollar, we said okay, waiting for her to ring it up. She looked at and said yeah okay and did a shake of her head. Said we'd like the ranch and she again said okay dollar then. So my husband got a dollar out, she took it, gave us 2 ranches and shut the door again and we waited for the receipt. She acted busy, then looked up surprisingly, opened the door and said uh yeah? We asked for the receipt, she said really? You really want a receipt, for two ranches, huh, haha. Then shook her head back and forth while she scoffed at us, with her eyes wide and a smirk, as she rang it up and printed a receipt. Handed it to us, while still scoffing, saying here I guess. Her name on the receipt says she was Linda E. 

Food was great, very excited by the Dr Pepper Shakes. 

But the Employee was not nice in the slightest.","3/30/2020",0
"Whataburger","This is my favorite late night or early morning destination. The food is truly cooked to order and I love love love the taquitos. Potato egg and cheese is the bomb diggity yo! Takes a little while to get once you order it but that's because it's made right then! 4/5","5/3/2019",0

"Whataburger","I don't typically take time to review a random chain restaurant but I was SOOOO impressed with this staff. 
We had been on the road several hours and were starving. It also was the first place we could easily exited going through the DFW. 
Jesus started taking our order and suddenly I just HAD to go to the bathroom RIGHT THEN. My kids had given part if their order but I hadn't. I told him I had to tinkle immediately. He was so patient. 
Then we had special instructions on literally every single order. He put it in perfect. 
They then walked our meals out to us. They were also very understanding that my oldest wanted chicken from the restaurant next door and let him bring it in. 
As we were eating, Bianca was out cleaning tables and asked how our meal was -- telling us she had made it. She asked which of the burgers I had and I told her the bacon w ranch and added avocado. She was like, that burger stood out. She said she gad never seen the combo then that she made the same for herself. 
She talked to us a few minutes while working near us. So kind. 
It's the little things that can even make a chain restaurant special among even other whattaburers. 
The manager should be proud.","12/29/2019",0
"Whataburger","This place is getting worse and worse. There's ONE good night manager and if she's not on shift get ready to have to check your order before you leave.","11/28/2018",0
"Whataburger","It's not just this Whataburger. But all Whataburgers have the absolute slowest drive-thru I've ever experienced. I'm talking 20 minutes minimum with two cars in front of me. It is absolutely ridiculous. Food is good but Jesus Christ they do not qualify as fast food","10/15/2017",0
"Whataburger","My boyfriend and I are huge fans of Whataburger, but this one is an absolute joke. The drive through had like 15 cars in it so we decided to go inside and order our to-go meal. We waited for about 20 minutes for our meal. When we finally got it and got home, my burger was fine but my boyfriend's was totally messed up. To top it off, the fries had no salt on them and were a little over done. We're definitely going to drive farther to another Whataburger location just to avoid this one from now on.","11/24/2019",0
"Whataburger","I have been coming to this Whataburger for the last 4 years since moving into the area. The experience has never been great, but its Whataburger so it can give a pass because I love WB. However, after a visit on 2/27/15 I can't let myself spend any more money at this location.

My wife and I are trying to eat somewhat healthier so I figured I would cut out the drink, & just ordered a burger & fries. I realized that the price different had I just gotten a meal wouldn't have been much more, &  decided I was going to make the change. What happened after that was some of the worst customer service I have ever received.

I asked for the change to a combo and the cashier tells me I can ring you up separately for a drink, to which I replied I would like the combo as that would be the cheaper route. Again she says I have already confirmed the order and I cannot make the change. I asked really was that true, and said you want me to spend extra money because you don't want to edit an order, and more so because I didn't make the change when I placed the original order. I politely declined my food and drove off.

Maybe I'm biased because 17-18 years ago Whataburger was my first job, and I'm loyal to the brand and quality of food. So all the things I learned in the 2 years I worked there through high school were the opposite of this experience. It's just about the principal of doing what's right, and stop being lazy.","2/28/2015",4
"Whataburger","Drive through takes a minimum of 25 minutes. Asked for a 9 piece chicken meal for my daughter and there were 7 in the box. Someone can't count or employees are eating the chicken. Worst Whataburger ever......","9/22/2019",0
"Whataburger","Very clean an nice location
It's a some what long wait for the food order but it's better then a mc Donald's any day for a nice juicy hamburger with grilled onions and jalapeños
The staff is nice, except one of the new cashiers did not know why I waned grilled an raw onions an jalapeños but other then that this location is way better then the others I been to.","5/8/2012",1
"Whataburger","Waited 30 minutes for the food received 3 burgers not even hot and a large fries not even full worst Whataburger ever not even an apology for the time","7/20/2019",0
"Whataburger","I really do like their burgers. That's it, man. 

Being drunk ups the level of goodness.
I find if I purposefully order the wrong thing, I get what I wanted. You know , you gotta give them some room for error because it's fast food. Then again, I'm not asking them to interpret ancient Hebrew text, ya know!

Go get lit and have your designated Wataburger driver get you some alcohol soaking food that you won't remember having but while you were eating it, you lovingly told the burger that  You are soooooo yum.","10/25/2010",0

"Whataburger","Twice I've frequented this What-a-burger for a Sweet & Spicy Burger. First time they gave me the wrong burger and I didn't report it. Today, I asked for extra sweet and spicy sauce and got extra mustard. This time I called, asked for the manager and he apologized and told me I could come back tomorrow for a free burger. Why on earth would I want to return tons store that can't prepare their current promotional burger adequately? Bye Felicia what you could have done was refunded my order.   Don't eat here perhaps then the manager will give his staff a refresher and perhaps next time someone has a problem he'll care about it. His attitude couldn't have been less empathetic or attentive. So no sir I don't want to return to What-a-burger ever. Did I mention I hate mustard and have been in Customer Service for 35 years? I almost never give negative feedback I can't count the time on one hand but I'm done accepting crappy service!!!!

Don't give this establishment your money!","8/11/2016",1
"Whataburger","This is probably my least whataburger in the Dallas area, I've been to 10+ of them. Before today I came a few months early and let me just say the staff was the WORST! They were rude and really impolite. But i guess that's what happens when you hire high school teens. But today was the last straw! I came in to enjoy a meal with my family, so I thought I went in waited in line for about 5 minutes. When it was my turn I repeated my order so many times it made me want to leave at the spot. When u got my food there was nothing but mistakes! I ordered the food to dine-in but they gave me it in a to-go bag. It gets worse, I ordered a kids meal they gave me the wrong cookie, and forgot to give me fries. Last but certainly not least, I ordered a burger and guess what??? THEY DIDN'T PUT MEAT ON MY BURGER!! They didn't even apologized. They gave me the burger all cold and undercooked, so I asked if they can remake the whole burger. It took them 20 MINUTES to give me a new burger!! When I finally settled to eat my fries were cold my drink was watered down my whole family was basically done eating and I was barely starting, and they still had the audacity to ask for receipts when I asked about the fries for the kids meal and cookie!! ABSOLUTELY NEVER GOING AGAIN. Might as well go to the golden chick next to it.","5/12/2019",0
"Whataburger","Forgot to put order in and waited another 20 minutes and still charged me. For my food? For their mistake","4/6/2019",0
"Whataburger","This location has always been clean and the food is pretty good for the price you pay. However, on 3/8/14 this location needed some serious help. First of all let me state this is not a place you want to take your family. The managers are bickering and fighting with one another and if you get a to go order you must check it before you leave, if not you will end up with inaccuracies. I found this out when my whole order was messed up on March 8, 2014. When I brought this to the night manager's attention she agreed to fix the problem. Unfortunately, the day manager believes if it doesn't happen on his shift it's not his problem. I called corporate and quickly discovered the day manager doesn't need to be in a customer service field. It is for this reason I gave this location a bad rating. Thanks for reading this.

Sincerely, 
Robert F.","3/10/2014",1
"Whataburger","Absolutely the worst Whataburger ever.  The rudest staff will certainly jack up your order. When it is right, the quality is terrible. Triple check your orders and be sure to ask for ketchup and napkins, other wise you won't get it. Best advice is to travel west on NW Hwy about 5 miles to a better location.  They should close this dump.","6/14/2018",0
"Whataburger","I am not sure what happened but I think the size of the burgers have gone down.  I ordered a A-1 thick and hearty combo , small.  I got a lot smaller burger than normal.","4/5/2016",0
"Whataburger","Food is good as always, service was less than impressive. The lady behind the counter was fairly rude; she told me twice that she didn't have time to make sweet tea, Meanwhile she's talking to co workers.","8/8/2015",2
"Whataburger","Everyone sat there just talking instead of making the food. The people here aren't very intelligent.","9/28/2013",1
"Whataburger","I sometimes drive through this Whataburger on the way home from work. They recently messed up my order so badly that they have lost my business. Part of my order was onion rings. When I got home, I noticed the bottom of the bag-which was sitting in my car seat- was oily. I go to open the bag and the container of onion rings was floating in oil...which leaked on to the burger and the bottom of the bag. I couldn't eat them, they were dripping in oil. I called the manager but he assured me they couldn't have done that.... He did apologize, but really?? He was calling me a lier. So...I will never return.","10/19/2018",0
"Whataburger","I never thought I'd write a negative review for Whataburger but here it is. It looks like they hired nothing but teenagers for this whataburger and I couldn't see one adult manager in there. They were understaffed and because of that they were really slow in taking and making our orders. It took almost 25 minutes for two orders of combo number two and a combo number 5, nothing complicated by my order. The place was extremely dirty for Whataburger and the bathrooms needed lots of attention. I don't know how the women's bathroom looked like but I can tell you that the men's bathroom had trash all over the floor and the sink had hairs like if somebody had shaved in the bathroom. When I got my order I asked a girl don't you think it took a little long to get my order, 25 minutes long to be exact? All she said was sorry we're understaffed only have two cooks and turned around and walked away. Now I'll give them the benefit of the doubt that fast food places do get a bit chaotic, but a lot has to be said about who is hiring these people without adult supervision and really look like nothing but teenagers were working there. I'm a big fan of Whataburger and I still am. I think they're going through some different ownerships and its trickling down and its affecting the quality of the restaurants but I can guarantee you that I will never be here again. Sorry W this place has lost my business.","9/16/2015",0
"Whataburger","Went today for lunch and burger meat was cold and tasted like it was cooked earlier and Maybe slapped on the grill for a little bit.  Cheese wasn't even melted. This location is always hit or miss. Many other good burger places close by.","8/4/2018",0
"Whataburger","I once visited the drive - thru at 2 ish in the AM. I happened to forget my credit card there and called in the morning to retreive it as I am sure the manager or lady who works the drive thru would have surely put it up in the safe for safe keeping. Well the next days phone call to the store was fruitless and I was without a credit card.  Not to worry though as two days went by the credit card statement showed a new charge from walmart. 400 dollars worth of walmart crap.

pro's - place is open late at night for sustenance

cons - SOMEONE THERE STOLE MY F'ING CREDIT CARD","1/14/2008",4
"Whataburger","Having just arrived here from Atlanta, I immediately put Whataburger on my list of places to eat while in Dallas.  Hey, they don't have them back home, and I'm sucker for silly names, so never mind that they're a run-of-the-mill fast food joint.  I was excited.

Whatadisappointment.  My over-priced burger was practically drowning in mustard.  The fries were so-so, but the honey mustard I stole from my friend who ordered chicken fingers (there was no other around for the taking) did have a tang that made them a little tastier.  Even at lunch time, though, the place was pretty empty.  Probably should have taken that as a warning...

I crossed the place off my summer to-do hours later with that you-know-what-you-did feeling still lingering in my stomach uncomfortably.  To their credit, the service was great (extremely polite), and I hear the breakfast is better.  But after 11 AM, I think I'll stick to Wendy's.","5/21/2010",1

"Whataburger","Curiosity got to me. There are no Whataburgers on the east coast. 

I will say the service was splendid. Everyone was super nice, but after eating I wonder if they were simply pitying our stomachs. It all tasted good enough for fast food, but my friend and I were both still feeling our meals several hours later.  Blehhh

But grease like that makes for the best hangover food, and they are open 24 hours! So there might be a return visit sometime in my future.","5/20/2010",0
"Whataburger","Ssssssssllllllllllooooooowwwwww. Expect a 10-15 minute wait every time. How long can it take to cook a 1/8 inch thick hamburger patty? And If you decide to go in, you will stand there for a couple of minutes before someone takes your order. Go elsewhere.","11/1/2017",0

"Whataburger","Just spent 25 minutes waiting on a taquito, when I asked how much longer they said they didn't know. I asked for a refund and said I would just leave. They said I would have to wait since they didn't know how to refund. Will never go here again","2/15/2015",1

"Whataburger","Got food poisoning from a burger purchased at 11721 East NW Highway in Dallas late on 6-25-16.  Of course, the girl at the window did not include the receipt.  And, the rest of my order was incorrect.  I talked to the manager this evening and, because I didn't have a receipt (wasn't given one), she refused to make it right.  She should have returned my money or exchanged the burger for another food item.  I was given this news after she avoided me and made me wait.  She was clueless about how to work with a displeased customer.  As a result, Whataburger, and not just this store, has lost a customer for life.  The manager has been reported to their corporate office and the Health Dept will be my next contact.  I think that she should have to eat the rest of the sandwich and see how she likes it. I advise the public to avoid this location.","6/26/2016",0
