"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","Guillermo Del Toro's Pinocchio is exactly that, a beautiful and unique interpretation of a classic that explores death and grief in ways that are often emotional and heartbreaking whilst still delivering a fun adventure with gorgeous animation against a classically disturbing Del Toro backdrop.

Gregory Mann gives an incredible lead performance, imbuing Pinocchio with a boundless warmth and naivety that thankfully never becomes annoying. Ewan McGregor makes for a terrific comic relief and is an absolute joy to hear whenever he's on screen.

David Bradley is so good as Geppetto, subtly bringing so much pain to his character that breaks your heart and makes his moments of happiness all the better to experience. Rounding out the cast is Christoph Waltz, on point as usual with another truly evil character.

Guillermo Del Toro's and Mark Gustafson's direction is absolutely phenomenal, everything from the movement of the characters, to their designs and the vibrant colour palette is gorgeous and endlessly watchable. The music by Alexandre Desplat is amazing, giving the film a perfect sense of whimsy for a fairytale.","13 December 2022",10,139,164
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","This film is NOT meant to have the light-hearted happy-go-lucky vibes of Disney's 1940 Pinocchio movie, but rather a modernised take praising the wonders of childhood, faith and friendship; up against the all-consuming tyranny of fascism (its take on Mussolini is hilarious), deceptive show-business tactics; and the double-edged sword of Time (and Life) itself.

Pinocchio is a conceptually HEAVY film that doesn't condescend on its younger audiences nor it's older ones: it respects all the age groups equally and without compromising the story and fairytale-qualities of the Pinocchio story at its core. It's like a hard-boiled folktale that knows when to be optimistic and when to be cautionary in equal measures; and that's the magic Guillermo Del Toro does so goddamn well in SPADES.

This is 2022's best animated feature film, and one of Netflix's best film offerings in years. And it was worth the wait on Del Toro's part too.

All in all, Pinocchio was WORTH IT; big time! And hella better than Disney's 2022 live-action turd too.

It's a 5/5 star experience.","2 December 2022",10,256,314
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","With less than 1/4 of the budget of the soulless Disney live action remake earlier this year, Del Toro & Co. Have managed to craft a version of Pinocchio with more personality, heart, and soul than Disney could have dreamed of crafting.

It injects new life into the character by telling a story that is vastly different both narratively and thematically than any version we've seen on screen before.

This tale deals with the malleability of identity, unconditional love, the impressionable nature of children, and the close link between joy and sorrow. And it does so with dark wit, refreshingly complex three-dimensional characters, and stunningly haunting stop-motion animation.

However, I do think this could have benefited a bit from cutting down on the plethora of plot points and having Pinocchio and Geppetto spend more time together. This version lacks the tight focus and brisk pacing of the 1940 version.

But aside from this, I was thoroughly entranced by this dark fairy tale. It has a spine and a soul, and unlike it's titular protagonist, it's far from wooden.","10 December 2022",8,78,89
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","In case you were wondering what was missing from an adaptation of Pinocchio: 1) more Fascist commentary (not to mention Tom Kenny voicing Mussollini); 2) Frankenstein allusions (or sorry did I say allusions I mean he's clearly so in love with ol' Frank that the imagery is just there in spades); 3) a showstopper Ewan McGregor musical number that hilariously keeps getting interrupted until the ending (you'll hear it at the Oscar's live I bet); 4) the word 'Burden' made existential and harrowing for a child of wood; and 5) and an even more gnarly designed sea beast. It also made me laugh and cry and lay back in awe in my theater - feel lucky if you get a chance to go see theatrical and don't pass it up if you can - at one of the great stop motion animations of my lifetime.

I'm sure there are little complaints or nitpicks I can have - ie as strong and believable and emotional an actor Gregory Mann is for the regular scenes, he's slightly one note as a singer for me. But they mostly pale in this giant work of a vision that is collaborative (Jim Henson productions Co produced and I'd love to know if any of this was puppeteers not just with the stop-motion 24fps), yet del Toro's voice and mind and vision is very potent and daring; that of creating a story of Disobedience in the face of the Big Paternal thing of a Fascistic leaders and so called fathers, and a fairy tale in an Iconoclastic approach (meaning as he said at a q&a it doesn't tell you to obey your parents so you'll be a good boy, it says you should be and think for yourself).

GDT's Pinocchio is a wonderful hot chocolate that deals with parental grief; why Gepetto creates Pinocchio is a prologue that makes this a film as much about him as the title character and what he has to learn. It's loaded with what we've come to love from Del Toro and his collaborators (Desplat especially), and I hope it reaches families all over the world. How young can you watch it? Uh... how young did you see the Disney one? Go a year younger!","3 December 2022",10,112,160
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","A new Guillermo Del Toro movie is always something worth getting excited about, and I think his take on Pinocchio is another winner. While it might not live up to his very best films, it's another strong addition to his filmography... though it's also worth mentioning that he co-directed this one. Mark Gustafson is the other director, and he's not going to get as much credit as Del Toro, being the lesser-known name. But I imagine you don't get credited as a co-director unless you do a good deal of the work, so he shouldn't go ignored.

It's easy to see why this take on the Pinocchio story was appealing to Del Toro. It's a fairly dark fairytale, it deals with child characters in a cruel world, it blends fantasy and real-world conflict (here, it's set in Italy I think either before or at the start of WW2), and it's also a story with big emotions, being heartfelt and also surprisingly sad in places. All these themes/directorial trademarks can be found in Del Toro's other films, which makes this one feel right at home among them (even if it's the first to be animated).

The animation looks unique and is great to look at throughout. Unlike other animated movies with unique looks, I didn't feel like this one took a while to get used to. It pulls you in right away, and I think the music helps a great deal, too. It's overall a nice-looking and nice-sounding movie, with pretty good voice-acting, too.

The fact that it deals with mature themes (surprising amounts of death and Fascism in this movie) and might look unsettling to some, while also having child-friendly comic relief and music numbers do make it feel a bit odd tonally. I appreciate the effort that went into making this a movie with elements that'll appeal to younger viewers, and elements that'll appeal to older viewers, but I'm not sure the variety of tones is always balanced expertly. If I had any criticism, it's that, but otherwise, this is a very good animated movie, and another triumph for Del Toro (and his co-director!).","28 November 2022",8,92,125
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","A father, haunted by the death of his young son, has his wish come true, when he carves a young boy out of a tree.

I must admit I raised an eyebrow when I heard that Guillermo del Toro was doing Pinocchio, having just enjoyed his cabinet of curiosities series, I wasn't sure how this would be, truth is, it's a glorious film, truly wonderful.

It's a kids film seen through the eyes of an adult, that's the only way I can explain it, mature themes are dealt with, done in a way that audiences young and old can appreciate.

It's funny, it's incredibly moving, and as you'd expect it's also a little dark at times. Finally a film that's number one on Netflix, that deserves to be.

I loved the way Geppetto is depicted, he really is a troubled man, even hitting the bottle hard, David Bradley does an awesome job, as do Ewan McGregor and Gregory Mann.

The visuals are terrific, it's a beautiful production, it's different to the norm, but it's so impressive, again I think it would appeal to viewers young and old.

Take my advice, save it for Christmas day, it's a magical experience, one deserving of the special day.

I was expecting to like it, I wasn't expecting to be enchanted by it, it's magical, 10/10.","14 December 2022",10,40,56
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","I really have very high expectation given the trailers and today I watched it and wow this is fantastic I love the visual and animation and the story telling. This is very mature in comparsion Disney 1940s animated version.

The stop motion is beautifully done and the songs is very nice to listen too I like this isn't insulting to older or young audience similar to the film Coraline which fits and this is 100x better than the live action remake Disney done just to cash in all the classic movies.

Overall, there is some issues but this doesn't take way the fact this movie is a masterpiece between amazing story, incredible animation and interesting characters and lovely songs I highly recommend this if you haven't seen it dont watch live action remake version watch this one.

10/10 perfect score.","9 December 2022",10,93,122
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","Hot on the heels of the Disney released Tom Hanks starring misfire that has found little fanfare around the world after its release on Disney+, Netflix's high profile and ambitious take on Carlo Collodi's beloved children's tale courtesy of the overseeing of Guillermo del Toro and his co-director Mark Gustafson is an artistic triumph that successful re-imagines the tale of a wooden boy and his creator/father in a way that brings new life and freshness to a story that unquestionably wasn't in need of yet another cinematic adaptation.

Transporting the fantastical adventure of Pinocchio (hear voiced by Gregory Mann) from the setting of 1800's Italy to pre-World War 2 Italy under the dictatorship of Benito Mussolini and his National Fascist Party, del Toro and Gustafson's tale is a lot more mature and adult-minded than we've seen most times previously in film versions of this tale but as is to be expected from anything with the Mexican artists touch, the film still manages to offer up whimsy, heart and laughter around all the more serious elements that are sure to affect adult viewers here even more than any little ones that give the film a go.

Currently the longest stop-motion feature film ever made, every frame of Pinocchio is a significant feat of artistry come to life and vision explored, with one left wondering how on earth the team behind this effort managed to pull off such exemplary feats of animation to birth this tale into existence and whether its colourful cities, mangy looking monkey sidekicks, rabbit filled underworlds or a belly of a giant sea beast there is no doubt every inch of this Netflix original is right up there with the best of 2022's feats of film-making, making this film as close to a shoe-in as possible for this years Best Animated Film Oscar.

While there is so much to enjoy in a visual and aesthetics point of view not everything else in del Toro and Gustafson's film works to the same high level with some of the films infrequent hit and mostly miss humour (a frequently explored joke of Ewan McGregor's mistreated Cricket grows wearisome), hammer over the head reminder that fascism is bad, Mann's slightly irritating voice work of Pinocchio and most tellingly a collection of songs that feel slightly underused and questionable in a sense that perhaps this film might have worked perfectly fine ditching the song and dance numbers all together, combine to stop Pinocchio from operating in other departments as highly and memorably as it does in a purely artistically viewed point of analysis.

Undoubtedly Pinocchio can be viewed as a success and head and shoulders above the other 2022 film of the same name but when it comes to what cinematic version of Collodi's tale still remains best, the 1940 Disney animation must still be regarded as the king.

Final Say -

An outstanding artistic achievement that fails to inspire the same level of magic and awe as its technical prowess elsewhere, Netflix's Pinocchio is a good film that could've been an all round masterpiece if other pieces had come together to reach the same levels of its artistry.

"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","To start with the most amazing stop action animation, then get to a story of substance, is what makes this one of a kind. Others have analyzed it in such detail. First of all, Gippeto is a tragic figure for most of the film, never coming to grips with the death of his son. He makes Pinocchio but drops into a drunken furor. The church turns out to be an adversary. The people who saw him as a veritable saint now turn their backs. We have the cricket living inside him which is an interesting twist but so appropriate. There are friendships, discoveries, and war to deal with. Also, the little wooden guy has immortality. But is that a gift when you outlive those whom you truly love? I thought this was a sensational film.","18 December 2022",10,25,38
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","Right from the get go there're some loop holes, and themes that seems a bit odd but then it grew on me. While my brain is processing and nitpicking the logic, my eyes and heart enjoys this. After finishing the movie, other than shedding some tears, I don't really feel anything much but entertained. Half day in, the movie is now stuck in my mind. Took me awhile to process the meaning of life I took from this movie, and the beauty, the growth, the love, the treasuring the time we have together, precious time. It is now in a special place in my heart. Hands down the best Pinocchio movie I have the honour of watching, in my lifetime. Thank you.","13 December 2022",9,45,59
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","Guillmero del Toro's Pinocchio is a movie that was cancelled until Netflix helped him revive it. While the year already had a movie on the wooden puppet in the form of Disney's live-action remake (which I felt was nothing more than another in Disney's long line of soulless remakes meant to serve as nothing more than to milk money off nostalgia while changing stuff like making Monstro a sea monster instead of a whale and the clock scene that was done for nothing more than a cameo of Disney's other movies), and let's say the movie does a better job in its own way.

Taking a different direction, the film has Pinocchio made by Gepetto as a way to replace his late son, Carlo, who was killed in the Great War. However, he goes into various misadventures with a cricket named Sebastian, Pinocchio is put on various misadventures.

Yeah, this is a lot different than how Disney's version went, and it's for the best. However, it is not for younger kids, as given the time this adaption is set in, as well as the fact that one of the characters is Death (who is portrayed as the sister of the Wood Sprite, the one who gives Pinocchio life), it can result in scenes that can be too scary or intense for younger kids. However, it brings a new take on the classic tale, and the actors all do a good job, and the stop motion is great.","9 December 2022",10,35,58
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","Geppetto's carved and chiselled a new son, replacing Carlo who was tragically taken, made from fine Italian pine, dovetailed, screwed and fixed with twine, just imagine his surprise when he awakens; as a Wood Sprite's taken pity on this fellow, who's sorrow, grief and sadness make him bellow, taken all internal strife, the grain now imbued full of life, though he won't age, he might just season, but never grow (except for an inbuilt polygraph). A cricket helps, to make sharp edges round, untying knots that seek to limit and to bound, but there's danger in the town, someone else would like to own, it's not too long before Pinocchio's has gone; whisked away, by the unscrupulous Count Volpe, who's recognised a fortuitous, new pay day, a puppet without strings, will make his tills ka-ching and ring, with some swindling alongside a small betray.

A dark and tenebrous retelling of the tale of the wooden boy that introduces some additional tangents and places it during the turbulent times of war and conflict. Great animation, some great dialogue, only tarnished by the fact that it's a perpetually told story, and you know what familiarity invariably brings (if you're of a certain age).","11 December 2022",7,21,34
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","From the get go, this movie had everything going for it. Guillermo del Toro knows how to make a good film, and this was definitely no exception. Now I'm a fan of the 1954 Pinocchio, and I'll say right off the bat that this is not a remake! Don't be foolish and think that, because this is an adaptation of the book more than anything. This movie took some creative liberties, some really good creative liberties, in fact. The movie is set during World War II, in an Italy under Mussolini. War plays a huge role in this film, and I think Del Toro did a good job of taking the basic ideas from the original story, and expanding on them. For example, a certain island setting from the original story is not present in this film, but in its place is a genius substitute that serves practically the same kind of purpose in a way. Every character is interesting and the worlds are very dense with details. While having a dark tone, the movie also finds a way to be upbeat and charming at times. Also, the music is great, the musical songs are pleasing to the ear. Best of all, the visuals are stunning, the puppets capture emotion even though they're puppets. This movie beats Disney's remake by a long shot, and I hope it gets lots of credit for that. Watch this movie if you like the story of Pinocchio, but expect differences and a darker tone. Your kids will like it, and you will love it. 10/10 totally recommend.","20 November 2022",10,139,181

"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","So confused why this has so many good reviews? I'm gonna take a guess and say because it's by Guillermo, who I absolutely adore. Shape of water and pan's Labyrinth are perfect. I even love Devil's backbone. Maybe not Crimson peak so much tho...but I normally love his movies. And you can feel his darkness in this but I think Pinocchio might be the most annoying character on screen ever. I wanted to throw him into a fire. The voice actor was bad for me. He sounded like a snotty kid screaming at his mum in Harrods. And the singing...wow.

Obviously it looks amazing. It's absolutely stunning. But the annoying character and boring story just made me so irritated.","26 December 2022",4,31,49
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","So I must be one of the very few to have never seen the Disney original although it's impossible not to mentally refer to it or think of its famous accompanying songs while watching this remake by Guillermo Del Toro.

Del Toro takes a stop-motion approach to the animation and generally adopts a much darker colour palette for his telling of the well-known story. That also goes for the much-altered narrative with the story planted firmly in between-the-wars Italy and the rise of fascism under the dictator Mussolini although it seems to me, in doing all this, that the director is alienating his younger audience.

It didn't help either that this Pinocchio is so much of a pain-in-the-proverbial when he first comes to life, with an especially irritating voice plus it has to be said, Sebastian J Cricket, by Jiminy, really doesn't register much as a presence throughout the movie.

And then there are the songs which are flat, tuneless and distinctly unmemorable. Of course, they enhance and elevate the Disney feature, but here if anything, they slow down the action. I also found the caricature portrayal of Mussolini to be just too obvious and dull.

It had some nice ideas like Pinocchio's ""Groundhog Day""-type revivals every time he dies and the epilogue is sweetly executed to at least end the film on a nice note but I have to say, on the whole, I found this modern-day take on Pinocchio to be longer than a lying nose and distinctly wooden, into the bargain.","24 December 2022",5,19,33
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","In 1940, Walt Disney released an animated film based on the Italian fable of a wooden boy who came to life, called Pinocchio this version, by many, was considered the definitive version of the. Henceforth, whenever people think of Pinocchio, you then inevitably think of Disney.

I, myself, have never been a fan of Disney's interpretation of the film, it always felt too childish and messy to me, as well as all the racial stereotypes, however, I found the basic story fascinating, with its moral dilemmas and vague veil of horror encompassing the narrative. So, imagine my anticipation when Netflix announce a new adaption of the Pinocchio story, done in possibly my favourite animation style (stop-motion) and by a masterful filmmaker, Guillermo del Toro, whose gothic sensibilities shone in 'Pan's Labyrinth'.

So, it's 2022, the film has released, and, it somehow managed to better than my expectations.

The story, largely follows what you'd expect, but with a couple notable changes: it is set in fascist Italy, it is more spiritual and it is more philosophical. There are a couple more changes, but I don't won't to spoil them here.

The film from the offset is darker and more mature than the Disney original, encompassing themes of war and death within the first ten minuets. It also uses its titular character as a 'puppet' to convey humanity's worst and best impulses, which albeit, the Disney original did too, but in a more 'after-school' way, chiselling down its moral core to a nub of simply 'don't lie' or 'don't get addicted to vices', whereas GDT's version poses more questions than moral lessons.

GDT's version also feels equally more realistic and more fantastical, blending the two seamlessly, and, despite, his change in medium, it still feels and particularly bleeds GDT's style, feeling pulpy and gothic, while retaining its PG family rating.

Del Toro and McHale's writing elevates the story to new heights, the character writing feels very reminiscent of McHale's previous, the masterpiece that is the TV mini-series 'Over the Garden Wall', as each character feels loving crafted to be fully three dimensional, Pinocchio himself feeling incredibly reminiscent of Greg from that very series. However, the scene stealing character is Sebastian J. Cricket, voiced by Ewan McGregor, who, is this version's Jimminy Cricket, fittingly, unlike his predecessor, Sebastian is, at the beginning at least, a somewhat misanthropic writer, focused on writing his memoirs, as opposed to the generally high-sported Jimminy. McGregor's performance here is great, giving a wry delivery to the jokes with an unexpired sense of vigour, delivering some of the film's funniest and saddest lines. David Bradley is another stand-out, bringing life to a sadder Gepetto.

The animation here is simply breathtaking, with puppets from The Jim Henson Company, Del Toro and Gustafson bring the world to life with their intricate and delicate stop-motion and well-placed CG, everything here is tightly framed with a blazing level of artistry and elegance, brought together by stunning cinematography, it feels like two auteurs at their peak. Crisp and efficient editing ties the whole thing up brilliantly too.

The score is provided by the legendary Alexandre Desplat, with a couple of songs too, the score is exquisite, but the songs are the only element that feel like they should have had more time in the oven, other than two, 'Ciao, Papa' and Sebastian's Ending Melody, the rest feel a tad pointless, not bad, but slightly unnecessary.

Overall, Del Toro's Pinocchio is a staggering cinematic achievement pushing boundaries in craftsmanship for both live action and animation, with an intelligent script that honours and diverts form its origins that explores every theme it sets out superbly, making it the definitive version of the fable for me, firmly pushing Disney's vision out of mind. Easily, one of the year's very best, animated or otherwise.","10 December 2022",10,41,63
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","This dark version of the Pinocchio story is exquisitely crafted. Del Toro's vision of a fascist Italy is richly detailed and filled with powerful imagery. The story is deeply moving as Pinocchio, voiced by David Bradley, struggles to stay true to his father Gepetto's wishes while also trying to find his path in life.

The animation style is unique for a del Toro film, blending elements from his other works to create something entirely new. The colours and visuals are stunning, giving justice to the grim world of 1940s Italy.

The characters are distinct and memorable, each brought to life with the help of excellent vocal performances. While Gepetto and Pinocchio take centre stage, their relationship is the true star of the film. The relationship between this father and son is both heart-warming and heartbreaking as Pinocchio wrestles with his conscience and emotions.

The music also adds to the atmosphere, creating an additional layer of emotion that helps bring the story together.

GUILLERMO DEL TORO'S PINOCCHIO is a remarkable piece of art that captures the horrors of fascism and celebrates the bond between father and son. The animation, music, and storytelling are all top-notch, making this an unforgettable cinematic experience. Highly recommended! (NOTE: Parents, take care. This might not be the most suitable movie for young children.)","1 December 2022",8,41,67
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","Pinocchio is a beautiful film that offers a fresh and unique perspective on the classical fairytale, its characters, and the world. With Guillermo del Toro's signature style and a somewhat gloomy tone, it explores deep themes and adds a lot to the story of Pinocchio.

This is another masterpiece in the collection of Toro's films that charms with its visuals. The production design is stunning, while the stop-motion style adds to the overall atmosphere and enhances the unique feeling of the film. The music is beautiful, and the songs feel just in place without distracting from the story.

It is one of the best animated films of this year and is definitely worth watching!","21 November 2022",10,105,146
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","Guillermo del Toro brings his trademark weirdness and new life to the classic tale of Pinocchio. I could not have admired the spectacular stop-motion animation anymore than I did on my first viewing. Every scene looks like a work of art in its set design and detailed characters. The story is astonishingly more expansive here as well, including the story of Gepetto's original son, Carlo, much more focus on the carnies who capture Pinocchio, and a look into the afterlife. Del Toro also tells a cautionary tale against fascism in place of the notorious boys-turning-to-donkeys scene (the joke being the fascists are a**es). While I enjoyed all of these new elements to the story and the phenomenal animation, I was left underwhelmed by the music. I think this movie is thrilling for kids (especially those 10-14 years old) and I would re-watch this again.","12 December 2022",6,11,16
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","Del Toro has created an incredible film! I personally don't feel this is a film for very young children due to the backdrop of Muccilini's fascist Italy. That said,, its not because it is any more violent than a Disney cartoon,, its just far more intelligent and must of the relevance would be missed..
The animation is flawless stop action. Every scene is a work of art and complimented by the charactors' design and seamless movements. Charactor voices are well matched to their charactors. The screenplay is well done, easily followed while still impressive and enjoyable. I couldn't believe parts of the story had me on the edge of my seat. The limited music was ok but unnecessary in my opinion. This film will grab you very quickly. A masterpiece.","19 November 2022",10,63,105
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","4* out of 10*

After watching GDT's latest work ""Pinocchio"" I went online to see if people were as disappointed as I was. Surprisingly, I couldn't find a single professional review that didn't applaud the film as a wonderful masterpiece. If movie critics don't have the balls to say it, I will: GDT has lost his mojo. What started to show in the mediocre and over-hyped Shape of Water and became even more apparent in the over-long and lacklustre Nightmare Alley is obvious after Pinocchio: GDT is not a very talented storyteller - and subtlety is NOT his strong suit. None of the two mentioned earlier films caught me on an emotional level and Pinocchio also completely failed to do so. It felt a bit like it's main character: wooden and without a true heart.

The film might look brilliant on a technical level but even the optical surface lacks heart. I was surprised that supposedly this was all stop-motion, because it felt like CGI all the way. I don't know what it was exactly but the film simply looks too perfect. The characters and scenery never come across like puppets, everything feels animated. Even if they put in years of handy work, I am sure they glossed over all the frames digitally and enhanced the images.

The first twenty minutes of the film were great and showed GDT's potential. However, as soon as Pinocchio showed up, it all went down the drain. If the film's biggest weakness is its main character, you have a problem. I did not like the design and looks of Pinocchio, at all. He looks creepy. Plus, the dude is a completely obnoxious jack-ass who is super-annoying. His voice was particularly bothersome. How are we supposed to root for him? I knew it was over when he started to sing his first song and my ears started bleeding. That song made absolutely no sense. Pino knows perfect English and knows all the words, until he doesn't when the song need him to.

Why was this a musical anyway? Every single song was terrible and the lyrics were so bad. The music added nothing to the narrative but catapulted me right out of the film, as I had to resist the urge to fast forward whenever they started singing.

The film generally drags a lot and could and should have easily been cut about 30 minutes. It struggles to find its tone and therefore its audience. Is it aimed at children? Too dark and all over the place. At adults? Not really dark and emotional enough and too childish.

Another major flaw is the over-bloated, weak script. The story is messy and all over the place. GDT shoves so many narrative threads and sceneries into the film that it completely loses fo-cus and fails to tell a cohesive story. There is the church theme, the carnival, the war camp (?), the Mussolini thread, the fish monster part, the other-world-hell narrative - it's just too much. All these disjointed scenes sure try to bring across a message. And they do so VERY heavy-handed. As I said, subtlety is not GDT strong suit. For example, we all know that war is horrifying and fascism is evil. However, both these topics were handled way better in GDT's early (and ONLY) masterpiece Pan's Labyrinth. This time around, he just crams these things into the film without saying anything new about them. He just shows them and spells them out. The terror of Mussolini's fascist regime is never felt.

Unfortunately, everything is literally spelled out in this film. Be who you are, don't try to be someone else. Don't project your dead son into a puppet. Religion is dumb. War is terrible. Let go, don't lose yourself in grief. Immortality is worse than dying. Lying is bad but sometimes, when it gets you somewhere, it's fine (??).

One gets the impression that either, GDT doesn't truly care about his messages or he simply doesn't have the narrative capacity to convey them in a convincing manner. He kind of picks them up, looks at them, briefly shows them to us and then drops them to pick up the next shiny idea he finds on the ground. For the viewers, this is unsatisfying and left me feeling stale.

One cannot help but have the impression that GDT only truly cares about himself and showing off all he has accomplished while neglecting careful story-telling. This can best be seen by the fact, that he puts his name in front of the movie title. A thing, film-makers typically do once they are past their prime. GDT marvels in the glory of his own name and the technical flex of the animation. This hubris culminates in the casting of friggin Cate Blanchett - only to have her voice a darn monkey without a single word of dialogue.

The Scottish cricket voiced by McGregor is tasked with watching over Pinocchio and providing him moral guidance to become a good boy, which is set-up big time in the beginning. I have never seen a character fail more miserably at their quest. He does not once guide the guy or even speak to him much during the film, for that matter. In the end, he goes like ""Yeah, I did my best, that's all you can ask of me."" and is granted his one wish.

I did like Mr. Filch as Geppetto, though, he did a fantastic job! Swinton and Pearlman did al-right, too.

All in all, a pretty big disappointment.","23 December 2022",4,45,77
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","I will be in the minority with this; as a piece of stop motion art, it is lovely to see, but I found it lacking somehow; it is not quite a children's film, but the conveniences of the plot seem contrived and out of sync with an adult tail. Indeed it is in a different realm to the inferior Disney remake, but it isn't better, in story or art form than the 1940 Pinocchio Disney animation. The voice of Pinochle was a bit condescending; the original film had the benefit of being watchable by the whole family and contained a dark core that gave some moral teaching. Like the Disney remake, this film shows that lying can get you out of trouble, so what is that supposed to be telling any young viewers? I found the ending very touching. When I was 10, I started to read the book, which is undoubtedly a dark tale; I would rather rewatch the original story.","11 December 2022",5,27,53
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","Surprisingly, this is the first form of Pinocchio that have been exposed to. I likely saw the original Disney Pinocchio but I was too young to remember. This version is a far more mature telling of the story, with an all-star cast and gorgeous animation.

This film's animation has had so much effort and care put into it. The models are glorious and expressive, the environments beautifully realised and the imagery is exquisite. Guillermo Del Toro continues to excel with his direction. The voice acting is also top notch especially David Bradley as Geppetto. This movie is as much about him as it is about Pinocchio. The movie deals with themes of loss, grief and the struggle to move on extremely well and the more mature moments are balanced with some good humour. The soundtrack is also superb although some of the songs have some clear uses of autotune.

The characters are all equally memorable. As said earlier, Geppetto is the highlight but Gregory Mann wonderfully portrays Pinocchio and his dialogue is child-like yet brilliant. Christoph Waltz also shines as the abusive Count Volpe and he is a perfect antagonist. However, the weakest part of the story is the fascist element. While it is mostly executed well, I feel the arc for Candlewick, played by Finn Wolfhard, felt as if it was not fully developed. His defining moment just doesn't have as much weight behind it. Despite this, the film still hits hard in its emotional moments, almost bringing me to tears.

Overall, Guillermo Del Toro's Pinocchio is fantastic and one of the best animated films that I have seen recently. The animation is gorgeous, voice acting superb and the soundtrack wonderful. It is well-worth watching and it might be my favourite film from Guillermo Del Toro.","1 January 2023",9,3,3
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free thoughts, please follow my blog to read my full review :)

""Pinocchio retells the famous tale of the wooden puppet through visually lovely stop-motion animation, featuring several bold narrative changes that make this remake more human, emotional, and thematically profound than so many other adaptations.

Unforgettable dialogues about loss, love, and being the best version of ourselves elevate an adventure of self-discovery. The voice cast couldn't have been better, while the (new) music manages to be both playful and lyrically rich.

Guillermo del Toro simply cannot fail.""

"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio (2022) :
Brief Review -

There have been remakes of many timeless tales, but none of them modernised the original work like this. I have lived 10 years of my movie buff life with the personal opinion that Guillermo del Toro is one of the most overrated directors of our time. Be it ""Pan's Labyrinth"" (2006), ""Pacific Rim"" (2013), ""The Shape of Water"" (2017), or ""Nightmare Alley"" (2021), those all have been nothing more than a one-time watchable flick for me. Maybe I need to change that opinion now. Disney's groundbreaking animated flick, ""Pinocchio"" (1940), unveiled the world of the Italian novel ""The Adventures of Pinocchio"" on the silver screen with pathbreaking visuals and techniques, and that's why it has lived for years and continues to live even today. It will be loved for many years to come, but I think people will also consider Guillermo del Toro's remake with it. 5 has not only managed to pull off an honest remake, but he has given it an extension and a modern version that expands its legacy. It is more like an adaptation than a remake because there are so many changes in the script, and all of them are so beautiful. Guillermo starts off by telling the story of Geppetto and his son, which no other film did. Then he gets into Pinocchio and the world war zone, leaving you with a little flavour of Michael Curtiz's classic musical, ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"" (1942). It's a long film-2 hours precisely-for valid reasons. You see Pinocchio's death, again something new and unique; Cricket's arguments; two angel sisters; the monkey's change of heart; and then there is a fulfilling climax that takes you beyond the happy ending you saw in the 1940 animated film. A big thank you to Guillermo del Toro and Mark Gustafson for delivering an extended version of a timeless tale that none of us predicted to be so modern and philosophical. The current social media generation has something to preserve from Pinocchio's World and a lot to learn. Give it a watch, but first see the original to understand why you have more to enjoy this time.

RATING - 7/10*

"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","This is an obvious clear winner for Best Animation, but it deserves to win Best Picture.

It's extremely rare nowadays to be able to watch a movie where it has characters you can really feel and care for/love with a good deep story.

It's even more praise-worthy how it used a painstaking stop-motion animation. As ugly as Pinocchio may look initially, he really is super charming (I want a figure of him!), and you really fall in love with him. The actual boy/actor who did the voice for Pinocchio has the perfect voice/charm and singing! It really captures the innocent naiveness of the character - of course with the amazing stop-motion to go with it.

Pinnochio's singing and music is really nice and touching!

The old man, cricket, monkey, so many likable characters!

Disney's live action remake of Pinocchio, which also came out this year, was a major embarrassment garbage cash grab... there is NO heart in that movie... just superficial visual... just so heartless; you'd expect with a great director like Robert Zemeckis (Back to the Future, Forrest Gump) and Tom Hanks, you'd have a winner, but it was extremely boring to watch. Absolute fail from Disney. A real winner masterpiece by Del Toro showing how it really should be done.

This movie had a lot of praise/hype and despite all that, I still cried and loved it.

I also loved Guillermo del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth (it's very similar about fantasy, war, and death), his ""Shape of Water"" movie I really didn't care for, but Del Toro's Pinocchio has easily become one of my favorite movies.

I love the unique creative take on how it's a coming of age of the old man/supporting characters, thanks to Pinocchio - it's not about changing for someone, but accepting them for who they are.

Hollywood needs to stop with the annoying CG filled super hero movies and go back to its root with real practical admirable effects and good story.

If you're just going to watch one movie this year, this is it.","27 December 2022",9,6,9
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","The animation is outstanding as you would expect on a GDT film, nevertheless the storytelling doesn't fall behind. Guillermo managed to rewrite the legendary story of Pinocchio with his own style. And yes, that means that the movie may have some dark passages for a child, but only to show the real power of love.

Life has death, war and loss, and there's nothing we can do to have our children to live on a place that doesn't has those, but we can teach them to fight them with love.

This is not a Disney movie (and you shouldn't expect that from GDT), so it won't show a world full of flowers and colors, it shows reality. And that means it shows the great power of love, how we can have forever our loved ones on our heart and how they can give us strength to love again, even when they're no longer by our side.","2 December 2022",10,48,74
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","Guillermo del Toro adapts the classic Pinocchio with a few changes. Geppetto is a woodworker in Italy. The single dad loses his beloved son Carlo to bombing during WWI. He buries a pine cone with the body. It would grow into a large tree and a cricket named Sebastian starts living in it. Geppetto uses the tree to make a wooden puppet. The blue Wood Sprite gives it life and names it Pinocchio.

This Guillermo del Toro animated movie has made some changes to the story. The most obvious is the change of the time periods. It does lose a bit of its old world charms, but the relative modernity does give it a fresh angle. It may be a surprising idea, but Pinocchio needs more humanity. In this one, he looks very much an animated wooden puppet walking the Earth. When the Fascists show up, the movie feels awkward especially for a kiddie audience. It definitely has some darker del Toro touches. The ending is rather poignant and that feels very human.","13 December 2022",7,3,5
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","I would say a masterpiece of both the plot and the characters and the effort to make a film of this type with the technique they used. It is not the classic Pinocchio story, in fact, as it is told in the film, it is only inspired by the characters of the story, it is not a faithful transposition, but this does not penalize the film in any way since the story that is told is very beautiful and manages to find itself well in a historical period that doesn't really belong to it, also making irony about this period in a very good way. The film manages to amuse and strike a lot and never bores the viewer, all the scenes are full of beauty and magic set in a very gray era of Italian history.","16 December 2022",10,9,20
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","With this being the third rendition of the pinnochio story in 2022, it's not surprising to here audiences fatigued by the over-used classic storyline. Don't be fooled, this film is not like the others.

Guerillmo Del Toro leaves nothing off the table. A 2 hour runtime for a children's movie may seem long, but I assure you, the film has plenty to keep you engaged. The story juggles with themes that transcend across all generations. It has everything from the subtle crosshairs between Abusive Capitalism and Authoritarian Fascism, to the masculine conflict in the Father-Son relationship, and even just the simple recognition of the fragility of life while appreciating all of its wonderful qualities.

This is exactly the kind of story we need right now. Thank you Guillermo for what may be my favorite adaptation of the Pinocchio story ever!","20 November 2022",10,65,99
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","No pun intended - this is the second Pinocchio movie in the last couple of months. Like with other themes, this was surely not planned (and I am not calling you Shirley)! But this is definitely the better version of the two versions - I did not have too many issues with the other version! And that was because the core of the story is really more than solid.

That all being said, the amount of work Del Toro put into this movie ... is astounding to say the least. There is an extra behind the scenes feature on Netflix ... and while I have not watched it all, the things I saw make it more than worthwhile! Voice acting, puppet work ... special effects, photography, the little tweaks to the story ... there is so much to be enjoyed here ... even for those who already know the story inside and out ... this really was worth waiting for. And hopefully it did not get spoiled by the other movie ... it would be more than a shame .. I won't lie!","14 December 2022",9,3,5
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","Just like Pinocchio, this film looks like the real thing but has no soul of its own - only a borrowed one. The animation is great but the pace is very slow - inexplicably the thing lasts for two hours - and burdened by sanctimonious social messages about how war and religion are baaad. In fact, the whole 'why can't they accept me as I am' thing has become so tired and worn out, no film-maker with any real creativity would touch it.

My advice, don't be snooty about Disney - stick to that version, it really is a classic.

That's all I have to say - really, all there is to say - but IMDB's minimum character quota requires that I also add the sentence you are reading now, which will continue until the little red character count turns gre.","18 December 2022",3,21,48
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","I have always loved Guillermo del Toro, and this movie just proves it to me one more time. Like in Pan's Labyrinth, del Toro uses the movie as a medium to talk about harsher subjects such as fascism, indoctrination of totalitarianism, war, children's slave labour... Around Pinocchio's tale. Pinocchio is the tale that has been the most in my life, probably because of my Italian roots, but also because that innocence of trying to do good, while never lying, has always spoken to me. This movie starts with the story of Geppetto's son, Carlo, that he lost during the war, which made him create Pinocchio later on. This is a story of love, of how an old man can learn to love again after losing so many people in his life, while navigating the fascism that wants him to fit into ""proper"" boxes. It's a story of a little puppet, learning about the world from an extremely positive point of view, and getting knocked down so many times, but never letting anything go between him and love. This is a story that will make you cry, from good feelings, or drama. In my opinion, it is easily be the best Pinocchio's adaptation I have seen, at the same time heartfelt and real, just like Pan's Labyrinth.","5 January 2023",10,2,2
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","Magnifico. A thoroughly imaginative feature with passion in every scene, every frame. This film is what stepping into fantasy feels like. The kind of inspiring creativity we only see fully realized from filmmakers like del Toro, Miyazaki, and Selick.

Yet what elevates this reimagining is not the aesthetic alone, but in how its thematic focus is firmly centered on Gepetto's loss, loneliness, and the meaning of life, death, & life after death. It hovers over some profound and difficult ideas, such as coming to grips with the fact that no one of us will be here forever. It gets pretty dark, and the ending rivals Toy Story 3 in the way it pulls on the strings of emotional devastation.

The film takes place in Mussolini's WWII Italy, presenting a simplified war is good/bad morality tale, while simultaneously digging into deeper themes that contrast the effects a father's expectations can have on a young boy. There is one segment that doesn't quite fit seamlessly into the flow of what is otherwise an intimate story about Geppetto and his son. However, the strong thematic arc still connects everything well. For instance, Gepetto's real son's name in the film is Carlo, which is the same name as the original author of Pinocchio-a beautiful gesture from del Toro that, after countless iterations of the story, he intends to finally bring the ""real"" Pinocchio back to life for audiences around the world.

The score by Alexandre Desplat has some memorable tunes composed fittingly in the Minor key, with heartfelt lyrics all co-written by Guillermo del Toro himself. He dedicates the film to his parents, and has said that his mother was his main inspiration to make the film. Sadly, she passed away just a month before the film's premiere. It is just apparent with each stop-motion frame that this is an earnest and intimate work from the wooden pine center of del Toro's heart.

Personally, this is the best film I've seen in years. I hope it wins Best Animated Film and gets a Best Picture nom. It drops on Netflix this weekend so clear a few hours from your schedule to watch.","8 December 2022",9,20,39
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","Guillermo Del Toro's first animated feature shines with the tale of Pinocchio and Del Toro's imagination aiding the narrative. Fabulous voice cast led by Ewan McGregor & Tilda Swinton made this a worthwhile watch. The writing provides some gem of the moments be it with Carlo & Gepetto early on or when Pinocchio starts discovering things for the first time while Gepetto refuses to accept him as his own.

So Pinocchio's journey to earn his father's approval gets as meaningful as Gepetto's own journey to accept Pinocchio for who he is. Throw in war backdrop, life at a circus as well as afterlife & a sea monster, Del Toro is all set to bring his vision alive on screen. Be it take on religion or war or even mortality, Pinocchio touches every aspect with aplomb.

Definitely recommended.","25 December 2022",7,3,4
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","No question, this is a beautiful film of master filmmaking. My understanding is that although it looks like pure animation, it really isn't totally. It was done in collaboration with the Jim Henson studio, so I suppose it's mostly puppetry filmed in stop-motion photography. The effect is quite enthralling and visually creative.

Technically, the movie is a 10. But . . . Having said that, 15 minutes of this foreboding journey into the abyss is enough. Because I can't figure out who this dark and stupifying version of Pinocchio is meant to appeal to let alone entertain. You can't take kids to see it, or shouldn't, and it offers nothing for any adult 16+. There are themes (like the Musolini fascists and heavy presence of oppressive religion) in this script that either are not in the original (the setting is WWI instead of the late 19th C when the original Pinocchio was written) or I just can't recall; but in any case, they seem out of place in a fairytale, even one with heavy moral messages. Yet the writing here is quite juvenile, making the movie, in spite of its aesthetic appeal, seem ponderous and, well, wooden. On top of it, it's a musical! Yikes.

Full disclosure: I couldn't make it to the end.","10 December 2022",3,22,45
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","Greetings again from the darkness. Looking for someone to create the opposite of a whimsical childhood fairy tale? The obvious answer is filmmaker Guillermo del Toro (an Oscar winner). He has built his career on delivering dark thrillers that dig into the recesses of our nightmares (PAN'S LABRYNTH, THE SHAPE OF WATER). In fact, he's a master of this, which makes his vision of Carlo Callodi's 1883 book a must see. GDT shares a director credit with animation expert Mark Gustafson (FANTASTIC MR FOX, 2009) and screenwriting credit with Patrick McHale. Matthew Robbins has a 'screen story' credit, and of course it all links back to Callodi's source material.

From scene one we immediately sense the different approach than both the light-hearted Disney animated classic from 1940 and Robert Zemeckis' sentimental live-action version starring Tom Hanks released just a few months ago. It's darker and gloomier with a unique stop-action look saturated in browns. We also recognize that GDT has chosen a different timeline, as the effects of one of the last WWI bombs takes the life of Geppetto's beloved young son, Carlo, and Mussolini and fascism are referenced throughout the story.

Everyone knows the story, and the core remains intact - though GDT adds his special touches and twists. One night, a drunken grieving woodcrafter carves a wooden puppet. As Geppetto sleeps it off, the Wood Sprite brings the puppet to life, and just like that, Pinocchio is born and Geppetto has his new son. Another unexpected twist is how much of the film is musical with song lyrics and music by del Toro and the film's composer, two-time Oscar winner Alexandre Desplat. But don't mistake songs for an upbeat movie. It's still dark and bleak, and of course, GDT nails the sea beast whose belly houses Geppetto and Mr. Cricket in the most thrilling segment.

Young Gregory Mann voices Pinocchio and Carlo, Ewan McGregor voices Sebastian J Cricket, and David Bradley is Geppetto. Beyond that, the all-star voice cast features Ron Perlman, John Turturro, Finn Wolfhard, Cate Blanchett, Tim Blake Nelson, Christoph Waltz, Tilda Swinton, and Burn Gorman. No one does fantasy-horror better than Guillermo del Toro, and even with his first foray into animation, delivers a unique look and spin on a familiar story. He even makes it easy to pick up on the Frankenstein (the Mary Shelley novel) influence, so I'll say it again ... don't mistake this for the family-friendly Disney fare you grew up on.

Opens in theaters on December 9, 2022.","8 December 2022",8,9,26
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","Visually stunning, well directed and joyful delight! Guillermo Del Toro films are all great he can't wrong, he's done several horror movies and you can tell although the bulk is a family story. The only aspect I'm not a fan of is musicals but even in this its perfectly mashed unlike others that oversaturated the singing. Pinocchio is very deserving of a nomination in the Golden Globes in the animation category and might win. I don't like to spoil so I will just say there's a little bit of adult subject matter that shouldn't be seen much by kids under a certain age. Usually not as into Netflix as others but damn this is great entertainment!","7 January 2023",9,1,1
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","Make no mistake - this is a visually stunning animation accomplishment with stellar moments and interesting new ideas and themes that seem to haunt del Toro quite a lot.

The biggest difference is probably the change of the original story's setting from the late 19th century to World War II era Italy. Yes, even Mussolini plays a minor role, and his design is glorious.

But even if you're willing to go with the flow and accept all the changes, some things still are a bit confusing. This is a much more mature version of Pinocchio, so why put in so many musical numbers?

Speaking of which - the music was great for the most part, except for the singing. I have no idea why so many modern movies have to resort to such horribly executed pitch correction, but boy, was it horrible here. I'm guessing that mixing engineers with no music mixing experience had to do it, because it's so obvious and bad that I refuse to believe that it was actually done by someone with musical ears. It kinda takes you out of the story if it's a warm-hearted story about being human, but the singing sounds like it was generated by some first generation A. I.

But in the end there are way more positive aspects to this film than negative ones, so don't listen to all those geniuses who take their kids to a Guillermo del Toro film and then complain that it wasn't for kids at all and enjoy an emotional ride with a lot of sad and dark elements, realized with a beautifully designed approach in its design and execution.","10 December 2022",7,5,8
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","This movie is so amazing and I think I cried 5 times during this movie and at the end I was sobbing. I think this is easily one of the best films I've seen this year as it was truly incredible and amazing. Everyone needs to watch this movie immediately as this is a million times better than the awful Disney remake they put out this year. This is one of the saddest stories I've ever seen and it will easily make you cry at the end whenever you see what happens. Guillermo Del Toro you've done it again and made yet another amazing movie.

"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","My Review -Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio (2022)

My Rating 6/10

I am a great fan of Guillermo del Toro's work and after watching the bonus documentary on the making of this animated puppet feature film I only have praise for the technology vision and skill that has been lovingly applied to every frame of this nearly 2 hour feature movie.

This version or retelling of the classic Italian children's story by Author Carlo Collodi written 132 years ago bears only a passing resemblance to the original.

I adore the original story which is also darker than the superb 1940 Walt Disney animated feature which captured the spirit of the story so beautifully.

Earlier this year Disney 2022 presented us with a live action version which I disliked intensely so if we had to have another version I thought Guillermo del Toro would provide a new and original concept which he certainly has .

Unfortunately for my taste the title is a tad egotistical and the first movie to my knowledge that uses the Directors name in front of the official title "" Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio "" and for me it's more about Guillermo and his relationship with his father than Pinocchio .

His vision of Collodi's Pinocchio for me Is more than dark it flatlines and becomes depressing, especially considering the current war in The Ukraine.

Without spoilers it's common knowledge that Guillermo del Toro has set his Pinocchio in Benito Mussolini's fascist Italy . While this is an original concept I'm just puzzled at what age demographic the Director is pitching his vision towards.

I my opinion It's certainly to scary and dark for children and I doubt an adult audience,especially if like me they love the original story will be very impressed.

The only film version of Pinocchio in recent years that I've really enjoyed is the 2019 Italian version by Director Matteo Garrone that starred Roberto Benigni as Geppetto it seem to come and go in a hurry .

I rated that live version a 9/10 it's also much darker than the Disney versions but it followers the original Collodi version to the letter.

It retains the magic and the appeal of Pinocchio which I can't say Guillermo del Toro's new version.

There's some impressive stars voicing the famous characters Ewan McGregor as Cricket without much personality, Cate Blanchett as Spazatura a Dr Who 'ish dalek version of The Blue Fairy with a voice to match and David Bradley as a very crusty Geppetto.

The most important character Pinocchio is voiced by Gregory Mann who does a good job in creating the most petulant unlovable Pinocchio I've ever met ,he's a real brat .

As I began my review I praise the technology and puppetry animation and I enjoyed some of the songs by Alexandre Desplat one of my favourite film score composers I'm sure the song Better Tomorrow's will be an Oscar nominated song.","15 December 2022",6,9,23
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","Really impressive animated movie. It reminds me of Studio Ghibli movies such as Grave of the Fireflies or Nausica. If you enjoy those films, you will like this one. The characters are well-developed, interesting plot and twists. Not like the Disney version. Well executed animation, I would not be surprised if this one wins the Best Animation Oscar. It is obviously darker than regular Disney movies. It is more similar to Japanese Anime movies. Good movie for all ages. Guillermo Det Toro proved once again that he's a great director. Looking forward to see his next projects very soon. Merry Xmas!","18 December 2022",10,4,5
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","The animation and puppetry construction, as well as the set design, are incredible. Storytelling at its finest. Voice actors like Tilda and puppet makers bring this movie to life. I really enjoyed the songs and the voice actors did a wonderful job. Initially, I was afraid the movie would resemble the Disney classic but it doesn't! Mussolini's criticism is not Del Toro's first critique of World War II dictators. In Pan's Laberynth, Franco's regime is heavily criticized as well. This is definitely a must-watch! Great work.

I would only complain that since it's a Netflix exclusive, it wasn't explained properly that it would be released first in theaters. I wasn't sure when and where it would be released. I haven't seen any posters or release dates for the film. Petty, isn't it? Due to this, I fear the movie will not do well at the box office!","27 November 2022",10,36,63
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","""Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio"" is probably the best film adaptation based on the novel ""Le avventure di Pinocchio"" written by Carlo Collodi. Guillermo del Toro wrote a deep script that revolves around the loss of a loved one and facing death, as well as including a social criticism of the fascism that is still out there. One of the great successes is the voice work done by the cast, who provide feeling to their respective characters. Another of the highlights is the perfect stop-motion animation, packed with amazing designs and impeccable work. This work is the best animated film of the year and one of the best in the history of cinema.","27 December 2022",10,2,3
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","Set against the rise of Mussolini, this adaptation of the Collodi story draws parallels with the adventures of the eponymous puppet and the fascist's coming to power in Italy. The stop-motion animation is vibrant and simply gorgeous as the old carpenter ""Geppetto"" lives happily with his young son ""Carlo"" until the war intervenes and he is robbed of his very essence. It is whilst in the depths of his despair that he decides to carve a puppet, and imbued with life by a forest sprite - ""Pinocchio"" is born. Curious, mischievous, rebellious - you just know that the youngster is going to be an handful for his father and his friend the cricket. His skills at dancing draw the attention of circus master ""Volpe"" and soon the lad is caught in an intricate trap that causes him and his ""papa"" no end of trauma. This iteration blends the magical and mystical with the political and brutal in a cleverly constructed fashion. The original story of humanity is front and centre, but the failings of, and challenges to, that humanity are also presented to us as we see the best and worst of human nature displayed. It's a love story, and one of the best, and in the hands of a man who knows how to mix the dark and the light - contextually and visually - so well, we are offered an engaging and thought-provoking version of this far darker and interesting fairy tale. A big screen must, if you can - the artistry is intricate and the Desplat score compliments that well, too.","3 December 2022",7,8,23
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","Making Pinocchio an obnoxious a-hole was an interesting choice. There wasn't one single second where I cared whether he lived or died. There was one moment where he seemed to be dead and I was hoping it was true. Yeah, it was closer to the original than previous versions, but adding Christ and Nazis to the mix is NOT an improvement. Every song sucks. The composer of the music is no Danny Elfman. Worse than The Nightmare Before Christmas in every single possible way. It might have been del Toro's longtime dream to make this but he should have stayed asleep. Gorgeously animated but seriously unwatchable.","13 December 2022",2,32,58
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","With a stellar voice cast, gorgeously tactile stop-motion animation, and a faithful take on the story with just the right tinge of darkness, this is a Pinocchio that works for every age. It's funny, but not without del Toro's strong background in horror being allowed far more than a cursory glimpse of the stage (Frankenstein's there, not to mention references to the director's back catalogue). There are plenty of Biblical allusions, from the temptations of Jesus to Jonah, to name just two.

The only potential misstep, for me, is that I did find that the songs worked as well for me as they seemed to have for others. I wondered if they were essential, stretching the film's running time just a little more than was perhaps needed. Other than it works on different emotional and narrative levels, with much thought to provoke on the nature of love, life and death.","3 January 2023",8,1,1
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","""Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio"" is a stop-motion animated film based on the novel ""The Adventures of Pinocchio"" by Carlo Conti. Featuring the voices of Ewan McGregor, David Bradley, and Ron Perlman, it breathes new life into the classic Italian children's story with a superb blend of poignancy, great animation, and that signature del Toro charm.

Twenty years after the death of his young son Carlo during the Great War, the carpenter Geppetto (voiced by David Bradley) is still unable to move on from his loss and remains in a depressed state. One night, a drunken Geppetto decides to cut down a nearby pinecone tree to carve out a new son to honour Carlo's memory. After Geppetto passes out during the carving process, a blue wood sprite (voiced by Tilda Swinton) appears before the incomplete puppet and brings him to life, bestowing him with the name ""Pinocchio"". The following morning, Geppetto is shocked to find that Pinocchio (voiced by Gregory Mann) is now alive but soon decides to let him learn about the outside world and everything it has to offer a young boy.

After several decades of adapting Carlo Conti's beloved story about the puppet ""Pinocchio"", there is only really one that people remember best - Disney's 1940 animated feature film. This groundbreaking movie helped set the standard of what traditionally animated films could do at the time with its memorable characters, songs, and morals that audiences of all ages can appreciate. Unfortunately, Disney had to tarnish the great legacy of that film with their terrible 2022 live-action cash-grab remake, which contained nothing of what made the original so magical in the first place. However, thanks to the unique vision of a filmmaker like Guillermo del Toro, we now have an adaptation that rivals the 1940 movie in almost every way, with a fantastic stop-motion feature that washes away all the bad aftertaste of Disney's recent offering.

What separates this film significantly from its 2022 Disney counterpart is that it was clearly made with the intent to both entertain and pay respect towards the source material. Right from the very beginning, we are properly introduced to the characters of Geppetto and Carlo, a father and son pair whom share a loving bond with each other. What I liked is that the film actually took the opportunity to show us how close the two really are, with scenes that involve Geppetto reading his son bedtime stories and Carlo desiring to work with his father when he grows up. Then when the inevitable tragedy of Carlo's passing occurs, the audience better understands the grief Geppetto is experiencing over losing his son, which of course leads to him carving a wooden puppet bearing his likeness. This hasn't been extensively shown in other adaptations and it is small moments like this that demonstrate the stark contrast between the actual effort of this film and the lazy, by-the-numbers approach from Disney. In fact, I felt more emotion from this film's first two minutes than I did the entire duration of Disney's poor attempt.

Something else this film greatly succeeds at is its wonderful stop-motion animation. Everything about the way this film operates brims with so much visual beauty that it is hard to look away for even a second. I absolutely loved the attention-to-detail used on each of the characters and setpieces. It is clear that Pinocchio's wooden body has been cleverly constructed in such a way that he will always be the most distinguishable character on screen. No matter the location, Pinocchio always stands out among the various places he ends up, whether it is a bright Italian village or the dark underworld. It definitely helps you understand the painstaking love that went into crafting each frame of this movie. Stop-motion animation is always a long and arduous process that can be draining on all of those involved so I have great respect for everyone who poured their heart and soul into what can be best described as a labour of love. Best of all, stop-motion films always stand the test of time so this movie is going to age really well.

I also appreciate the entirely different time period of this film. Unlike the original novel, which was written and set all the way back in 1883, this film actually takes place within the backdrop of World War II, a time when Italy was under the leadership of dictator Benito Mussolini. With this new time period, we get to see Pinocchio experience the darker aspects of being a young boy during this era, such as his exposure to fascist propaganda and potential drafting into the Italian Army. It is during these parts that we get to see Pinocchio learn important lessons about having free will and the resulting consequences of his actions. Very few movies made today would have the guts to set a children's story during one of the bleakest periods of the 20th century, let alone one that everybody is already familiar with, but all of it works so well. This was a dangerous gamble on del Toro's part, a gamble that thankfully paid off.

All of the voice actors sounded great as their respective characters, with the young newcomer Gregory Mann carrying the film in the lead role of Pinocchio. I liked the enthusiasm Mann injected into Pinocchio's character, who in spite of his initial naivety, soon learns the necessary lessons about the world around him. Ewan McGregor was also a standout as Sebastian J. Cricket, this film's equivalent of Jiminy Cricket. In addition to being Pinocchio's personal guide, Sebastian also serves as the film's narrator, with McGregor's energetic voiceover offering some occasional comic relief whenever necessary. There are also some frequent del Toro collaborators rounding out the cast, such as David Bradley, who appeared in the del Toro created TV series ""Tales Of Arcadia"", and Ron Perlman, who of course played Hellboy in the two films directed by del Toro. Everyone felt right at home in their roles and it was fun to anticipate what each actor could bring to the characters they were voicing.

In a year where we have had not one but two film adaptations of a classic children's story, it is quite surprising to see that the movie with the least financial backing behind it (US$35 million vs. US$150 million) was what won out in the end. It just goes to show that with the correct visionary outlook behind it, you can create something truly magnificent that does justice to the source material. On the other hand, if you have plenty of money but are artistically bankrupt, you will not reap the benefits you may have hoped for. With all of that said, which 2022 Pinocchio film would YOU rather see? A passion project that utilises the intricate talents of everyone involved or a soulless cash-grab that does little more than waste people's time? The choice is yours.

I rate it a solid 9/10.","19 December 2022",9,2,3
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","I'm a casual fan of the director. He has put out some great stuff and some stuff I think is quite pretentious. This was by far and away the best thing he has ever done. My 7 year old and I were glued to the screen the entire time. I could not believe some of the directions this went in. A lot of it was way too over my sons head but he nevertheless loved it. The visuals were spectacular. The story telling was immaculate. How he was able to change the story in subtle and not so subtle ways and yet tell the tale we all know was extraordinary. This absolutely in my opinion needs to win best animated film and it's not even close. It's amazing!","22 January 2023",10,2,2
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","Guillermo Del Toro managed to take a well known story that was already told many times, added his personal touch and delivered an original and entertaining production. The plot obviously is not faithful to the original Collodi's story, and it is more mature, as there are a few historical references and deep topics that children would not be able to fully understand. But if you are a teenager or an adult, this film is definitely a must watch, especially if you are into fairy tales. I really liked the fact that it does not take itself too seriously and there are many parodistic elements. However, there are also many serious and emotional moments. I liked the eccentric character of Count Volpe, who is basically an alternative version of Mangiafuoco, played wonderfully by Christopher Waltz. Cricket is mainly the narrator, and he is the comedic relief of the movie. The original songs fit well, and they are well performed. Overall, the director reached a good balance.

The artistic direction is wonderful. The stop motion technique perfectly matches with the whole mystical mood. The locations are well realized and there was for sure a maniacal attention to details. Everything was on point: lights are spot on, puppets look extremely realistic in their movements and the special effects are well integrated in the different scenes. I was waiting for this one for a long time and I was not disappointed.","22 December 2022",10,2,3
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","A gorgeous, complicated, and very nuanced story told the right way. The movie traverses through new Pinocchio territory which includes overt ridicule parody of fascism, likely the whole point of the original story evidently as Hitler and Mussolini did their mutual admiration and allegiance dance together when this allegory was penned. Pinocchio does a delightful number mocking the wee Italian dictator.

I need to go back and rewatch the film after I understand a little more about Italy and what the social commentary of the time was saying about El Duche.

There's that and there's the remaining wide variety of topics that are highlighted in the film, the uneasiness of war, loss, pain, hope, searching for that which we love. And of course redemption.

We often think of Pinocchio as a carefree boy, naive and an easy mark and kind of a bad boy. Del Toro goes further than that and helps us love Pinocchio for the newly sentient creature he was created to be (by fairies), his purity of love for his father, and (in the interest of time) his desire to be real. And to be loved.

I think this finally is the definitive version of this story and, long overdue and relevant during a time in which we promised not to forgot and to ""assure never more"".

Ps: beautiful score: ""Ciao Papa"" is an eye.","28 November 2022",10,23,50
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","From the director of The Shape of Water & Nightmare Alley comes a handcrafted delight that's rendered with care & consideration and offers its own take on a classic fable without hurting its essence. Pinocchio is sweet, heartfelt & whimsical throughout and comes packed with as much heart & humanity in the narrative section as it exhibits creativity in the stop-motion department.

Directed by Guillermo del Toro & Mark Gustafson, the film marks his first foray into the world of animation yet finds the Mexican filmmaker in control of his craft as the entire look & aesthetics of the picture has his signature all over it. The story does take a while to get going and runs bit longer than required but the emotions it evokes are genuine even if the journey isn't as riveting.

The stop-motion wizardry on display is what earns the film its highest scores and it impresses greatly with its extensive detailing, expressive puppetry & exquisite lighting. Still, for a musical, the numbers don't pack strong enough punch, the plot is also a tad drawn out & poorly paced but del Toro's sincerity is never in doubt and the underlying themes are addressed with clarity.

Overall, Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio brims with passion, affection & tenderness even if only segments of it truly resonate with the soul. Not everyone will be enamoured by the storytelling but the craftsmanship & ingenuity that goes into bringing its world to cinematic life is dazzling without doubt. A story about life & death, love & loss, fathers & sons, this musical fantasy is a visual wonder.","15 December 2022",,2,4
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","""Pinocchio"" is by far one of the best animations of recent years, I went to watch the film full of optimism, since the whole project was led by Del Toro, who is a director who makes few mistakes and manages to express many meanings and sentimentality of stories more ""Macabras"", in addition to always valuing an incredible visual aspect of his works, and this is no different, speaking first of the animation, that is amazing for car#l#o, it doesn't even look like stop motion, it took 14 years of montage and animation, and you can feel the passion of those involved in the final result, in addition to the incredible animation, we have the visuals, which are not cute or in Disney molds, quite the contrary, here we have very real elements, and as we are dealing with an extremely violent and traumatic part of human history, with wars, deaths, oppression and famine, the whole look contributes to this more ""sad"" atmosphere, otherwise the film has a good pinch of black humor and satires of fascist Italy. But one of the great merits is given in the script, Pinocchio is a film about accepting death, the discussion of whether or not to be a real boy takes place in the acceptance of human frailty, we are all going to die, and that is what makes us human, is it? Pinocchio talks about this idea. Pinocchio reminded me of another film by Del Torno, the great ""Pan's Labyrinth"", which in my opinion is still the best film by the Mexican director, a cold and brutal film with a slightly lighter outfit, great film, great story , great animation. 9.5/10.","8 January 2023",9,1,1
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","This was my first time experiencing the famous fable of 'Pinocchio', as incomprehensible as it may sound it's only the truth I'm uttering. I have personally grown up with the likes of Pokemon, DragonBall, and Naruto; in short, the Japanese Anime. Unlike gazillions of children around the globe, Disney narratives were not something I would usually turn to. As a result, Pinocchio and its contemporaries were simply out of contention.

Perhaps that's the main reason why I struggled so much to find my connection with the story.

Don't get me wrong, it is adorable, well made, well dubbed, the animations are crisp, and the score is fine too but somehow as a relatively new viewer, I could not get myself emotionally invested in the narrative not as much as I had hoped for anyways. The shrouded metaphors & messages were plentiful, and whilst I relished those particular facets of storytelling, the lack of emotional attachment acted as a stumbling block in my overall experience.","11 December 2022",6,4,10
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","I loved this film. The realistic aspects of the wooden puppet were very appealing to me, and I grew up with Disney's first version, getting babysat via video as a child... this story is not just a children's tale, and has be used in more adult oriented films like Steven Spielberg's A. I. That said; the film surpassed the latest Disney version with Tom Hanks easily, and even outdid the original Disney 2D animation in the complexity of the characters, the design and animation techniques as well as the excellent work of all the voice actors that immersed one in this fantasy world in a way the kid friendly Disney version couldn't.

"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","I literally only have one complaint. The reimagining is different, but gripping and still true to its source! The casting was flawless! The music and ocasional song meshed perfectly with the moment!

My one and only complaint is the length. It's about 35-40 minutes to long. I won't go into detail about which scenes I thought could use shaving, but suffice to say I found myself looking at the time left and thinking ""yikes, how am I only halfway though this movie?""
I loved it. It made me laugh, cry and ponder many a question about the human soul. Def worth a watch, especially if you have a little time to kill lol.","21 December 2022",7,2,2
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","Guillermo del Toro has decided to create a deeper and more extensive version of Pinocchio. Deeper and extensive in terms of how the movie explores new backgrounds in comparison to other versions, offering a more tragic and realistic perspective of this story without leaving that magical and fanciful essence that most people know. And the result is so positive.

The movie implements stop motion techniques to give life to all the characters, villains and multiple elements of the movie. It is incredible how good this technique has improved in terms of quality, feeling each frame so smooth that it feels like 3D animation.

But, beyond the outstanding visual and technical elements, the story is really well told. However, I felt the beginning very little explored and accelerated, avoiding a major interaction of Pinocchio in early situations of the movie. But, in general, the movie created an excellent contrast and relationship between the characters, generating a very entertaining and emotional staging.","28 December 2022",8,2,2
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","When Gepetto's son is killed in the war, he sinks into depression for years - he plants a pine cone at his son's grave in memory of him. Years later he chops down the tree grown from the cone and builds a boy out of wood, who is brought to life by a sprite. Whilst Gepetto becomes very fond of the boy, he doesn't always do what he is told and starts out on a number of sometimes dangerous adventures with his new father always searching for him.

3rd adaptation in as many years and the only one that is fully animated, this is by far the best nicely mixing a wonderful fairytale with some often extremely dark material, helped along by a Pinocchio's character that is not always that sweet. There's a wonderful array of actors voicing the various characters with Evan McGregor and Christophe Waltz, standouts. The real highlight for me though is David Bradley as Gepetto who really covers the drama nicely plus he can hold a tune. A great piece of animation telling a strong tale and featuring Del Toro's usual streak of dark.","21 December 2022",6,2,4
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","Have you seen Disney's Pinocchio?

Well, this film has similar structure and content to that version of the tale (certainly nothing like the original book).. but with ample changes to it's development to make it a different experience. As a positive, it has a lot of named voice actors! They do a fine job at delivering their lines and their character's personalities across, and the QUALITY of the production and design are very commendable. In fact, creators still using these kind of methods is very reassuring for the medium.

Personally, hearing the words ""a model fascist youth"" was not how I expected to spend my afternoon. Much less a Pinocchio complaining that people like a wooden carving of Jesus better than him. So, I found these and many other details as added layers of unnecessary world-building that made for a ""pointlessly darker"" story without much reason, or connection to the plot of a toy that became real. It seems Guillermo wants to re-tale a lot of stories that don't need further tweaking.. yet he insists. He also doesn't seem to have a personal style, so again, this movie is very Tim Burton-y (reminded of Sweeney Todd, musical style and all). Well, they do say that changing something to a new flavors IS a way to broaden a product's appeal.. but it's a bit too weird for me, and I can't pretend to like it, much less that it was positively memorable.

Judging by the many positives reviews, I'm part of a minority, so you might as well give it a try!","9 December 2022",4,38,147
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","Del Toro once again drops another banger of a movie. Coming off of Zemeckis's film, this is the Holy Grail. First off, the stop motion animation looks absolutely spectacular and is easily the best animation from a film that I have seen all year. I desperately hope this wins Best Animated Film at the Oscars this year. Del Toro made a great decision when he decided to set the film against the background of the start of WWII and the rise of fascism as the film's core message talks about staying true to yourself regardless of what other people or leaders think of you or how you look. The story does take some creative liberties here like removing anything to deal with donkeys and pleasure island and instead replacing them with an Italian Youth Camp which accomplishes the same goal and after having a bunch of Pinocchio adaptations recently a change of setting is very much appreciated. The voice acting from everyone is great especially Ewan McGregor, David Bradley and Gregory Mann. Mann and Bradley especially have some great chemistry together and Mann has a beautiful singing voice. All of the characters are interesting to follow especially Christoph Waltz's Count Volpe who was one of the more interesting characters presented here. The score from Alexandre Desplat is whimsical and wonderful while also having that dark element in there which compliments the tone of the film greatly. The humor also tends to land a lot here as there were many jokes and moments that got me but the film also leans into its darker setting a lot as well with some very heavy scenes here and there. This is easily the best animated film to come out of 2022 so far so definitely check it out.","7 December 2022",8,9,23
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","Guillermo Del Toro's ""Pinocchio"" is a reinterpretation, definitely not a remake.

Rather than the 1940's Disney cartoon, this film's story is heavily inspired by the original Italian novel ""The Adventures of Pinocchio"" written by Carlo Collodi in 1883. The original story doesn't have much to do with the happy-go-lucky Disney cartoon: it's more mature, crueler in some ways, and amazingly deep (including biblical references as much as philosophical ones!). And Del Toro's ""Pinocchio"" manages to capture this very essence while also making it appeal to children and adults alike at the same time, creating a sweet deep tale about loss, grief and, most importantly, love.

The setting of this visually stunning film is spot-on: it perfectly captures rural Italy under the dictatorship of Mussolini. I admit I was not expecting such a historical take on this movie, but I have to say it fits really well and adds new and interesting content to a well-known story.

Basically, just watch it.

Oh, and maybe don't forget to keep a few tissues by your side because, whether you like it or not, this film WILL make you cry. Both sad and happy tears. Enjoy!","28 December 2022",10,4,5
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","Another Pinocchio movie?

I feel like I just saw this movie cause I just did. Disney just once again took one of their classic animated movies and made it a Live action cash cow with their version of Pinocchio which brings nothing to the table and though it was ok was not worth making.

At least Guillermo Del Toro's Pinocchio was bringing a new twist to the character. A new twist that center's around Pinocchio coming to life in Italy during World War 2.

This made for a very dark story. It was strange some of the adventures Pinocchio went though it felt like Mad TV or Key and Peele were trying to pull off some warped sketch. I can't believe how far they went, sometimes.

Plus the animation was prime, very fluid.

Definitely a fine film, despite the musical numbers.","10 December 2022",8,7,19
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","I feel a little heretic by saying this, but Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio is even better than Disney version! This is absolutely perfect in any sense. The script is so deep, meaningful, rich. The way it explores Geppetto's life before Pinocchio is fantastic, and so it is the way it ends the story, a story of life and death, of hate and love. Animation stop motion work is no less than amazing: so careful, skillful, delicate, innovative, with so much character (I strongly recommend to also watch short documentary ""Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio: Handcarved Cinema""). I took a week for writing this because I felt I could not do it in a hurry, but I still feel myself unable to be fair to the greatness of this masterpiece (and having more time will not change it, and I need to rate my 10 anyway). The film is beautiful, moving, but also bringing a lot of dark humor sometimes. It is well done in every element, from animation and cinematography to the perfect script and stellar casting. I loved the design of each character, which all surprised me deviating from my prior expectation and evercoming it positively. Just watch it, as I also intend to eventualy do again many times in my life.","3 January 2023",10,2,4
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","More than an admirable adaptation , it is a hommage and confession.

It is a precious hommage to Carlo Collodi and parents and childhood in its naked behaviors, sensibility, insecurity , generosity and spirit of adventure.

It is a confession because you recognize pieces , so familiar, from Guillermo del Toro universe, in a sort of chain of memories and impressions.

Easy to define it as beautiful. Or as wise Gothic version of the so well known book. But, in essence, it is only a fair portrait of a world , giving attention to its roots, offering provocative historical context and few magnificent scenes.

It is a kick to reflection. And a splendid del Toro.","21 December 2022",,2,5
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","I've seen a few Guillermo Del Toro films and pretty much every one I've thought were impressive to look at but never hit me narratively or emotionally. Mix that with a children's story (I'm not a fan) and I thought there is not a chance I would like this film. How wrong I was. Not only was the animation stunning, as you might expect, it was more than matched by the narrative and its emotional underpinning. It's a simple story that we've seen and heard many times - but the ubiquitous growing nose is used sparingly - almost unimportant to the narrative. All that matters is the emotional bond between a lost soul bereaved father and the replacement 'son' he recreates. The result is an emotional, sad yet heart warming masterpiece. Made me cry. 9 out of ten.","25 December 2022",9,1,1
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","It takes very little to be a good person, right? Guillermo del Toro has once again demonstrated his mastery in handling what is seemingly a children's world, bringing to the screen a bleak and moving story, in some ways closer to the portrayal of the character from the Pinocchio adventures' original book. Indeed, the original Pinocchio is a disobedient, lying, difficult child who, while loving his father, cannot resist the temptations that surround him. He is not a perfect child and he is not a model child. Carlo, on the other hand, is a model child. But both are perfect like they are. And both are worty of the same kind of love. What the film wants to make explicit is a valuable message for children as much as for adults, that is, what is important in life is not being perfect but being good, and being good means doing your best (which is the best there is). It's really as simple as that. While non revolutionary, it is a very sweet message indeed. In this way, Pinocchio is a film that looks at life (and death) very gently.

On the technical note, it is accompanied by spectacular animation, and great aesthetic attention, expressed in the design of the characters, in their movements, and in the beautiful shots. The world the viewer is accompanied into is made with great care and attention, and it is nice to hear the little homage to the Italian language given by the secondary characters exchanging pleasantries. Also well done is the representation of Mussolini's fascist Italy as a historical backdrop, which, going back to the message of the film, also represents the only example of human behavior that really needs to be corrected.","7 December 2022",9,14,33
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","This movie has many great features, that I, as a big fan of stop motion am attracted to. Firstly, it is full of heart, the first ten minutes or so are relative to up's famous opening in quality and reminds me of the movie alot. It makes you sympathise with the main father character 'Gepetto' but as well as this, all of the side characters are very fun and most have story arcs of their own. The stop motion, is, as usual phenomenal, and carries Del Toro's trademark style along with it. The film can also go to some dark places sometimes with the war plot and some villains dying in rather scary ways (usually offscreen) the music also accompanies with the emotions well. Overall a very fun and heartfelt family movie.

Very good 👍","20 December 2022",9,2,2
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio (2022)

I have heard of Pinocchio, his growing nose and naturally, I watched the old Disney cartoon; as I am sure most of you have. So I wondered how good or different can this one actually be and is it worth the 2 hours. I know it's a bit harsh, but I decided to give the film 5 minutes to impress me and at about minute 4, I was hooked. The animation style was just magical and as soon as the voice acting and the music kicked in, I couldn't stop.

While the story carries many core values of the original, it feels different and in a good sort of way. Afterall, it's Guillermo Del Toro and this man wouldn't have bothered himself if he didn't plan on making it good. While it is considered to be a children's story, this version will quickly show you that it has a lot of adult elements making it engaging for audiences of all ages. Of course there is Guillermo's iconic style, that at times threads the line of horror, but because of the joyful voice acting and music, it never completely crosses to the dark side despite portraying some serious themes like death and rise of Fascism.

In addition to looking and sounding good, Pinocchio carries so much meaning on topics like obedience, burden, war and fatherhood which are intricately interwoven into this rich tale. The animation team deserves extraordinary praise as some of the sequences felt incredible considering it was all done in stop motion. I don't think there is any competition to this film in the Oscars animated category and to top it off, it's now one of my favorites from Guillermo. Whether you are familiar with Pinocchio's story or not, give it a bit of time to pull you in and you will end up absolutely loving it.

The style of it is just so unique and yet so Guillermo Del Torro. The characters feel very real and even though it's a pretty long movie (out of my head about 2 hours), it didn't feel to long at all. We even watched the making of directly after that. I also really liked how the story was different than the original story but also felt like it had a lot of respect for the original story. The character and world design is beautiful and also felt very Italian to me

I can't sit and watch through a boring movie of a bunch of white men in suits talking. So boring, so dull.

I don't know what it is about Guillermo del Toro. His movies always fascinate me. They make me feel uncomfortable and amazed at the same time. This is another win for him. I'm gonna have to rewatch this for sure to pick up anything I've missed.","25 December 2022",10,3,3
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","The genius of Guillermo del Toro arrives to give a twist to the children's classic of all time. The new Pinocchio story has the facade of a children's fable, as you would expect, but as soon as events allow it, it becomes a dark and profound film, dealing with themes of obedience, death and sacrifice.

The character design, sets and models are wonderful. The care for small visual, kinetic and narrative details is impressive. Despite being Guillermo del Toro's first foray into animation, stop motion fits him like a glove.

This is one of those movies you don't expect to see in 2022 unless you're a fan of Wes Anderson, Henry Selick, or Tim Burton. It's definitely part of the best of the year, for its execution more than for its story.

Fully recommended for all audiences.","12 December 2022",8,2,3
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","Guillermo del Toro's stop-motion musical Pinocchio, based on Carlo Collodi's 1883 children's book, is like no other you have seen, not the flaccid 2022 Robert Zemeckis live/animation version nor the benign Disney version with its sweet round-faced puppet. Del Toro's version rumbles with tough love that has the burdens we all experience. It adds Italian Fascism around WW1, with the puppet targeted for extinction by no less than Il Duce, Benito Mussolini: ""These puppets, I do not like.""

It's an odd choice of time and place, especially given the recent victory of a fascist-rooted regime in Italy, although the filmmakers couldn't have known the return would happen. For a movement dedicated to strict obedience, this Pinocchio represents clear and present danger. When local fascist functionaries raise their arms in salute, it's scary given their bloody history.

Carved from a pine tree that represented Geppetto's (voice of David Bradley) lost son, Carlo (voiced by Gregory Mann), Pinocchio is a rambunctious, disobedient boy, curious and affectionately rebellious-in short, the kind of independent individualist that could become a world leader. But, alas, he's different from the rest-wooden and defiant, a fine example of people of a different color, creative innovators, and people who just don't fit because they are misunderstood.

Del Toro, co-directing with stop-animation guru Mark Gustafson (animator of Fantastic Mr. Fox), emphasizes the early-twentieth century fascist milieu the little hero faces, with Mussolini and his henchmen determining moves citizens can take. With that encumbrance comes the chance for the little stringless puppet to become a real boy of resolve.

Del Toro imagines a world of eventual equality and inclusion as Pinocchio becomes his destined hero who loves even enemies, such as evil showman Count Volpe's (voice of Christoph Waltz) henchman, Spazzatura (voice of Cate Blanchett), a macabre goblin monkey with a growing love for Pinocchio. Gepetto accepts a wooden substitute for his lost son, and the slightly comic but un charming Cricket (Ewan MacGregor) narrates with some sympathy and sparse wisdom.

Although del Toro could be accused of morphing a Disney-like story into a dark tale of survival, he laces the tale with thoughts like the need to love others for whoever they really are, not what you want them to be and recognizing the cycle of life to death not even a woodland sprite (Tilda Swinton) can change.

"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","This is a wonderful, joyous, often funny adventure through a world filled with monsters, though no monster proves to be more insidious than fascists and those who exploit children. Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio is an adaptation that subversively reworks the original story's intention to teach children the importance of obedience, and instead aims to teach children the utility and moral value in rebellion and self-advocacy, framing Pinocchio's unruliness not as vices to be ironed out, but as acts of anti-fascist heroism. Every interaction any character has with Pinocchio is one in which he bristles against them, opening up wounds, forcing them to relive and confront past traumas that they've opted to bury in their own ways, whether it be through substance abuse, blind submission to authority, or blind nationalism. Every character before meeting Pinocchio is an open nerve for Pinocchio to torment, though through his chipper prodding at social expectations he finds silly and pointless, those around him are able to find healing, and courage. In that way del Toro's version of the story is a direct rebuke to the moralizing of its source, celebrating the unexpected virtues in disobedience, dishonesty, and poop jokes.","16 December 2022",9,4,7
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","As we cry for the ones we love for nights, it could take up to years, but we eventually meet new ones who we get attached to.

""Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio""
A beautiful animated movie that teaches us the meaning of love, friendship, and how important we should keep trying and holding the ones we love and whatever happens we mustn't lose them for any reason, whether it is a huge matter or nothing to say about, either way we have to stick to them.

As for animation, it has a lot of meanings which have stopped in recent years' animations. God only knows why.

I wish to see more animation movies that have meanings in it, so it can grow feelings, emotions, etc... in our kids.","23 December 2022",7,1,1
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","As said in the title, the newest version of Pinocchio is much better than the other Disney reanimation projects. In 120 minutes, the film traverses thematic ideas like maturation, trauma, collective persecution, coercive labor, World Wars, death, and meanings in life. However, with more than enough topics, the movie barely has time to explore each in depth, which is one major let-down in my opinion. Despite that, I am amused if not surprised by Del Toro's personalized interpretation and alternation to the original story, especially with adding a historical background. Don't be fooled by the childly musical components into thinking that the film is children-friendly, for the whale (spoilers) looks like a literal tumor, and it's nostril a throbbing anus -- one thing I love about Del Toro, you never know when his fairy tale is intruded by loathsome figures or the cruel reality. Lastly, whoever casted Cate Blanchett to voice Spazzatura is brilliant, as I cannot be entertained more imagining the great actress doing all sorts of weird grimaces and gestures, trying to make sounds of a baboon.","16 January 2023",7,1,1
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","Guillermo Del Toro's Pinocchio is wonderful. It contains some of the best stop motion animation while being the longest one produced.

All the voices are well casted from Ewan McGregor's Cricket to David Bradley as Geppetto (in a role designed perfectly for John Hurt). Even Cate Blanchett as Spazzatura is on the money.

In typical Del Toro fashion, this one appeals to adults mostly while dropping stuff in which will appeal to kids the older they get. There are some real dark undertones to the movie with Mussolini & War never far away.

The songs are a tad hit and miss with Everything Is New To Me a standout and Ciao Papa a real heartbreaker. Gregory Mann has an angelic voice which sometimes grates but works with the songs previously mentioned.

Guillermo Del Toro's Pinocchio has been worth the wait and is another great addition to Del Toro's filmography.","9 December 2022",8,6,16
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","It's not your typical Pinocchio story. It's filled with death, hope, grief, hard life moral lessons, moments of laughter...and all done with amazing animation. It's dark, yet whimsical. There is rage, love and excitement. The plot was beautiful and the animation, while not technically realistic, was dreamlike and stunning. It was also emotional and hard. I have never much liked any of the Pinocchio movies, but this one won my heart. I do wish there wasn't so much singing, but as it's a dark tale, perhaps it helps to lighten the mood.

I laughed and cried and smiled. I was moved from beginning to end. I highly recommend.","13 December 2022",10,4,7

"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","GDT is great in telling the unique stories where the lead character is out side of this world on the backdrop of some historical time. This time also he does the same. But refreshingly he has chosen the animation this time. The normal folklore Pinocchio has been wrapped up as the base story to tell the viewers the bigger philosophy
"" the burden of love""
The story revolves around the father son relationship the way GDT perceives. The character are very well written and you are able to check the moral compass and their decision driving factors. The love of the country, the love for money and fame and finally the father son love . The story revolves around love. A nice attempt by GDT.","11 December 2022",7,1,1
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","I always liked Guillermo del Toro, so I may be a little biased. Other than that, I'm a sucker for animation movies.

Without thinking too much about it, I watched it with my son. At first I was like ""woah, this is.. different"", but not in a bad way.

Most movies nowadays don't make me feel a lot, and when they do it's mostly annoyance.

Not with Pinocchio. Not with Del Toro's interpretation of it. I'm not going to say too much about the movie itself, because that's been done in other reviews.

Instead I want to say that this movie moved me; I felt sadness, hope, loneliness, and unconditional love. The characters feel real and deep (not in the way they look), and give the feeling they have been through life before this movie came to be.

Do yourself a favor, and give this movie a chance.","23 December 2022",9,2,2
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","The beloved story of Pinocchio gets a fresh new look thanks to visionary director Guillermo del Toro.

Those of you who follow my blog might have noticed I hated the original 1940 version of the film, for various reasons.

While the 1940 version was aimed almost exclusively at a (very) young demographic, 'Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio' is a film young and old can enjoy. Apart from being visually stunning, the story itself is much better. The character motives are better defined and this film is not as cartoonish. There are still a few moments that were indeed resembling cartoon humour, but that's fair enough - since this is a film for the entire family.

In this version, Geppetto has a 10-year old son, Carlo, who dies during an aerial bombardment. By this time the relationship between Geppetto and Carlo was well established and I sympathized with Geppetto. After years of mourning, he decided to carve a wooden doll to fill the void left by Carlo. As we all know, the puppet, Pinocchio, then comes alive with the help of a Fairy, or Sprite. The Fairy also requested a cricket named Sebastian J. Cricket to guide Pinocchio, and promised to grant him one wish in return. This plays a pivotal role towards the end.

In the original film Geppetto decided to send Pinocchio to school just minutes after he became alive. Here, Pinocchio is depicted as a naughty, spiteful 'kid' who lacks discipline, and it is recommended that Geppetto send him to school. This is much more realistic, and makes more sense.

Off course, Pinocchio decides not go to school and joins the circus after circus owner Count Volpe made false promises to him. Count Volpe also serves as the film's main antagonist. What follows is a coming of age journey filled with fun and adventure, tears and laughter, and above all, a very powerful message.

I must be honest, I didn't really like the Pinocchio character, but his unruly behaviour was essential for character development, and a heartfelt finale.","5 January 2023",6,1,2
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","The movie adds some fresh ideas to the original pinocchio move. Where the 1940's pinocchio gives emphasis on ideas such as meaning of freedom and what's the difference between being real and being a puppet, this movies gives emphasis on disobedience towards evil.

Disobedience has always been a muse for Del Toro. Another thing that he depicts greatly is acceptance. Embracing who you are. But while adding these new ideas, he did not lose it's original magic. The philosophy of being real has been modified to another level in this version.

I cried the whole time while watching this movie. The animation was great. But for me the voice acting was a bit down. It was not bad. But it was not as good as the 1940's version. The music also was not that great. It did not have enough magic as such as the origin one.

But in brief the movie was great and worth watching. The movie will give some fresh ideas along with some nostalgic memories.","13 December 2022",8,4,6
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","Guillermo del Toro's ""Pinocchio"" is a beautifully crafted and thought-provoking take on the classic tale. The decision to use stop-motion animation for the film's creatures brings a tangible, almost otherworldly quality to the film, and del Toro's lifelong commitment to practical effects gives his monstrous creations a sense of realism and presence that is often lacking in purely digital creations.

The story itself is decidedly more mature in tone than previous animated iterations of the tale, exploring complex themes of fatherhood and forgiveness. The cast is perfectly chosen, with Ewan McGregor's pompous Sebastian J. Cricket providing a wry and often humorous narration, and Tilda Swinton delivering a captivating performance as both the Wood Sprite and Death.

Overall, ""Pinocchio"" is a must-see for fans of del Toro and stop-motion animation. Its complex themes and beautifully crafted world make it a unique and engaging addition to the director's impressive body of work.","8 December 2022",9,12,34
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","This might have been one of the things I was most excited about being released this year. Guillermo Del Toro always has the highest quality in his production and typically makes some of my favorite releases. Usually, I wouldn't be this excited about something animated unless it was Disney/Pixar. So when the Tom Hanks live-action Pinocchio flopped, I was disappointed. Pinocchio has also been a favorite of mine since childhood. So I prayed that this beautiful-looking Del Toro adaption would live up to expectations. I'll say my expectations were met many times over.

This is Pinocchio like you've never seen him before. But that's a good thing. An adaptation or remake needs to be different from the original. That was the biggest reason Disney's 2022 adaptation flopped. It tried being too much like the original and changed many things that made the original so magical. This also isn't a remake of the classic 1940 Pinocchio. It is a different interpretation of the 1883 novel. I could go on praising so much of what this does perfectly. The fascist Italy setting during the second world war creates an interesting backdrop for why things happen to certain characters. Christoph Waltz should honestly stick with villain characters. Count Volpe is one of my favorite characters Waltz has ever played. This also is not a kid's movie. It could be watched by kids, but many of the themes are things that only adults would understand. Few could take a classic work for kids and turn it into something emotionally complex and beautiful. Del Toro is one of those few.

10/10. An imaginative ride from start to finish. Full of heartbreak and triumph, sure to entertain all. A real contender for best-animated film of the year.","9 January 2023",10,1,1
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","Quick Movie Reviews
Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio
Netflix -1hr 57 mins
Yes, this is the second version of Pinocchio released this year, and that is in addition to the original Disney film from 1940 (among other, less notable versions). This is one is quite a bit different, and much more interesting for the seasoned film watchers which you have all become.

First off, it is an absolutely beautiful film to watch. The producers (Guillermo del Toro and Mark Gustafson along with Jim Henson studios) actually used real puppets for their characters in a ""stop-motion"" form of animation. Background scenes are hand painted and are striking. This version of Pinocchio is more closely aligned with the original book written by Italian author, Carlo Collodi, in 1883. It is far edgier than the cute Disney movie which most of us grew up with.

So much edgier, that some of the themes (mortality, violence, fascism, and warfare) are probably not appropriate for younger viewers. Pinocchio himself is created to look like a rough-hewn pine carving. When he lies and his nose grows, it develops branches and leaves (Yes, it probably should have been pine needles). We even get a brief appearance by ""Il Duce"" himself, Benito Mussolini, as the plot takes us through Italy during both World Wars.

This is a definite must-see. I have to believe that it will garner much attention during the Awards cycle coming soon. Even if you don't care for the fairy tale nature of the story, watch it just to immerse yourself in the artistic renderings and craft.","13 December 2022",10,3,4
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","Whilst the stop-motion animation is good, the film itself is pretty ugly. Pinocchio looks like something knocked up without much thought.

Mark Renton as narrator? He was great for a movie about drug addicts but he kind of lacks the charm required for a movie about magical beings.

The idea that the Church worships a lifeless wooden idol whilst demonising the living because of their same woodeness is interesting. There is indeed a corrupt news within the Church that worships death instead of Life which is what Jesus really represents. In this sense Pinocchio is Jesus. That is, he has the spirit of Jesus in him as do we all - Life.

But it's not a beautiful looking film. It's dark, bleak and sinister. Another reviewer elsewhere says this film is realistic because it is devoid of colour! I don't know what reality they live in but where I live life is pretty colourful.","11 December 2022",5,9,27
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","This movie expects us to believe that old man Geppetto actually had a wife or a girlfriend and she actually had a kid with him - and then she is just gone no mention of her ever in the film. Geppetoo than has a weird relationship with his son, who then dies a terrible death, and he becomes an old drunk who carve Pinocchio in a fit of drunken madness, but thankfully the cricket and blue fairy are there to help him and Pinocchio becomes a wooden boy? What the heck? Then there are Nazi's running around? I dunno. This film is ridiculous and the music is just awful. I turned it off and will never watch again.","19 December 2022",1,13,61
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","This is extremely unbelievable well done, the motion, the dialogues, perfect songs, voice and sound. This is perfection. How can something not alive, looks so ... alive?

Everybody who loves stop motion animation should see this movie. It took 5 years to make it and had a duration of almost 2 hours. Also the making of and behind the scene movies are worthy to see. Although a lot of respect for the crew, it is also the fabulous contribution of Guillermo del Toro who is a real good storyteller.

At the beach, and if you know the main line of the original story this is not a spoiler, is very moving. Applause and salute, and many thanks for making this movie.","4 January 2023",10,3,4
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","There wasn't a hew and cry asking for yet another version of Carlo Collodi's classic tale, but Guillermo del Toro, Co-Director Mark Gustafson and their team have added quite enough to make it interesting. The screenplay (by Del Toro in collaboration with Patrick McHale and Matthew Robbins) is still set in Italy, but during WWII under the fascist regime of Benito Mussolini. There are several other changes, some to accommodate the setting and time period, while others come from this being a passion project for Del Toro.

Del Toro has long been known to be fascinated by objects d'art and other baubles and bits (one could probably watch his remake of NIGHTMARE ALLEY twenty times and still discover new curiosities in the background each and every time). Working with the Jim Henson Company and artist Gris Grimly, the design for Pinocchio is well imagined. The character really seems to be made out of common wood (or as Geppetto calls it: ""Good Italian pine!"") rather than being overly anthropomorphized to look like a little boy. The other figures are also done with flair.

Planting the story during wartime in the 1940s doesn't always work, and it tends to pad out some sections of the movie. The voice work by David Bradley as Geppetto and Ewan McGregor as the Cricket are fine, but, occasionally, Gregory Mann's Pinocchio is anachronistic, too much resembling a modern boy. The vocal cast also includes Cate Blanchett, Tilda Swinton, Ron Perlman and John Turturro (it's convenient to have a good address book). It's not a true musical, but there are some okay tunes written by del Toro and lyricist Roeben Katz; Alexander Desplat provides the music including the background score.

Give del Toro credit - he hasn't 'Disney-fied' his Pinocchio. It deals with mortality and what it means to be truly alive. It doesn't speak down to the youngest children. The bookends are truly impactful. As with all del Toro films, PINOCCHIO is visually appealing. The combinations adds up to a very satisfying production.","14 December 2022",,1,2
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio (2022) is a movie my wife and I watched on Netflix this weekend. The storyline follow Geppetto after the loss of his son and a magical night where a good witch (of sorts) brings his woodwork to life and gives him a new little boy. The little boy has a hard time following the rules and not telling lies taking him down a rabbit hole of trouble. Can the boy's guardian Angel, a cricket, and Geppetto save him from his misadventures?

This movie is codirected by Guillermo del Toro (Pan's Labyrinth) and Mark Gustafson (The PJ's) and contains the voices of Ewan McGregor (Trainspotting), David Bradley (Harry Potter), Ron Perlman (Hellboy), John Turturro (Do the Right Thing), Finn Wolfhard (Stranger Things), Christoph Waltz (Django), Cate Blanchett (Lord of the Rings) and Tilda Swinton (Constantine).

The animation in this is outstanding as is the storytelling, adventures and depiction of the universe. I loved the sisters of life and death and how their characters played off each other till the very end. The cast selected for the voices was also tremendous and very well selected. While I enjoyed most of the characters, especially Geppetto and the monkey, I can't say I loved the depiction of Pinocchio or Cricket. I thought Pinocchio and his look would evolve over time and Cricket's dialogue and ""points"" didn't feel well written. The carnival and paintball scenes were awesome and the ending was perfect.

Overall, this is definitely entertaining and worth a watch, but I think I enjoyed the recent Disney+ Tom Hanks version better. I would score this a 7/10 and strongly recommend it.","12 December 2022",7,1,3
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","The film is beautiful, the characters were we'll made and the voice actors well chosen. The story line however. In my opinion it could have been far darker and not marketed for kids to be able to do so. It seems they wanted to show the true story (which we all deserve by now) but instead they still produced a semi disneyfied version. The movie was long yet somehow felt so short of context/meaning/soul. This Pinocchio revolves around one event he endured and then they quickly and quite clumsily added two more events to ramp up the story a tad bit. But those additions didn't blend well and felt separate from the theme they went with. They managed to make him even more annoying but only when he came to life after than he was pretty well behaved almost adult like. As if he already learned all the lessons we know he was supposed to learn but didn't actually endure them. Overall I wish I didn't see it. Perhaps this will light the fire under other creators to retell all the true story versions stolen and ruined by D.","23 December 2022",5,4,7
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","Still first time watching and i even already dare to say that i like and much prefer Guillermo Del Toro's Pinocchio more than the original 1940 Disney classic Pinocchio (forget about the Tom Hanks version that also came out this year because that is not a good one), and i love the original Disney film, i really do, and the obvious reason is definitely the story, if you want the more lighter story definitely choose the disney version even that still have some creepy dark things in it, but if you want the more serious darker story and for me i think a better story, a real true Pinocchio story that deserved to be told Guillermo Del Toro's way, which they are not afraid to show you everything, from violence, cruelness, a real true event that happened during the time led by Dictator Mussolini, and the most important one is death, makes it in some way more realistic and real and more powerful, Guillermo Del Toro's Pinocchio is different from the Disney Pinocchio, not only from the looks but the personality, people might found this version more childish and sometimes annoying or too much but isn't that what a real child should be especially the one made from real wood and doesn't know anything, i found Guillermo Del Toro's Pinocchio fascinatingly incredible, i really really adore this movie, story perspective was perfect, they nailed the darker and serious theme appropriately and powerfully and it works perfectly, the voice acting was perfect, and of course the stop-motion animation, and i swear to god if nobody told me that almost if not everything was stop-motion i wouldn't believe it because it doesn't look like it, and in a good way because everything just looks smooth and great, and the song also just beautiful and sometimes catchy, it was great, so overall Guillermo Del Toro's Pinocchio is a Masterpiece, it what's the true Pinocchio story should be told and like i mention before i will much prefer this version more than the original, it's one of the best films of the year.","23 December 2022",10,1,2

Throughout the whole entire thing I was constantly awestruck by the absolutely brilliant stop-motion animation, in the same vein as Fantastic Mr. Fox, one of my favorite movies of all time, Guillermo Del Toro's imagination and genius are dripping all over this film, some of the best animation I've seen since Entergalatic.

"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","Pinocchio for an older audience.

Thanks to G. Del Toro we finally get to see more of tale and navigate deeper in characters like Geppetto & the Cricket who do not feel like secondary at all. The story is elegantly told in dark but visually stunning tone, it is very faithfully to the novel & very intelligently interpreted, engaging & even at 2hr runtime it never feels like its dragging.

Ewan McGregor, to me stands out as the voice of J. Cricket, also Christopher Walts ,as a re imagined/clever twist on some characters by Del Toro, fits perfectly.

The war setting was undoubtedly clever, well executed & never mocked ,as sometimes happens especially in animations.

No major flaws for me, the only reason I didn't give it another star its because I felt that Geppetto, for the weigh of the role, maybe needed a more familiar voice. Having said that, David Bradley does a great job, Geppetto's desperation is really well portrait but most of the times he sounds like he is constantly drunk. Someone like Robert Downey Jr would have been a perfect cast.

Enjoy the watch, its a great movie, hope to see more like it from G. Del Toro & we might forget his Cabinet of Curiosities!","12 December 2022",8,2,2
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","When I first read that guillermo del toro was going to make his own take on pinocchio I have to say I was a little worried. I thought it might be too dark and lose the magic of the original disney one. The truth is its not like that at all. And I have to say I enjoyed this more than the disney one because we dont have the disturbing donkey subplot. Ewan mcgregor provides the voice of jimmyny cricket looking more like an actural cricket and gives some good narration, and that guy can sing. Along with david bradly voicing gepetto, who I was also very happy with. I always enjoy the stop motion catagory and am so happy this movie took that route. The direction of the movie, the art and colors it was just all so nice and worked well. With gregory mann voices the famous wooden boy its a wonderful movie altgoether and one I would watch again.","10 December 2022",8,1,2
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","I was expecting a rehash of the same old, same old, but this take is extremely well done and dark. While it has some of the cliche elements of classic pinocchio, it does those particular parts in a way that doesn't feel like a copy of previous iterations. This is very much a movie for both adults and children, lowkey even leaning towards the adult and teen audience. It had guillermo del toro's signature fantasy horror elements in it without being too overwhelming or focused; it almost felt like a darker version of tim burton. This is now one of my favorite animated films of all time and maybe my favorite of the past couple years.","14 December 2022",9,1,1
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","When I heard that there would be a stop-motion Guillermo Del Toro Pinocchio, I was very intrigued by how he would turn such a well-known story into his grim but heartfelt style: and with Pinocchio, he did an exceptional job in every aspect.

I could sing praises about every aspect of the film: all of the voice actors fit their roles perfectly. Sebastian (the cricket) brings a great warmth, Geppetto feels so natural, Pinocchio is so innocent, and so on for the entire cast. Additionally, each of the characters I mentioned gets to perform at least one song, and they all sound wonderful. All of the music for the film was done with woodwind instruments and it really gives the movie its own unique sound.

I really loved the world of this movie: the character designs were exceptional. You are able to feel for the tragic old Geppetto, Mussolini's physical appearance is a great gag, the whale is terrifying, all of the designs fit right into this strange and beautiful world. I also very much enjoyed the more unearthly elements of this world: the designs of the spirits is very unique, the world of the dead is creative, it all just somehow works connected to the backdrop of World War II fascist Italy, a time period I would never have guessed could work so well with a Pinocchio movie.

This movie is near perfect in my eyes, an excellent stop motion animation which is up there with the greats. I highly suggest you watch the Netflix video about the creation of this movie afterwards: it is insane how much fine work went into the creation of the world, the characters, the story, the environments, all of it. I highly recommend this movie, although do not be fooled- this may be an animated movie, but that is just the medium- this is not a movie aimed at children. While some older kids will enjoy the beauty and fun of this movie, there are very dark themes and visuals, so be prepared to have a talk with them afterwards. But don't let that hold you back from seeing this lovely piece of art!","12 December 2022",9,2,3
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","Synopsis

Stop motion animated version of the famous tale of Pinocchio. Directed by the mind of Guillermo del Toro, who makes it clear that it is his own look at the story of Pinocchio.

It is the perfect adaptation for these times, that is what the new film by Mexican director Guillermo del Toro conclusively depicts. The director signs one of the best animated films of the year and surely also one of the best films of the year.

A story full of allegories, with that unique look that the director possesses, is the perfect mix for us to enjoy a tremendous film that transports you through all the available emotions you may have.

With delicate work on both the character of Geppetto and Pinocchio that lead us to the imperfections of parents and children. A journey through the constant learning of how to be parents and how to raise with all the good and bad that surrounds the world and in turn how to receive each teaching that those who have the longest journey in life give us.

Once again, the director places us in a story that houses the war as a great companion in the background. The mastery with which the director confronts the war as a great enemy is what penetrates the strongest into the story we are seeing. He also does not skimp on bringing the great core of everything we know about Pinocchio, but always giving it a new look that allows the story to feel refreshing and current.

A beautiful job is the one that Guillermo del Toro and the entire creative body behind this film create. The magic and triumph of Stop Motion is the most comforting of what the director proposes to us. An artisanal work that leads us to fall into the magic of its director's mind with the greatest satisfaction that we can have as spectators. What the director proposes is pure authenticity, it is a life story brought to our eyes and to the deepest emotions that our soul can contain.

The songs are beautiful and their script, a strong message that receives both adults and children with all the emotion of touching a fiber that reminds us of something from our lives. The authenticity of the true story of love, loss, education and life is the path to which Pinocchio invites us in the dark and the daring of an entertainment that is still hopeful, full of humor and humanity.

It is a film that deserves to be seen, enjoyed and loved in this 2022.","12 December 2022",8,3,6
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","The newest rendition of the tale is brought to us by Guillermo del Toro and Mark Gustafson and is set against the backdrop of WW2 Era Italy under the Fascist control of dictator Mussolini. At first, I wasn't too sure about the decision of putting the story of Pinocchio in a real world historical context, but by the end, I believe I see what Guillermo and crew were trying to go for and see the relation between the title character and the setting. The animation, needless to say, is wonderful and is so fluid at points that you forget you are watching stop-motion animation. Guillermo also utilizes the best aspects of the character to tell a touching (and admittedly sometimes dark) story that both children and adults can appreciate. The plot could've used a little work as I questioned certain directions the story went, but I thoroughly enjoyed the end result. Whether it's as good or better than the classic Disney film is debatable, but I can safely say it is the best adaptation we've gotten since then. Final verdict: 8.5/10.","30 December 2022",8,1,1
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","As of this month, acclaimed fantasy filmmaker Guillermo del Toro has released his biggest passion project to date, his own retelling of Carlo Collodi's classic book series Pinocchio. Released to Netflix in time for the holiday season, the film reimagines the famous story in 1930s Fascist Italy, as well as taking influence from artist Gris Grimly's illustrations. On top of Grisly serving as co-producer and lead character designer on the project, the talents of co writers Patrick McHale and Matthew Robbins shine on screen in a film far deserving of its current acclaim. It's safe to say that this is one of the stronger Pinocchio iterations out there.

The film follows the story of Italian puppet maker Geppetto, who is so heartbroken by the death of his son Carlo that he builds a wooden boy called Pinocchio. Once Pinocchio is given the gift of life, he learns about love and disobedience while struggling to live up to Geppetto's expectations, discovering the true meaning of life. From the very start, the themes of childhood wonderment and societal demands are made clear as the film's setting is emphasized in its war grown setting. What could've easily turned into a truly dark take on the story ends up with a lot of whimsy and heart thanks to Pinocchio's curiosity affecting both himself and the people around him, complete with genuine consequences of whether he can truly live or not. Much like del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth, the blending of surreal fantasy and tragic warcry actually holds the story together, as for every fun filled moment in the wooden boy's life, there's a grueling reality he has to face amongst his own country. By keeping the theme of being oneself against the expectations of others, this iteration of Pinocchio remains as faithful as ever.

As for the cast of characters themselves, they are not only defined by their roles, but also their actors. Gregory Mann provides a lot of joy and angst portraying Pinocchio amongst David Bradley as the more realistic yet frightened Geppetto. One can see from their chemistry how difficult it is for them to bond as father and son based on who they are and how drastic their current situation is. Speaking of father and son, a bigger example of demanding too much from your kid lies in the fascist government official Podesta and his son Candlewick. One wants his son to be a war bled man regardless of what Candlewick wants to do, and Ron Perlman makes him menacing through so much determination. On the most lighthearted side of things, the narrating Sebastian J. Cricket acts as a spiritual guide for Pinocchio despite him only being able to do his best, and Ewan McGregor clearly had a ball bringing this bright storyteller to life through heart and soul. On top of many other characters that aid the plot in wanting Pinocchio for their own needs, the cast truly make the feature intense in many different ways.

Now it's time to delve into the true highlight of the feature: the animation direction and musical accompaniment. In recreating the look and feel of 1930s Italy, during its then prominent fascist rise no less, the environments scream authenticity down to the core of posters, village houses and forests. By translating the gritty rough look of Collodi's artwork, the characters appear naturally believable and grotesque and move with believable humanity that the acting comes through the performance, especially in regards to Pinocchio's simplified yet broad expressions. The effects work is also a nice touch, with a lot of attention to detail in the compositing of each different layer, lighting element and overall effects piece in place of the specific scene. In addition to Alexander Desplat's enchanting score, the few musical numbers sprinkled throughout offer some nicely touched choreography and subtly placed motion to allow the character to say something on top of merely putting on a performance. Whether or not this film's production was done during the pandemic, everyone's efforts paid off gorgeously.

In a day and age where family films are lacking in risk orientated narratives and maturely dark themes, Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio stands as a remarkable achievement in both stop-motion animation and bold cinematic storytelling. Regardless if you're familiar with Collodi's book or other iterations, this film is a must watch for anybody this holiday season, let alone any day of any given year. It's only a matter of time before this feature becomes a true classic in years to come, for its heart lies in how much it dared to tackle so many serious themes through integral fantasy, and that alone makes it a truly gifted work of art.","11 December 2022",9,1,2
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","My daughter summarized it well when midway through the movie my son said: ""he is so ugly"", in reference to the character of the circus owner in the film, to which she replied ""have you seen anything in this movie that isn't ugly?"". And while some exceptions apply (such as the scene of the sculpting of the Christ in the church), overall Del Toro's Pinocchio primarily stands out by its pervasive ugliness. Intentional? Creative? Maybe, but to what end? When Francis Bacon paints disturbing images, he is trying to convey a pessimistic view of the world. But making Pinocchio as ugly as this film is? Just lack of taste.","11 December 2022",3,11,30
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","A very different take on ""Pinocchio"" which, despite the inevitable cuteness, (those awful kid's voices, some terrible songs), is also much darker than expected. Producer, co-director and co-writer Guillermo Del Toro has chosen to set it in fascist Italy, (Mussolini himself is a character), and death, real and imaginary, is never far from the surface. It certainly looks amazing and is something of a technical marvel but both children and their parents will surely miss the fairytale magic that made the Disney version unique.

This might well have seemed like a good idea but that mixture of cuteness and ghoulishness never really gels and its all-star cast struggle to bring it to life, (Ewan McGregor makes for a very annoying cricket). I'm also not sure young kids will get it nor am I sure adults will appreciate Del Toro's messing with familiar material. Indeed it's something of a mess if, at times, a brilliant one.","27 December 2022",5,1,4
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","A somewhat average reworking of the Pinocchio storyline, slightly better than the previous Disney remake which came out earlier this year. Del Toro is always an interesting talent, although his best years seem to be long in the past and this film does nothing to challenge that opinion. The stop motion effects are novel but they do look like CGI here which diminishes their appeal somewhat. The voice cast is distinguished and well chosen although I wasn't a fan of the kid doing Pinocchio's voice. Inevitably del Toro adds a few dark elements to the narrative and some engaging creations, but overall I still felt this was rather twee.","29 December 2022",5,1,7
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","A great re-telling of a classic story. It improves the source material and gives it new meaning. It's beautiful, the acting is great and the directing is on point. The writing faulters a little bit at times but it's for the most part well written. It is emotionally engaging and moving.

Synopsis:
Academy Award®-winning director Guillermo del Toro and award-winning, stop-motion legend Mark Gustafson reimagine the classic Carlo Collodi tale of the fabled wooden boy with a whimsical tour de force that finds Pinocchio on an enchanted adventure that transcends worlds and reveals the life-giving power of love.","11 December 2022",8,1,3
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","Wow, this was so well made. I read that it took 1,000 hours to film this! They did so well, it looks amazing. I also can't get over the fact that Cate Blanchett literally plays a monkey that doesn't talk and just makes monkey noises!

The story was very different to what we know, and as expected it was darker with some war thrown in there. I still think it's totally fine for older kids from around 12 years old.

I found it to be super cute, sometimes sad, sometimes smile inducing. There's a lovely message behind it, the voice acting was well done and I am a teary mess at the end!!

I don't expect it to be the exact same as the original story, but I gave it a 8 as there were a few things that I feel were a bit too different.","1 January 2023",8,1,2
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","The way this movie gently touches your heart in such an unique way that only Guillermo Deltoro could do,
It's simple and yet deep and sad and full of meaning.

You can see how work there is behind and how detailed everything is.

It truly is a masterpiece that will stick with you forever, it's very different from the original version but that's why it's so perfect, from the plot, to the way puppets and creatures are made, everything is so magical and unique, I can't stop thinking about how amazing this movie is and I'm so happy that the future generations will be able to grow up with this version of the story.","14 December 2022",10,1,1
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","Never going to see another Guillermo del Toro film again. Too many disappointments like Crimson Peak and The Shape Of Water 2017. After the first two Hellboy movies he's lost his groove and now he's making kiddie movies???

Speaking about ""Pinocch"", just stick to the first animated feature film by Disney made in 1940. Masterpiece, and words won't do it justice. Just watch it again and again and again...never gets boring.

Back to this film: reputedly it's a stop-motion animation. When the whole world is C. G. I. This dudes is going back to roots. Well done in that sense. Ray Harryhausen was the master of stop motion animation and you should see all the movies he worked in.

Apparently this is a much darker version of Pinocchio and perhaps Tim Burton missed his chance at directing this. This is not Guillermo del Toro's forte. He should have instead given us Hellboy 3.

Verdict: if you've nothing better to do then watch this. The only other option is watching paint dry.","17 December 2022",1,8,58

** ** **

Story & Theme
Winner for me - Toro's Pinocchio
The original story of Pinocchio is obviously a classic, and Zemeckis' live action adaptation was done amazingly and loosely well, heightening the adventure aspect of the story. BUT...I do feel that the themes were not as adhesive throughout due to the focus on Pinocchio's day of adventure vs his day of learning while on this adventure.

With Toro's adaptation, I appreciated the colorful darkness of the story, especially taking time to give a story of Geppetto's son. Thematically, the film focused on the relationship between a father and a son, expectations of boyhood/being a boy, the spirit of being a child, and the consequences of childhood and adulthood intersecting.

** ** **

Pacing
Winner for me - Zemeckis' Pinocchio
So honestly, I think both films had solid and appropriate pacing for the story they were telling. When it comes to Toro's adaptation, pacing felt a little choppy and rushed in regards to the relationship between Pinocchio and Geppetto. Some of the frustrations by Geppetto weren't fully justified based on the knowledge we had of Pinocchio, in my opinion.

With Zemeckis' adaptation, the adventure focus gave it that extra nudge forward for me. Though pacing sort of took over thematic followthrough, it did move the character through situations to at least check off the tasks given to him by the Blue Fairy, while also being super engaging.

** ** **

Character Arc
Winner for me - Toro's Pinocchio
As mentioned with my pick for best story and theme, Toro's adaptation put effort into the character of Pinocchio. He wasn't just a means to move the plot, he was written as, what seemed to be, a ""real live boy/child."" It reminded me of the most recent Child's Play remake where the film gave space to this unknowing and ignorant character to actually learn and pick up habits with help in making sense of them when possible. Even Geppetto had more purpose and range as a character than in the original.

Zemeckis' adaptation, though loose, was loose for the engagement and adventure, not necessarily Pinocchio. From the very beginning, Pinocchio was an upstanding puppet looking to do right, and none of the situations really brought about enough tension for him to be swayed either at all or for too long. The moment that stands out most is Act Three with the Pleasure Island which I would've liked to have seen showcase a more faithful version of Pinocchio.

** ** **

Creativity
Winner for me - Toro's Pinocchio
The setting. The backstory to Geppetto's son. The more ""realistic"" adaptation to the Pleasure Island climax of the original. And the overall production and storytelling medium. All things that should be admired and given due props, in my opinion.

With Zemeckis' adaptation, I wouldn't say creative liberties were taken, which is probably because the owners of the story were also spearheading the adaptation-so why take creative liberties with their original concept, when doing it ""live action"" is ""creative"" enough...maybe??

** ** **

Entertainment Factor
Winner - Zemeckis' Pinocchio
By default, if I were to suggest one to watch to the general public, it would be the Disney live action adaption. I chuckled more during my viewing, the visuals are great, and the focus on adventure really helps with engagement, so it's the most accessible of the two. I also loved the Pleasure Island song.

However, for viewers looking for story and substance, I'd definitely suggest the Toro adaptation on Netflix.

** ** **

Overall, my pick between the two is #TorosPinocchio which gives Pinocchio of 1940 - meets JoJo Rabbit - meets Up - meets The Curious Case of Benjamin Button

Both are definitely interesting in their own way due to their individual creative paths, but I genuinely appreciated the depth that Toro applied to the Pinocchio story.

Also, the score for Toro's Pinocchio sounds like quality, and Erivo's When You Wish for Disney is stunning.","24 December 2022",8,2,4
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","Third time lucky, I guess. Following the worthless live-action reskin of Disney's Pinocchio and that absolutely unhinged Pauly Shore movie, Guillermo Del Toro's Pinocchio (full title) is the third and best Pinocchio joint of 2022.

Now it's a lushly designed stop-motion film that sticks closer to Collodi's novel than the other two versions -- complete with giving the Talking Cricket (Ewan McGregor) the name Sebastian instead of the expected Jiminy.

Parents should also be aware that, true to the tone of the book, this film has its share of disturbing moments; the eponymous wooden boy gets damaged at several points and looks like something out of Svankmajer's Little Otik during the scenes of his birth. The movie also isn't shy to speak plainly on the evils of Fascist Italy -- while nowhere near the sort of imagery Del Toro put forth in Pan's Labyrinth, it is still possibly a bit too heavy for kiddies. Having said this, it also has the occasional attempts at making the material more crotch-dumpling-friendly, which may annoy some viewers.

Still, with first-rate animation and the vocal talents of McGregor, David Bradley, Tilda Swinton, Christoph Waltz, and Cate Blanchett in the role of a lifetime as a many-voiced simian, it's certainly a delight to watch and listen to, if sometimes a bit predictable -- which, admittedly, is more to do with the age of the source material. The songs didn't really grab me either, but I recall ""Everything Is New to Me"" and ""Ciao Papa"" as being fairly enjoyable tunes.

Weird nit-pick: At one point, a fascist officer (Ron Perlman) sings the praises of his son (Finn Wolfhard) by dubbing him a promising ""fascist youth"". Maybe I'm not well-read enough on the lingo of Mussolini's Italy, but in my experience, fascists don't use that term to describe themselves, especially not favorably. (In my experience, it's something they call other people when said people criticize them on Twitter or tell them to stop saying slurs or whatever.)

So yeah. Foul! Unrealistic movie! -100/10! Also, not enough Pauly Shore noises.","11 December 2022",7,1,2
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","It's a great film. Actually I was tired of Pinocchio's films, as it always depicts the same story, however this one introduces a more emotional storytelling and an astonishing soundtrack. As soon as I realized this would be a musical, I thought it would be boring, but I was wrong.

Although they all have Pinocchio's characters, I think The Talking Cricket, Geppetto, Candlewick, and even Pinocchio are all far more human and emotional than any Pinocchio film. The way Stop-motion is done and the scenery are build, tehy bring all the magic and the power which surround us. The winged creature shows conform and an unknowning vibe that creates all the fantastic atmosphere we don't see in the other related films.

Throughout the story, we travel with Pinocchio through his contemplations and hardships, as well as Geppetto's struggle to reunite him with his family.

The ending is moving, the cycle is complete and the truth of life is revealed.

In an incredible film, Pinocchio comes back to life in the most original way.","21 December 2022",9,2,2
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","So in the first act I was like this is easily a 6 and by the second act it really started to connect with me and was a solid 8 but the third act just really got a hold of me and didn't let go.

It's very rare I give out a 10 to a film or movie but this was so amazing, beautiful and emotional that I really feel like this is a classic that will always be amazing.

At its core it's a father and son story about lose, hardship and acceptance. A much better telling of the classic story then Disney's and whatever that abomination that Tom hanks did. Is a little more dark, more grim but it's real and the stop motion is amazingly smooth.","13 December 2022",10,2,3
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","This is a wonderful reinterpretation of the original story. The stop animation is very smooth and well executed. It was very impressive to see.

The backdrop is Italy between the world wars. Del Toro again immerses you into his vision. This is not a young kid's movie although I would argue it's a family movie. Yes there is an anti-fascist message, but nothing is hammered into you.

All the performances were spot on. You will especially be engaged and moved by Pinocchio and Geppetto as it should be. Even the songs were a perfect part of the story and did not detract from this masterpiece. Enjoy this better version of the 2022 Pinocchio's!","19 December 2022",9,2,2
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","This version of Pinocchio is my favourite that has ever been shown on screen. The original Disney animation is, of course, also excellent but I prefer the slightly more mature take that Guillermo del Toro has splashed onto the tale.

The animation is brilliant, the voice acting is great throughout and Pinocchio's character possesses all the annoyance that comes from true innocence. This last factor is of course what makes up the crux of the story.

It's difficult not to compare this film to the recent Disney remake. I don't hate that version like many do, but there's no doubt that Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio is superior to the 2022 Disney film in almost every single department.

The fantastical elements (of which there are plenty, as you would hope) are a joy to behold. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this movie for even a moment.","11 December 2022",8,1,1
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","This is how the story of Pinocchio should've been told from the start. Right from the beginning, despite the magical themes, a tone of gritty realism is established. Del Toro's magical Italy is just as wonderful and mysterious, and tragic, as you'd expect. There's enough pain and loss and real consequences to the story that I wasn't sure how del Toro would end it.

That being said- what comedy and lighthearted moments as well. The characters are charming, the story captivating, and the pacing masterful.

And the ANIMATION!

I have never seen such convincing DIRT or WATER stop motion.

The grime on the monkey's hands. The water droplets that run down the crickets arms. The way Pinocchio first moves like a machine before he learns to mimic humans.

This is an incredible feat for the world of stop motion puppetry and animation.

And an all-around incredible addition to cinema.","17 December 2022",9,2,2
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","Pinocchio Review

I think what differs from this movie versus other remakes is that it wasn't a remake at all, it felt like it's own story whilst keeping the same characters. This can't be said about a lot of reboots and sequels nowadays.

What I didn't like about the film, like the ugly (in my opinion) animation style, it makes up for in heart. Geppetto and Pinocchio's relationship is the highlight of the story.

Whilst I don't want to go into spoilers, this film is really sad at times and had me tearing up. The soundtrack definitely added a lot to certain scenes and the movie as a whole, which is to be expected by Alexander Desplat, who is an absolutely amazing composer, and he brings his A game.

Another thing I loved about this film was the antagonist, the puppeteer. Very rarely do I feel physical anger towards characters as movies play out. This definitely occurred towards him.

Overall, Guillerman Del Toro's Pinocchio was an emotional rollercoaster ride that feels more like it's own story then just a ""remake"".

8/10.","10 December 2022",7,1,1
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","First up, this film looks stunning, seriously, you have to see this, it looks incredible for stop motion. The voice acting, lip sync and score are all top notch.

Now, on to why its a 5 and not a 10.

Pinocchio, as a character, is just incredibly irritating. As a mid 30s man with no kids, he might just be the most irritating child ever written into a movie. Every single scene he isn't part of is incredible, and every scene featuring him is a aural assault of grating dialogue and constantly wishing someone would just throw the little wooden horror straight onto the fire.

So yeah, beautiful film, solid story, utterly ruined for me by the supposed main character and how he's been written to be the worlds most mewling sproglet.","24 December 2022",5,2,3
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","I am not a big fan of Pinocchio as a whole, but am a big fan of del Toro and stop motion, so I gave it a try. It is just beautiful. I tend to be a fairly stoic watcher and even I needed some Kleenex at some points. Just a visually, conceptually, and emotionally beautiful piece of work.

Also, the absolute best part of this film is the cricket's hiking pack. Like, what does he have in there? Where did he find it? How does he manage to hop while wearing it? Does a cricket really need a bed roll? There is an entire prequel that can be written just exploring the cricket gathering his supplies to venture off!","12 December 2022",10,1,1
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","Guillermo del Toro had a really long journey during the production. This was the exact direction he has been wanting to do with his own adaptation. And his dream has finally came true. Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio is the best adaptation since the Disney version. There of the adaptations did try to do something different for the story of Pinocchio, and some of them have failed terribly. But this one had a story that was different in the best kind of way. This would feature a really exciting journey of what Pinocchio himself would go through. This would have some of the best stop motion animation ever put in a movie. This would have charming characters that stand out brilliantly from other adaptations. This would have songs that would add great detail to the movie's storytelling. And this would have a powerful commentary on war and fascism. Honestly, this movie has been released at a perfect timing since there actually are wars going on in another country. I know we have gotten a couple of bad Pinocchio adaptations this year. One is a direct-to-video film that many say it's laughable, and the one that could be the worst live action Disney remake to date. As for this one? Probably the only one that was released this year that's an absolute must watch. I can promise this movie will leave you heart warmed the way it tells its own adaptation. Not only is this one of the best stop motion movies in recent years, but probably the best animated film from Netflix since Klaus. Guillermo del Toro, your parents would be very proud of you. And I look forward to your future films.","12 December 2022",10,1,2
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","I was very curious about this movie by guillermo, oh boy i was shocked how good this was. The dark tones were a great creepy adition that will probably scare a few little ones. The claymation of this movie is epic, the details in this are outragous. The best part was that it had meaning, feeling behind everything. The humour was epic - i was in hesterics when i heard some of them, and its a solid reason why i would never have kids!!

Absolute rollercoaster of a movie, had me feeling weird evil tones, with humour, light and sadness with feelings of joy at the end. This is one of the best movies ive ever seen, i barely give out ten stars but this gets full ten. Do yourself a favour and watch this without any epectations.","19 December 2022",10,1,1
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","People, please. He doesn't make good movies. He is like Shyamalan: its all meh. Just because he chose Pinocchio doesn't mean anything. If anything, it is cheating. Why? Because anyone can make a Pinocchio, and no matter how bad it is, you will always make your money back.

To be a good filmmaker, you have to take something that we don't love, something that we don't want to see, and turn it into something good. To take something good and turn it into some thing OK, doesn't make you a good filmmaker.

Stop watching, and stop paying for, lame movies. This includes lame writers, lame services, lame directors. Don't let the sunk-cost fallacy compel you.","26 December 2022",1,15,48
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","2022 was a weird year as we had 3 different versions of the Pinocchio story.

We had 'Pinocchio: A True Story' which had a fruity voice and was laughably bad.

We had Disney's Pinocchio remake which had no heart and soul whatsoever. A clear cash grab.

In comes Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio which completely blows both of those rubbish adaptions out of the water. With stunning stop-motion animation, a darker tone, and a more emotional story with a meaningful and bittersweet message.

Guillermo del Toro makes many changes to the classic story that keeps it fresh. It's clear passion was put into this and the final result is magical!","13 January 2023",8,1,2
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","The animation is wonderful as is obvious per the Instagram shorts.

The plot is a sappy ""let's learn a lesson"" machine where Pinocchio asks obvious questions like ""why is fascism bad?"" every five minutes, usually evoking a cringy soliloquy about, e.g. ""all father's love their sons, even if it doesn't seem like it"".

The classic plot is contorted into an awkward machination with lots of rules and regulations revealed to the audience by, yes, gooey monologues. It lacks both charm and creepiness, and at the end it all dissolves into something utterly lame a la Barney.

Big disappointment, big waste of amazing animation.","26 December 2022",3,4,10
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","""Since the stop-motion consists of an array of singular wooden puppets emulating humans and animals, in the center, Pinocchio, himself a wooden puppet, is given a less human-like, more primitive configuration to distinguish his fine-grained timber conformation, and the film is an unmediated labor of love from all the animators and puppet masters, replete with astounding creations and faculty of this time-consuming and time-honored technology, bolstered by sleek, masterful editing, edgy VFX, Desplat's soul-inspiring score, and a copacetic voice cast. McGregor's cricket Sebastian is an eloquent narrator, his mellow register and singing is especially soothing, newcomer Mann's euphonious rendition of the melancholic song ""Ciao Papa"" becomes an entrancing ear-worm.""

"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","I have a few friends, actually I have very few friends, I've just counted I have no friends, and spend all my time writing reviews to fulfil what little enjoyment I can get from my pitiful life. One-of my so-called friends ( see above) told me in glowing terms how emotionally draining Pinocchio was after he watched it and blubbered like a big sissy not once but twice during the film. After watching the film, which was expertly made, the film did leave me feeling that it was all a bit wooden. The main star is played by a actor who lives in fear of a box of SwanVesta matches he's that wooden. The subplot in the movie of Mussolini and the fascist in Italy is interesting, no fairy tail I've ever seen features goose stepping fascist. Luckily the ever wooden Pinocchio evades all his troubles and becomes a real boy. I won't worry about giving away any endings, we all know the story of Pinocchio don't we? Ps my friend is no longer a friend on the strength of his recommending and blubbering on watching the film. I will now have to call him a very loose and casual acquaintance, actually I won't even call him that. I've disowned him he's dead to me now, gone up in flames just like Pinocchio should have done when he was first carved.","31 December 2022",7,1,2
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","It's fitting that this story of a hand-crafted wooden boy who is brought to life by the magic of an ancient spirit is itself comprised of hand-crafted wooden-looking characters who are brought to life by the patience and skill of a plethora of underpaid and overworked animators. 'Guillermo Del Toro's Pinocchio (2022)' (I'm not a fan of having the director's name in the title, by the way, especially since he's actually only the co-director of the piece) is nothing if not beautiful, with its breathtakingly tactile aesthetics clearly being the best part about it. It's a fairytale in the traditional sense of the word, one not just of rainbows and wishes but also of darkness and grief, and this is reflected in the way that it looks. With splashes of scariness and dashes of the uncanny, the picture constantly plays with the assumption that its source story can only be one of wonder and whimsy (though, to be fair, there has been some grimness in most adaptations of it). It's a treat to behold, for sure, even if some of its visuals don't quite meet the standard it sets for itself early on (such as the water, which seems to be a straightforward computer-generated particle simulation, for instance). Unfortunately, the narrative doesn't quite have the same effect. In many ways, the film is somewhat disappointing, primarily because of its rampant tonal inconsistencies and the uncomfortable push-pull between its slapstick humour, musical numbers and sometimes saccharine sweetness and its underlying rumination on fascism, grief and mortality. This is one of the rare examples of a movie which would genuinely be better if it wasn't a musical. The songs are generally uninspired, with weak melodies and undercooked lyrics, and their accompanying sequences tend to take the steam out of the story due to how blindsiding they often are (their infrequency makes it easy to forget the flick is a musical at all). Plus, Pinocchio is just straight-up irritating for most of the runtime, and I know that's the point but it undeniably makes things less compelling; annoying by design is still annoying, after all. The experience is honestly a lot better before he first springs to life. The plot takes some really strange left turns at times, seemingly to force in a predetermined theme rather than elaborate on the themes already present within the source story (or, at least, the version of it that most people are familiar with), and it leaves things on an affirming yet oddly downbeat note that feels a bit off in retrospect. Despite the narrative issues, though, there are plenty of entertaining segments and the vivid brilliance of the animation ensures that even the least engaging moments are always enjoyable to look at. Plus, Ewan McGregor lights up the screen - or, I suppose, speakers - whenever his cricket character chirps his way into the story, which sadly occurs far less frequently than you'd hope it would, and the other voice performers deliver strong work across the board. Ultimately, this is a disjointed affair that's often jarring thanks to its wild shifts in tone, but is just as often stunning thanks to its meticulous visual design and animation. It doesn't quite live up to the hype, if that matters, and I'm a little unsure as to how much I actually like it overall. Still, it's a solid enough effort that may fail to outdo its Disney forefather (and I'm not talking about the live-action remake), but still stands on its own as something I can see plenty of people getting a lot of enjoyment from.","15 January 2023",7,0,0
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","Yes I will anger some people but, sorry I thought this to be one of the worst versions I've seen. Even Robert Zemeckis' version was better even though that was incomplete.

Stop motion is old news. It's not valid anymore. It's like the Amish who choose to live the way they do, and that's a very fringe thing. Stop motion is s choice del Toro made, but it's a very fringe thing to do.

As well as the stop motion I found it very distracting that Geppetto's hair was like carved wood. And the colours throughout were harsh and garish.

Even the faces had no aesthetic appeal, it's as if Del Toro was fantasising about how Tim Burton might have done it.

The story just didn't appeal to me and all the famous headline actors in the film can't lift a poor film. I gave it a 3 but I'm not even sure it deserved that.","30 December 2022",3,2,9
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","A truly ugly and unsatisfying Pinocchio. What worked well enough in del Toro's fascism-laced nightmares Pan's Labyrinth - The Devil's Backbone - does not work here at all. Add to that del Toro's questionable and sometimes unnerving voice choices throughout and a wholly bratty, unworthy and unlikable Pinocchio stop-motion design and you've got the makings of what passes nowadays in Hollywood for greatness. Did anyone there actually ever read Carlo Collodi's original book, an inspired masterpiece of heartfelt imagination. Who is the audience for this del Toro arrogance? Would I take my kids? Certainly not. Would I see this twice? I'm sad I saw this even once.","17 December 2022",,6,18
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","The tone of this film adds to the story and the lessons. It's a good movie to sit with your children and watch. Though somewhat dark, the darkness is an effective tool used to convey the gravity of the story and setting. And most fairy tales are pretty dark in their original tellings.

The artistry and passion that it took to bring this into fruition is nothing short of awesome. The attention to detail is incredible as well as the scale used for each of the designs was dictated by making sure that the emotion and impact of each scene was as required to make the scene effective. Do watch the short about that feat as well.","14 December 2022",9,1,1
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","The movie ""Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio"" is simply a delight to watch. Do not watch this version with the innocence of the Disney version. This movie is more elaborate, with much more context and depth. Del Toro uses the Stop motion animated filmmaking technique in which objects are physically manipulated in small increments between individually photographed frames. This technique visually collaborates a lot with the theme of a puppet boy who comes to life. Del Toro's Pinocchio is darker, having a political background during the fascist period of Mussolini's Italy, but even so, he retains the talking cricket, the monkey, and the fairies. The movie is technically perfect, and riveting with beautiful musical scenes.

This is a must-see movie!!!!","16 December 2022",10,1,3
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","I am and have always been a huge fan of Guillermo. He NEVER misses, and this didn't change with Pinocchio. The immaculate detail and incredible heart breaking storyline was over the top incredible. The big discussions that they touch upon in the movie are so well finessed into a family movie. The fact that this is STOP MOTION IS INSANE. So so so much detail went into this movie and it payed off.

Guillermo never misses. He has been a part of my life since I was a child and he was such a big influence towards my love of film. This has made it to my top ten favourite movies and #1 favourite stop motion film. I cannot recommend this movie enough. You will laugh, you will cry, you will feel so much and you will enjoy every second of it.","10 December 2022",10,1,1
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","Guilhermo del Toro makes a personal interpretation of Collodi's classic bringing the story from the end of the 19th century to fascist Italy. In this way, the puppet who wanted to be a real boy ends up confronted with a world where reality is expressed in a particularly adverse way and the qualities and defects of humans acquire a very particular dimension.

On the other hand, the magical element underlying the story has, as you would expect from the author, a much darker character than the original. Being an essentially children's work, we are not facing a return to the terrible universe of Pan's Labyrinth, but the tone is dark and fascism returns, in what seems to be an obsession by del Toro.

An original version of the classic, intelligent and with an undeniable author's stamp.","17 December 2022",8,1,2
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","This is a masterpiece. It did justice with the story for the first time. All past movies seems unworthy beside this. It doesn't just follow a fairy tale like past movies, but it also depicts the bigger issues in families.

It doesn't only educate kids, but it also parents. It's not only for kids but for whole family. After watching the movie you love your kids more, you're ashamed of any bad words you said in anger. The movie makes you wise as well as your kids.

The whole 2hrs were a joyride on the other side, it didn't let me yawn or loose interest at any point. This is memorable and indeed best gift for the holidays.","13 December 2022",10,3,5
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","Disappointing. Couldn't suspend my disbelief or get lost in the magic. Yeah I know it's an animation.

The character and behaviour of Pinocchio is just irritating and annoying. Worst of all he is voiced by one of those upper middle class drama school types that they seem to use for everything these days who overacts his way through the whole shebang. Just irritating.

Plus they do burst into song sometimes.

Plus it's all a bit predictably, patronisingly preachy.

It does get better as it goes on. And I probably am slightly jaded and cynical. But I was so looking forward to watching this and I was distinctly underwhelmed.","26 December 2022",5,4,8
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","I'm not going to lie: this movie would have given me nightmares as a kid. Full-blow, fever-inducing nightmares.

Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio is what you would get if you mixed The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993), James and the Giant Peach (1996), and Coraline (2009) with the basic premise of Pinocchio's fairy tale. James and the Giant Peach did a number on me as a little boy, just like this movie would probably have.

It's a dark, surprising take on Pinnochio's story, and I loved it. I think the original story takes place in the 1800s, while this version takes place during the 2nd World War. Did you ever think you would see war, bombs, fascism, Mussolini and biblical angels in the same movie as our dear little wooden puppet? I sure didn't, but I LOVED IT.

I'll give this movie a second watch, maybe even a third.","12 December 2022",10,1,1
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","Set in Italy during the rise of fascism, Geppetto (David Bradley) is an alcoholic woodcarver who still grieves over the death of his son Carlo (Gregory Mann) who died in a bombing during the Great War. In a drunken rage, Geppetto chops down the pine that marks Carlo's grave, unaware of Sebastian J. Cricket (Ewan McGregor) is currently residing in said pine and crafts a wooden puppet with the intention of bringing back Carlo. Taking pity on Geppetto, an ancient Wood Sprite (Wilda Swinton) visits Geppetto's home and bestows the gift of life to the puppet, named Pinocchio (Gregory Mann) as he's made of Pine, and assigns Sebastian to guide Pinocchio. Geppetto is taken aback by Pinocchio not only because of his status as a living puppet and his calling Geppetto ""papa"", but also of the puppet's insatiable curiosity which coupled with his flagrant disobedience leads to misadventures.

Pinocchio has been a long time passion project for director Guillermo del Toro who although initially announcing the project in 2008, del Toro had wanted to make his own version of the story since he was a teenager intending to hold the tone closer to the darker tone of the original story by Carlo Collodi. Del Toro co-directs the film alongside Mark Gustafson, a veteran animator who has had extensive experience in stop-motion having served under the legendary Will Vinton on several of his projects, and del Toro also writes alongside Patrick McHale who wrote the critically acclaimed Over the Garden Wall. Despite its relatively inexpensive budget of $35 million (in comparison to other larger films) del Toro and co. Often found themselves in difficulty in acquiring the resources for the film leading to the film falling into development hell until it was acquired by Netflix in 2017. Now appearing on Netflix's streaming service after following on several other Pinocchio movies (including two this year one of which was a big budget Disney production), del Toro's Pinocchio undeniably stands as apart from the crowded field with a unique take on the story that embraces the darkness of Collodi's original source work, while forging ahead on its own terms.

To start off, the animation and visuals on display in Pinocchio are gorgeous. When I heard this film cost $35 million while the Disney version from earlier this year cost $150 million my jaw came pretty close to hitting the floor. Pinocchio is just incredibly beautiful to look at with its realization of the Italian countryside in 1930s fascist Italy a fully realized vision that transports you to that place and time. The character models aim to capture the stylistic choices of the original illustrations with some adjustments made for the transition from 2D drawings to 3D puppets and it does so very well with the character's faces, movements, and designs carrying emotion and grace in every frame. The movie features a more earthly colored color palette in comparison to the 1940 Disney film (or its live-action remake) and thematically and tonally the fit couldn't be better.

In terms of the writing and storytelling, this version of Pinocchio hits all the major beats you remember from the story but while similar events happy they've been recontextualized to make themselves less isolated as individual episodes and smoothed into a running narrative. The movie features Christoph Waltz and Ron Perlman as our primary antagonists, Count Volpe and Podesta respectively, and they're very much analogues for Stromboli and The Coachman from the original story. The way these characters and episodes are incorporated into this depiction of fascist Italy is pretty seamless all things considered with Pinocchio's stage show becoming more like a propaganda piece and the Podesta's elite youth military training center starting off with the naive young boy's fantasy of what war is only for the dark reality to come forth. David Bradley is great as Geppetto who is a much darker and hardened take on this character is than we've seen before with the film actually following through on what the Tom Hanks version of the character only briefly flirted with in the live-action film. Bradley's performance is fantastic and you feel the rage, frustration, and despair in his voice from the opening scenes where his son is lost to his interactions with the troublesome Pinocchio later. Ewan McGregor is also very good as the overly abused Sebastian J. Cricket and much like the Collodi story this poor cricket is abused by everything but the kitchen sink (and even that's probably in their somewhere). We also have Tilda Swinton in a dual role as the Wood Sprite who grants Pinocchio life and the Wood Sprite's sister Death with both positioned as ethereal and ancient beings who embody two sides of the same coin.

Last but certainly not least in Gregory Mann who plays both Pinocchio and Carlo and he does both incredibly well despite this being his first lead role. The contrast between the quiet and good natured kindness of Carlo versus the energetic, selfish, and often destructive actions of Pinocchio is really well done and the movie does a good job of capturing Pinocchio's character from the book in comparison to the wide-eyed naive innocent of the 1940 film. Despite Pinocchio being absolutely out of control in the opening act of the story, you can still see a good heart underneath the rougher edges. There's a satisfying arc with this character and it follows through on an ending that is equal parts happy and tragic and I'm sure will leave very few dry eyed.

What more can I say about Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio that isn't already on display? This is a true labor of love as it survived a 14 year development hell cycle and has now finally come out and done what the Disney version couldn't despite possessing nearly 5 times del Toro's budget. If you watch this movie you will not regret it.","10 December 2022",10,0,0
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","It's good, even if I wouldn't say it's anything better or worse than its Disney animated counterpart - at least it is a marked improvement on that aforementioned company's remake, mind.

The big win of 'Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio' is the stop-motion animation, which is extremely nice indeed. As for everything else? Nothing leaps out of my mind if I'm honest, even within 30mins of watching it. I personally found the design of the titular character to be 'just' OK, same goes for Sebastian J. Cricket & Co.

I did like the casting of Ewan McGregor and David Bradley, particularly the latter. Christoph Waltz, meanwhile, is alright in his role. The more serious vibe of the film is a positive, though I don't think it comes across as deep as it intended (e.g. That last line from Cricket isn't, in my opinion, as effective as the film seems to think it is). As for the music: fine but forgettable, for me.

Again, it's passable. I just unfortunately didn't overly care as much as I wanted to for this story and its characters. The 1940 film did it slightly better, fwiw.","2 January 2023",7,0,1
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","The other Pinocchio project (along w/Robert Zemeckis' misguided Disney+ entry) currently streaming on Netflix. Following the simple through-line of Collodi's original, Del Toro wholeheartedly lends his stamp to the classic fable by grounding it in the all too real world (the rise of the fascists in Italy during the 30's) as Gepetto builds his son from a tree which looms over the grave of his diseased son (who perished during a bombing one fateful night). Once the blue fairy gives life to the little wooden boy, Gepetto (voiced by David Bradley who worked w/Del Toro on FX's The Strain) is a little thrown back (he was built under alcohol'd duress) as his new charge is more than a handful & following the original story's beats, Pinocchio falls in w/a carnival exploited by its owner, voiced by Oscar winner Christoph Waltz, follows Candlewick, Finn Wolfhard, to a fascist youth camp which his dad, Del Toro regular Ron Perlman, runs & has to save Bradley & his conscience the cricket, Ewan McGregor, from the belly of a whale. Sprinkled w/easy going songs (some of which McGregor starts but never finishes due to humorously being cut off) & fashioned in wonderful stop motion animation (very reminiscent of Laika studios output), this is of a piece w/Del Toro's oeuvre, especially The Devil's Backbone, which handles the familiarity of the narrative the way it should be, giving the audience, in this case, much food for thought while being entertained & wondered at the same time. Other voice actors include Oscar winners Cate Blanchett & Tilda Swinton w/Tim Blake Nelson, Burn Gorman, John Turturro & Gregory Mann who voices the wooden miracle.","28 December 2022",10,0,0
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","I'm going to go ahead and say this right now... This man is not capable of directing bad movies. All the movies i've seen from him has just been so damn amazing, I mean why is this guy being slept on? (Compared to other directors I mean. In general, he is very well own). The Devil's Backbone, Pan's Labyrinth, now this. (Of course his other dark-themed movies too).

I came into this movie thinking it would be the run-of-the-mill Pinocchio Disney type schtick but Guillermo really did a great job with the sort of dark twist he put in the film. It really gave it a different feel from all the other pass Pinocchio adaptions over the times. I also like the little dark and not so dark humor there was here and there. I'm very much so looking forward to this brilliant man's next project.","10 December 2022",9,1,2
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","Doesn't matter if you've seen the original Pinocchio film by Disney (1940), the recent remake (2022), or any other version of it, doesn't matter if you know the original story by Carlo Collodi by heart or have never even heard the word Pinocchio, this film is a piece of art in its own right and deserves a watch from anyone at any age.

Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio simply kills it. His take on this classic story is brilliantly refreshing, sharply written and wonderfully self aware. It leaves you laughing and crying, sometimes simultaneously. The animation, direction and voice acting is superb - but the music and Pinocchio singing (along with his entire character) is truly something else. I'm utterly impressed by this animation and this is me watching it AFTER seeing the 8.0 imdb rating so I already had high expectations going in.

Every so often, you come across something that truly feels like a gem, like you're so lucky to witness something or be in their presence. This film, to me, feels exactly like that.","11 December 2022",10,1,1
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","I read the title and I thought ""here we go, another Pinocchio"". But quoting Guglielmo Del Toro himself ""this film is the retelling of a story you think you do know.. but you don't know"".

Some detachments from the original story are quite interesting.

I found Pinocchio a different character, more inquisitive, struggling to understand what is to be human, what is right and wrong, what is socially acceptable. And I liked the fact that Pinocchio remained a puppet throughout the film and did not turn in a human boy, as to say ""you don't have to change in order to be accepted"".

Geppetto is not quite as pleasant as in his typical representations; he drinks a lot, he gets angry and does not understand Pinocchio, until the Cricket reminds him that the wooden boy loves him and his trying to be appreciated.

The antagonist villain is not the huge Mangiafuoco with his big beard, but rather a more sophisticated and even good-mannered Mister Volpe.

References to the fascist-era events, together with the battle against the Dog Fish, provided material for more action, avoiding the movie to abound with predictable sentimental moments.

The animation is superb.

The Stop-Motion techniques allow to put the right emphasis on the characters and to fit them into lovely sets, especially those who are evocative of beautiful Italian towns.

Also Live Action Videos are used, which implied the animators turning off with a little video of themselves doing the action.

Overall, I enjoyed watching Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio, the story and also some peculiar aspects of animation he wanted the audience to appreciate, summarized as follows: ""If the character is thinking, You wanna see the eyes inputting the information"". ""If you animate the ordinary you will achieve something extraordinary"".","10 December 2022",9,1,1
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","It was a dark, 9:00pm, December, and i sat intently with the kids during the last 10 minutes as my heart almost gave in. By the Gods, WHAT a movie. I think I speak for all of us when I say, ""BALISIMO, Guillermo Del Toro DOES IT AGAIN."" First with pans labyrinth (2006), then Shape of Water (2017) and even the Greatest Showman (2017), he managed to sneak into our hearts for the Final Time. Balismo Amore Mio! I now question my mortality, loves 😂 To be Immortal, it removes our humanity. But Memories my dear are ever lasting, and that is where we are human. Loved the Anti-War messages, I'm not fond of that in all honesty. War is very scary and it scared me. I cannot recommend Enough, but do not let 4 or 2 year olds watch because they just won't get it, okay? GUILLERMO!

"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","This is my personal opinion of this film and you may feel similar to how I feel about it.

Don't let the creepy animation stop you from watching this.

Every voice actor I felt did an amazing job.

The film has some musical scenes throughout it, but none that made me feel bored or that it was incredibly cliché.

Personally I'm not a massive fan of musicals, but the musical scenes in this film felt charming and entertaining.

The singing was beautiful.

Overall it is a well written story and there was never a dull moment and I found many parts hilarious.

There aren't many movies that I can sit down and be drawn in from start to finish.

This truly is a special, well made film which is an instant classic already to me and I'll most probably watch it multiple times throughout my life and with others who enjoy it too.","12 December 2022",10,1,1
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","It is unclear why a film set in fascist Italy, a stop motion that doesn't require real actors, should be in English. There is also a very weird conflation of the two languages, Italian and English, here and there, which is unclear what it is for. The setting during the ventennio fascista had a lot of potential, but then it didn't lead to anything at all. A pointless adaptation that does not add anything to the long list of already existing Pinocchio adaptations, though it is particularly annoying due to the choice of language and the missed potential. The reinterpretation of characters with the merging of two into one in the case of La Volpe is also an inexplicable choice that, again, doesn't add anything.","11 December 2022",1,13,75
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","As a fan of the Disney classic but with little knowledge of the source material, I thought this movie was unnecessary. How mistaken I was!

Del Toro gives us the best version of Pinocchio, the most emotional, the most meaningful (and it was difficult because the classic is already so much), the darkest, the heaviest thematically, and the best balanced. The script works perfectly, with the feet on the ground and never forgetting the origins of the character. This is a markedly more Italian film. Markedly more incisive and critical about war and fascism, with huge metaphors and great lessons. It's also a film with a brilliant father-son relationship, never forgetting the friends and the importance of having good people around you.

The score is beautiful and super catchy and there is a song (Ciao Papa) that moved me so much that I had to go back and repeat the whole sequence. Not being the biggest fan of stop-motion (although recognize the big effort to put it into practice), I never thought I would like the way the technique is used here so much. All the characters have their own life, identity, and personality. I loved everything that is done with them and everything that these characters represent.

The first minutes immediately start to break your heart and the film never stops touching your soul until its impactful ending. One of my favorite Del Toro'a movies.","11 December 2022",9,0,0
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","The best version of this story is by far the Italian version with Italian actors

Pinocchio acts how a doll would act if one came a live, lengthy, weird, awkward
It makes sense
And I appreciate the back story of Geppetto losing his son
There's definitely some depth in this story compared to other versions

Once again Hollywood screws over the Italians
Thanks Guillermo for all the Italians depicting Italians in your movie.

Wait
There's nothing but people who are not Italian
Whatta joke
Italian language being spoken by the whitest actors ever ? Complete garbage
Casting alone drops the score a few points to me

"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","Just wonderful. Hit me in the feels out of nowhere. Brilliant voice acting and wonderful animation that'll take you through a whole gamut of emotions. A brilliant reimagining of the original Pinocchio story with a lot of heart injected in. Some beautiful moments, some dark ones. A film older children and adults can share. Some big emotions for really young ones though.

I'm so glad that films like this are still being made. The collaboration between the Jim Henson company and Guillermo del toro had me glued to the screen from the first moments. It felt like some of the brilliant movies made for children and young adults in the 80s and 90s.

Songs aren't that memorable but for me this isn't a big deal. I thought they mostly added and never felt they should have been left out. Bearing in mind the target audience here, the songs and humour were well enjoyed in our family.

A film about imperfection, naivety, the darkness of the world, love, and friendship.","19 December 2022",8,1,1
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","In the year 2022 there were 3 Pinocchio movies, and Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio (2022) was the best one out of the three. I like the idea of Guillermo del Toro doing Pinocchio, especially when it is done in great stop-motion to make it more interesting.

The voice acting from Ewan McGregor, David Bradley, Gregory Mann, and the rest of the cast were fantastic as these characters. I especially liked Gregory Mann as Pinocchio, I liked how naïve and innocent he was and loved how they animated him with details that that looks real.

The other characters like David Bradley as Geppetto are nicely animated and they have distinct personalities. The stop-motion animation is amazing and looks pretty, with beautiful looking locations and scenery that I loved to look at.

The movie focuses on the darker moments of the Pinocchio story, which is cool to see in animation like this. There are songs, and they are nice to listen to, but they start and end quickly, and this movie has a great musical score to it that is also nice to listen to.

There are scenes, especially the ending, that will make you cry for how beautifully executed they are. Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio (2022) was a fantastic adaptation of the Pinocchio story, and I did love Guillermo del Toro's direction with the movie which is why I highly recommend you watch this.","2 January 2023",8,0,0
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","This was great re imagining of the Pinocchio stories, incorporating much from the original text whilst updating the story to 1930's Germany as the Nazi movement started to emerge.

The voice over work is tremendous, particularly that of the actors playing Pinocchio and Giuseppe. Ewan McGregor is just Ewan McGregor unfortunately. I didn't get a sense of character (Cricket) whatsoever.

There are many great visuals and some funny moments but unfortunately the songs are out of place. Not only are they just plain bad, they jar as the film is dark and more likely to appeal to an older audience but the songs are juvenile and aimed at a much younger audience. That said, I did like the gag of Cricket (Ewan) several times trying to start a song but getting cut off. He finally gets his moment in the credits. All told, definitely worth a watch.","11 December 2022",7,1,2

Also the great photography, the way the movie was made it and every single scene makes you wish to be inside of it. It explain why things happen with real characters and human sensations that makes you be into the movie trying to participate in one way or another helping the main characters to solve the problems they are involve because lies and honesty, better to watch the movie with a box of Kleenex.","11 December 2022",9,1,1
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","I loved the Pinocchio character in this version. I wish they had kept the the original story more, but it was good in its own right. As some have already said, it is not so much for children. The cricket was boring and did not have much of a personality.

Really for me it was Pinocchio that made this worth watching. Cute, likable and a bit funny. Unfortunately to me he was the only character with any redeemable qualities. Even the villains weren't memorable (compared to for example Stromboli in the original Pinocchio and Honest John).

I could have done without the political undertone but also it didn't ruin it, you can kind of choose to ignore it.","13 December 2022",7,1,2
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","The amount of work that went into this animation is amazing. The directing, voice acting, and especially that of the stop animation teams is incredible.

However, there is a somewhat morbid and pervasive death theme throughout the movie that younger children may find very disturbing... and makes me wonder what was behind Del Toro's depiction of the story. Is it because he (like many of us) is getting older and such things are on his mind? It seems like such a theme has little purpose in the story, as it is all presented in a fantasy-setting with little in the way of actual foundation or point.

Other than that, this was far beyond what I expected. I saw this on Netflix, which also presents a 35 minute special on how the film was made; that special is a must-watch. I wondered all the way through the film if this was actual stop animation or computerized graphics to resemble stop animation. While there are certainly special effects used (green screens, etc)... it's actual stop animation that was 15 YEARS in the making. That in itself is astounding.","26 December 2022",8,0,0
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","This film is not for little kids. When I went to see it with a developmentally-impaired adult, I was appalled and bored at the same time(the film lacks substance for adults as well). Several children left the theatre with their parents about halfway through the film.

The visuals are dark and creepy. First there is the skeletal title character, a violent alcoholic Gepetto, his son who gets killed by an explosive devices, a grotesque good fairy and as an added bonus, Mussolini! I have to wonder what the people praising this movie are smoking.

I'm not sure for whom this film was aimed at, except for people who are fans of the director. I liked Nightmare Alley (though the original was better) but this was a bridge too far.","7 December 2022",2,52,231
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","As a lover of Guillermo del Toro, and all things dark, I was really looking forward to his adaptation of one of my favorite fables; however, I was a bit let down. The story of Pinocchio, as most old children's fables are, is already quite dark and depressing, so I was expecting even more here. While I did love some of the added creep factor, It didn't do enough to make up for the elements that were lacking. I enjoyed the backstory (although there were a few holes), the Tim Burton-esque stop motion, and the voice actors. I hated the songs, Pinocchio was annoying, and the story really dragged throughout most of the movie.","10 January 2023",6,2,3

I've seen the original Pinocchio a couple of times, especially when I was a kid. Right now I'm 20 and it's been forever since the last time I saw Disney's Pinocchio, so I was just pretty much blank of expectations or how the plot was gonna be.

The movie started, and it started off way too deep, and it got me in first 5 minutes. The story is so raw, real, with an important message and the way Guillermo delivers that message is.

The final burst me into tears, it's been forever since I've cried in a movie; this one broke the hell out of me.

Even though Guillermo del Toro would be behind it, I still wasn't completely sold, even though I love him as a filmmaker. Well, Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio is now streaming on Netflix, and not only was I surprised to love it, but I think it's my favourite adaptation yet.

Just like most versions of this story, the film starts off with Geppetto (voiced very nicely by David Bradley) after he has lost his son. Fed up with being sad, he chops down a tree next to his son's grave and begins to use that wood to carve a young boy. Brought to life by another lifeform, Geppetto can now try and recreate memories he had with his son. Pinocchio, however, having a mind of his own, decides to make his own decisions, getting himself lost and in a place, he shouldn't be. From guns to straight-up war sequences, this version of Pinocchio is unlike any other.

For being a film that's rated PG, this is much more for mature audiences. I can't see many children getting attached to this version, over something like the original Disney animated film. With that said though, I think the nuances in the detail, especially in the incredible stop-motion work, deserve all the awards. The more mature storyline, alongside expert craftsmanship, when it comes to the set design, I was blown away by every aspect of this movie. The dedication to getting this made is on full display from start to finish.

Overall, Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio isn't just my favourite adaption of this character, but simply one of my favourite films of 2022 in general. The story sucked me in more than I've ever been towards this story and by the end, I was moved by how they handled certain moments. Del Toro's attention to detail and his masterful direction are wonderous here, as always and every frame just felt like it was leaping off the screen. The voice talents are all very enjoyable and more than anything, there are some extremely well-crafted lines of dialogue that nearly had me in tears. Everything that went into this film was done with care and immense effort/talent. I can't wait to watch this one again. I'm all for any nominations this film receives.","14 December 2022",10,0,0
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","The characters are great - Pinocchio is heartwarming and full of energy, childhood curiosity and innocent mischief, which also makes him quite annoying at times, Geppetto shows real grief and patience only a parent can have for their children and Cricket is very effective as both the long suffering narrator and as comic relief. The stop motion animation is superb, the voice acting is good and the songs are entertaining, if a bit on the short side. The plot is two stories mixed together, which does drag a bit in the middle and the second story feels rushed and underdeveloped. The ending is a bit too silly but overall, I thoroughly enjoyed it.","27 December 2022",8,0,0
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","GDT's Pinocchio, while appearing drenched in themes of fascism in Italy and mythology, turns out being a wonderful and whimsical retelling that's riddled with the powers of human spirit and cosy beliefs of love and affection. Starring Ewan McGregor, Gregory Mann and many more, the film is mainly spearheaded from within the vast mind of Guillermo del Toro - him being writer, producer and director - and that aspect is in which a majority of the film's charm originates from. Ever since his work with Wesley Snipes in Blade II (2002) all the way to his work just last year with Inc Nightmare Alley (2021), it is clear now in his career he is particularly meticulous surrounding the way in which his film's sound, production, soundtrack, cinematography and more is used, and is it no clearer in his filmography than within his adaptation of the classic story of Pinocchio. Not only is the film soaked with rich, golden colours but is additionally shot in the stop-motion animation format giving it a very warm and stylistic nature that will leave you bathing in the atmosphere for hours upon hours more. If you have Netflix or any other service to view this on, then I recommend you to watch this film as soon as possible as it is one you will not forget and is deserving of the rating I have given it.","11 December 2022",8,1,1
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","I'm a reeeeeal movie! *Pinocchio classic voice* Welcome back Streamers. This week Netflix released Academy Award-winning filmmaker Guillermo del Toro's reinvention of Carlo Collodi's classic tale Pinocchio. As you know, the tale goes by a wooden puppet is magically brought to life in order to mend the heart of a grieving woodcarver named Geppetto. Del Toro's and Mark Gustafson stop-motion musical follows the mischievous and disobedient adventures of Pinocchio in his pursuit of a place in the world. Well let's get to it.

This is one of those simple reviews. Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio is beautiful, heartbreaking, and fun movie. So much so that it actually makes no sense why the movie wasn't exclusively in the theaters. I mean this isn't really a December/Christmas movie but it's definitely one of those movies that just needs to sneak in before Award Season ends for the year. So what to say about Pinocchio. The stop animation is top notch, creative, and realistic at the same time. I mean just the typical for del Toro. This new version of Pinocchio brings the old story . With the storytelling and the voiceover work the movie gives the movie life. The innonnce and naivete of Pinocchio, the desperation and hope of Gepeto, the callous and unforgiving of Podesta and conveiving and cunning of Count Volpe just shoot of the screen. It's easy to say that with the voice work of a great cast of the likes of Christoph Waltz, Ron Perlman, David Bradley, and Gregory Mann in reverse order. Just to name a few because Ewan McGregor's Cricket just sounded a bit too like himself to be believe able. ANy way, you need those type of performances when this is a long told story like Pinocchio. The imaginative artisty along with the voice work make this feature its own.

Ultimately, Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio is a must-see movie. The animation is inventive and beautiful. While the Pinocchio story is basically the same, this movie zones in on the emotional connection between father and son and a desire to be a better human being. Make sure to have a big box of popcorn and a few tissues when you watch this on Netflix.","16 December 2022",8,1,4
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","This film is a great twist on the classic story of Pinocchio.

This is what happens when you get a true story teller involved in creating a movie, Vs Disney's own live action factory processed output.

A great line up of voice acting, some amazing animation and something to actually say about life and death.

Disney should really take notes if they are going to insist on constantly revisiting their old classics, it is not enough to just take the cartoon and carbon convert it to live action.

Those who love the original Disney cartoon may not jump aboard this, but I would hope they will take it over the misguided live action attempt.","11 December 2022",8,1,1
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","Guillermo Del Toro's Pinocchio is no Disney fairy tale. It's a dark and dangerous world - the genesis of Pinocchio is a WW1 bombing mission, and Pinocchio is created while Italy is ruled by fascism under Mussolini. In that cruel world, Pinocchio is only seen for what he could be - either as a fighter willing to die for Italy, or as an oddity people would pay to see good money to be entertained by.

Pinocchio a tale of bitter joy, brought alive with lovingly crafted stop-motion animation. There might be enough delightful whimsy for a younger audience, with some decent musical numbers and fun characters. However I think adults will respond best to the heavy subject matter, especially the conversations between Pinocchio and Death on the nature of mortality. What stands out the most in the film is the relationship between father and son, of what familial love is, of the burden of living up to expectation, and most importantly of having compassion. It's sentimental without being cliché.","10 January 2023",8,1,1
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","Unlike any version of Pinocchio that I have seen and the best, with my apologies to Disney, that I've ever seen. The craftsmanship of this is extraordinary to put it mildly. It is funny. It is sad. It is riveting. It is touching and it is among the finest things Guillermo del Toro has ever made and eons of an improvement over his last, his dreadfully artificial adaptation of Nightmare Alley, so it's good to see him back in form, though this clearly had many collaborators. This is also somewhat of a musical and if I have a major complaint, this would be it. The score is good, but the songs themselves are somewhat mediocre. I liked the very last tune the best. I've no idea who Gregory Mann is, but he does a wonderful job voicing Pinocchio as does Ewan McGregor as Cricket who we hear the most. This is a film than many children will greatly enjoy, though perhaps not the very young as parts are a bit dark, sad and harsh, but this will be greatly enjoyed by adults as well. A job mighty well done that will most likely be an Oscar winner.","18 January 2023",9,0,0
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","This is a beautiful and well done movie, the stop motion animation is amazing. Lovely sets and fantastic puppets. Definitely worth watching, just don't expect the typical Disney rated G version of the story. Probably not for younger viewers but enjoyable adaptation for most everyone else. The puppets are incredible and the attention to detail really shows the amount of time put into this film. Be sure to watch the supplemental clip after the film for insight into how it was made and some of the more nuanced aspects of the characters and vision behind the film. I especially enjoyed seeing how the story, sets and puppets came to life.","13 December 2022",9,1,2
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","Truly a work of art. Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio is the best version of Pinocchio a person could ever ask for!

Amazing visuals, meaningful dialogues, and eye catching views. You will smile, laugh, and cry during the movie. One of my best experiences was watching this masterpiece with my family. Brilliant story and wonderful soundtracks.

I would recommend this movie to anyone who cares to watch an actual good movie. Good movies are rare nowadays, so don't miss the chance to experience this masterpiece!

It doesn't matter how old you are, who you are, and where you are, I assure you you will enjoy this movie just as I, and many others did.","16 December 2022",10,3,6
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","Masterpiece. That is all Im going to say.

The music, the characters, the story; everything is so well thought. They spent 15 years doing this movie!!! And everything was hand made. This is extraordinary. This guy deserves an Oscar for this movie.

I started to cry since minute one until the movie ended. It is a story about life and how hard relationships with our parents can be. Not the typical story of Pinocchio. This one is real. The magic of the movie is that there is little magic, everything feels real as if I could be living the same experience as pinnochio. Guillermo did it again , amazing director.","10 December 2022",10,1,1
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","This movie has a very good new story to tell about Pinocchio. Guillermo del Toro did a solid job working on the animation and working on his best work of the story. And also a beautiful clay animation vibes with Tim Burton's beautiful work of art.

Sure it has a different story to it, but at least it's way better than the other remake live action Pinocchio. The new live action remake of Disney's Pinocchio was so bad and they changed a different story to the end and they also messed up some good scenes and they also showed new scenes that we haven't seen was so bad and ridiculously weird.

But for Guillermo del Toro's best work of art and his amazing talent, and charming movie ever made... I say this brings the best Pinocchio story ever told.","10 December 2022",9,0,0
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","I love Disney's Pinocchio, so I chose the Netflix original movie ""Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio"" as my first movie to watch in 2023. This movie has a slightly darker feel than the original Disney movie. It is a content that incorporates old wars and human dramas. To be honest, I didn't really like the animation and art of the characters very much. Because it's a little dark overall. This is a movie I recommend for adults who want to watch it alone on a Sunday afternoon. For family fun, I recommend Disney's original movie Pinocchio. Finally, my favorite line is those two.

1) ""Well, in this world, you get what you give.""
2) ""Every moment shared with them may be the very last.""","5 January 2023",6,0,1
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","As I understand it, the original story of 'The Adventures of Pinocchio' essentially boils down to a morality tale deriding the shallow pursuits of selfish and naive hedonism in favour of hard work, study, honesty and listening to one's elders.

Would Del Toro dare to try and encapsulate such an unfashionable message for today's viewers? Would he dare to challenge the moral hegemony of Hollywood?

The short answer is no.

Del Toro's version opts for 'lessons' like: fascism is bad and shouldn't be blindly followed (really? I never would have guessed); children are naturally good in nature and therefore shouldn't really listen to their parents - who are mostly corrupt, evil, selfish, greedy or self-obsessed anyway; breaking things is just a part of a child's exuberant nature and should be celebrated...and so on.

Although Pinocchio dies several times, he never seems to truly suffer in this version. Death isn't real to him, therefore there is no chance for ultimate sacrifice (or is there?). Notably, the Christ features here as a dusty wooden relic, constructed by man, standing in the shadows of a bombed out church.

Rather than have to struggle to gain wisdom and see the error of his childish ways - Pinocchio's inate 'innocence' and 'goodness' is what others have to learn to appreciate.

Where the Disney version felt Pinocchio required a conscience to become human, Del Toro's seems to imply that Pinocchio, being essentially nature imbued with spirit (Gaia, anyone?) is pretty much perfect already and it's humans, especially the adult variety, who are the problems.

Here, Pinocchio quickly decides education is not for him, it's 'too hard', but rather than suffer directly for such a choice it simply sparks a new adventure. His character arc has been gutted and the movie feels empty, meandering and pointless without it.

Meanwhile his 'father' Gepetto (representing callous and oppressive patriarchy, no doubt) fights over his 'ownership' of the puppet son/sun with Count Volpe. Volpe, a hideous looking creation, employs a slave monkey (Del Toro's symbolism, not mine ) and is obsessed with money and exploitation. It's not subtle.

Del Toro decides to move the original tale forward in time, to Mussolini's Fascist dictatorship. In doing so, he renders all the adult characters intrinisically corrupt/complicit in evil, including the church priest (who enthusiastically performs a nazi salute). What is required is the innately good activism of children - acting in comradeship - to rise up and overthrow the unjust system.

Although the 'heroes' learn to be less selfish by the end, it feels tacked on and messy rather than a natural evolution of the narrative, as if Del Toro remembered at the end what the tale was supposed to be about. Any moral 'heart' it has feels cannibalised from a tale, and a time, the makers have no respect for.

As for the animation, it's undoubtedly technically classy, though I found the whole look of the thing unattractive (and not in a way that was dark enough to be truly unsettling - which might have been interesting). The songs weren't insufferable, but seemed an afterthought. The choice of voices was mixed - Ewan McGregor sounded all wrong as the cricket, the only other voice that stood out was Christoph Waltz, who was reliably creepy.","2 January 2023",4,3,12
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","Guillermo Del Toro once again shows his amazing talent and creativity bringing with his interpretation of Pinocchio. Great choice to use stop motion and bring this unused medium to his own interpretation of this old story, bringing in unique characters and character designs.

Pacing is really well done, always keeps the story progressing and the viewer engaged. The highpoints of the film are definitely it's unique inclusion of World War II, which is actually used in the plot and not just shoved in to be ""original"", and the wonderful ending that brings a different change of pace to this story.

The only real negative I can name are that it's rating being the only thing holding it back from its maximum potential. Children for sure will be engaged and entertained, and it's understandable that Del Toro stayed in the PG rating in order for it to reach that audience. But the dark themes and unique story leave some viewers wondering what more could have been provided in this wonderful story if only it had a rating of perhaps PG-13.","3 January 2023",9,1,1
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","Guillermo del Toro is a fantastic director, anytime I see his name on a movie I instantly get excited and want to see that movie. So when I found out that he was making a Pinocchio movie for Netflix, I was stoked for the film. Now that I have watched this film, I think it is safe to say that this is a brilliant film. The animation first of all is amazingly well done, every scene is done with such perfection and it feels time consuming to put together. But for the film it works wonderfully, I thought the story was compelling and it had actual moments when I was worried for the main character which is rare for animated films. And it has some creepy characters that are really cool. Overall I highly enjoyed Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio, it could very well be my favorite Pinocchio movie.","28 December 2022",9,0,0
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","After watching this, I'm quite stunned how good it was.

As a child you would get those eerie vibes off a Disney film, some of the characters voices or natures would make you have those scary moments, but also a love for the characters and especially the songs.

This one does it all, the songs are great, sad and endearing.

The animation is so great.

The quirky characters , voicing and nature of the theme it's all so well put together.

I remember watching a long time ago , when it came out, a nightmare before Christmas, and instantly loving it all, the music and characters. This film reminds me of how I felt back then, those same feelings of taking to the film. Brilliant.

So impressed with this film, i absolutely love it.","12 December 2022",10,1,1
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","""Animated movies are for kids"" No, they are not, this movie is not for kids but it still amazing and it'll always be. There are animated movie like Persepolis or Mr. Fox that are excellent but not for kids. Pinocchio it's amazing in every aspect of the story, has some things that the original hasn't but they are actually better! Recommended and it makes think about it at least one night. Historic thing for Guillermo del toro! Again!. This makes the Disney live action terrible, more than it was

Even though is deeper than the original, it's better, it has a lot of details that every movie should have. Always recommended.","15 December 2022",10,2,3
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","The year's second remake of 1940's kids classic ""Pinocchio"" is set in Mussolini's Italy, where a carpenter (voiced by David Bradley) grieving his dead son makes the titular puppet boy (Gregory Mann) who springs to life to head out on adventures / misadventures with cricket 'conscience' (Ewan MacGregor) and the stellar likes of Christoph Waltz, Cate Blanchett, John Turturro, Tilda Swinton, Tim Blake Nelson, Ron Perlman & Burn Gorman (all voices only). Noted director Guillermo del Toro (who also co-wrote it with Patrick McHale) applies a dark style & Tim Burtonesque animation, which IS effective... but surely one ""Pinocchio"" remake was already enough for this year.","15 December 2022",7,0,3
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","It is not often that the director puts his name in the title of a movie and so I was curious to know why the ""stop motion animated ""movie titled "" Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio"" had the director's name in it. It had probably become necessary since Robert Zemeckis's "" Pinocchio "" is another movie released in the same year. As a true movie buff I saw both movies. Interestingly while the latter version with Tom Hanks deals with the story in the traditional manner keeping in mind the sensibilities of children and family audiences, the Guillermo version is made on a different perspective ( a reimagination having dark hues, minus the cuteness and innocence of the Hanks version.) I feel that this is basically a family based children's story and it should remain that way with the lovable characters like the cute boy, simple woodcarver father, Jimmy Cricket, blue fairy etc. In the Guillermo version the cute, cuddly, impish boy is replaced with puppet not so cute, the blue fairy is replaced with a ""blue humanoid being with 8 wings"", Pinocchio gets run over by a truck, goes into afterlife, meets death etc etc.

The movie is predominantly technology driven and the visual effects are outstanding no doubt but I missed the soul and simplicity of the traditional Hanks version. Maybe it is an indication of modern times and a reflection of present thinking that the Guillermo version has already got many awards ( probably an Oscar on the way) and the reviews have a much higher rating in comparison.","23 January 2023",5,0,0
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","Del Toro has created a masterpiece. This movie is dark, beautiful and thematically deep in ways that I have not seen from a movie in recent memory. It contains themes of Grief, trauma, death, an exploration of the human soul, and a surprisingly robust deconstruction of the fascist cult of hero worship if you know where to look for it. This is all packaged in beautiful stop motion animation crafted over the four years that this movie was in development. The movie also goes to several dark places, including death, alcoholism, war, fascism (as previously mentioned) and grief, all of which are treated with gravity and seriousness deserved. It is one of the rare movies that come along only every so many years that make me genuinely believe the world would be a better place were everyone in the world to watch them.","13 December 2022",10,2,3
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","I was not very familiar with the original Pinocchio film and the story, but director Guillermo del Toro took a risk with this stop-animation film and it paid off. The production was a bit reminiscent of Tim Burton with the utilization of dark cinematography and animation, but this one was a league of its own. Again, stories with emotional leverage were deeply loved by audiences, and this one was no different. The story was relevant and the historical background provided a much stronger emotional depth to the entire film. The only problem I had was it failed to ellicit such emotional reaction in me. But the storytelling was marvelous.","27 December 2022",5,0,2
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","The same fantastical story, in much more detail, both in added background history of the characters, and in absolutely incredible stop-motion film-making. The attention to detail is so good I forget I'm watching an animated movie and see the faces of those most recognisable voices: Ewan, Ron, Cate, Tilda & Christoph, to name a few, instead of the brilliant, hand-carved puppets!

Not many modern films touch upon the lives of everyday Italians when Mussolini reigned, and Guillermo Del Toro has captured a whole segment of that society on his telling of this fable. All the characters are there: the circus folk, the whale, the cricket, the school bullies, etc. But, all the characters are a bit skewed, different to how they're remembered. Wasn't the cricket called ""Jimmeny""? Now it's Sebastian J. Cricket! Subtle differences that make it all the more interesting to watch, maybe even again!

A father-son story that makes your knees weak and lips tremble, told through the lens of a master horror director (Blade II, Hellboy, Pan's Labyrinth, The Shape of Water, etc.), and in the hands of master craftspeople bringing those wooden people to life!

A tasteful retelling of a true classic.","29 December 2022",8,0,0
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","I've been a fan of del Toro's storytelling and visual art style for a long time. Still animation has always been my cup of tea, being Tim Burton's Nightmare before Christmas my undeniable favorite for almost 30 years. This is the first time I question in all that time to have a new favorite stop motion creation.

Guillermo's Pinocchio hits deep in many of life's biggest dichotomies. Joy vs sorrow, life vs death, ambition vs ethics, pride vs emphaty and the most complicated one, the ever complex father and son relationship.

This movie gives you a beautiful bone to break apart, chew and digest through the most diligent art form possible. The characters are exquisite, the ambiance is breathtaking and the movement and interactions are so detailed that after 5 minutes you're sucked into this world with no escape for the next 2 hours of craftsmanship.

Maybe the music score didn't bedazzle me on my first watch, but I got a ring on my ear that it may change by the third time I watch this gorgeous masterpiece. So now I'm of to it.

Cheers.","10 December 2022",10,1,1
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","This was by far and amazingly well done version of this movie that I have grown up knowing but never seen. I avoided the disney original as it never interested me. I certainly was not going to give disney the satisfaction of watching their newest live action. So, despite my aversion to movie/musicals I have it a go.

I loved it!! From the very beginning it was funny, heartfelt and engaging. The stop action, scenery, colors. Everything. Just fantastic. Words do not give it Justice. Just watch it.

I will agree with Some that I do find it odd some speak in British English and other Italian. Like are we in Italy, then use Italian accents.

This is my first Guirellmo Del Toro and I am very pleased.","11 December 2022",10,2,3
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","This film made me more critical of my own animations. Animation should be a medium to show something amazing, unlike Disney's remake.

Ciao Papa is my father's favourite song, I think it sits closer to those who have lost someone, it has so much emotion and a sense of longing.

Stop motion shouldn't be dying, the movie had so much detail in the handcrafted sets. I wish companies would prefer quality over quantity, stop motion takes so long and it should be recognized as quality work.

The opening and entire beginning is so perfect. My favorite scene was when Pinnochio acted like a zombie, with broken joints and such. 🤣","22 December 2022",10,1,1
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","I should start by saying, I hate Pinocchio. Every other version has always just felt sort of creepy and boring to me. But in Guillermo del Toro's hands it is transformed into the absolute perfect fairytale. This is one of the best pieces of animation I've ever seen in my life (I'm 36 and a lover of animation). It's so full of life and soul. It is thought provoking, funny, entertaining. The only thing I'd change is wishing this had come out when I was a kid so I could see it through the lens of a child. It's a masterpiece. I would also recommend watching Pinocchio handcarved cinema, after the movie. It's a little behind the scenes look into how it was created. It somehow makes the movie feel all the more special bc you can see all the love that went into its creation.","11 December 2022",10,1,2
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","My wife and I had the chance to watch this film in theatre. It is spectacular to watch with astonishing visual effects, and excellent voice acting. The story itself is deeply moving and thought provoking as well. Essentially this is a study in what it means to be human.

Very minor quibbles but it should be noted that this is not a children's story, at least not for young children. And the music, while fitting and well placed, is not what some might expect. Again, it wasn't made for kids. At least you won't have to listen to your kids sing the songs endlessly.

That said every adult should watch this movie. It will stay with you for a very, very long time.","21 January 2023",9,1,1
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","Yes, in 2022 there were 3 ""Pinocchio"" movies released, and this one is easily the best one. Granted that is a very low bar to clear. But beyond that, this is a really, really good film.

The first impression this film makes is with its animation, and it is spectacular. It is clear that a lot of hard work went into the presentation of this film. Stop motion has come a long way from the days of Rakin Bass. The movement is fluid and the details are intricate, it is something to behold. I would say that this is the most beautiful stop motion animation movie ever, rivaled only by Liaka Studios.

The voice acting and music is also top notch, every actor putting in a stellar performance. The movie is a musical and all the songs are pretty good. The first song, ""My Son"" is the best of the bunch.

The story takes a lot of clever twists from the original tale. Putting Pinocchio, the string less puppet, in the backdrop of fascist Italy leads to great commentary. Another twist I enjoyed was that the creation of Pinocchio was more of a Frankenstein situation. When Geppetto sees Pinocchio, he is first repulsed at what he had created.

The character of Pinocchio is very well done. With his youthful excitement but also naivety. He maintains his optimism without becoming oblivious to reality.

There are only a few things that didn't work for me. Some plot points towards the third act, some character decisions that didn't add up. Some decisions feel rushed, or unearned. And there are a few plot holes that can be waved away for fairy tale logic.

This very much stands on its own, as its own original telling of the classic fairy tale. But I will compare it to the 1940 classic. With it being like the 2nd animated feature...ever, it will always hold an important place in history, and nothing will take that away from it. I believe the 1940 one has the better moments, stuff like ""Wish upon a Star"" and Pleasure Island. But this film is the more complete package. This film did its best, and that's the very best anyone can do.","29 December 2022",8,0,0
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","Magic exists in each of Guillermo del Toro's beautiful worlds, but there are limits to its power. As one character in his new childrens' film Pinocchio says, ""there are rules, and they must be obeyed"". Decisions have consequences. The characters are in real danger.

Del Toro's Pinocchio is inspired by the Disney classic, and there are few plot surprises. When Sebastian J. Cricket is promised a single wish in the first few minutes of the film, we know what it will eventually be used for. It's the world that del Toro builds that makes the film worth watching.

Pinocchio's world is brimming with del Toro's distinctive fantasy. Beautifully imagined spirits descended from those in Pan's Labyrinth follow the characters. Scenes in the underworld are, as Pinocchio says at one point, comprised of rabbits, games, stars, and lots of blue sand.

The film opens at the foot of a grave, and death and loss haunt the main characters. The setting is Fascist Italy during the second world war. Even with such serious themes, it is not a heavy movie. In Disney style, the characters occasionally break out in song. Young children will probably be oblivious to the way the baddies are not only frustrated, but are doomed to violent ends.

Even if it is beautifully rendered, it is, after all, a childrens' film. The characters are thin, and we know who to root for and who to boo from the start. That keeps Pinnochio from real greatness. Even so, it is pleasant enough to live in such beautiful fantasy for a couple of hours. Worth a watch for del Toro fans.","4 December 2022",7,6,27
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","This movie is an excellent re make of a classic. I loved the original Disney Pinocchio when I was a child and now I am totally delighted with this version.

I do agree with the people saying this is not a children movie, it is not, so it is not fair to rate it as it was because it contains many sensitive topics indeed. As I see it, it is an animation movie for adults and as that is a jewel. In less than two hours the movie managed to retell the story in a very original way and it manage to include so many clues of the political situation in Italy during those times. I just loved how political the movie is. Also, there are many small details that show the genius in the construction of each one of the characters. For example, it fascinated me that the cricket had the picture of Arthur Schopenhauer in his house. On my eyes it was a very melancholic movie, it portraits dead as it is: sad and unavoidable, and both traits are just beautifully displayed with very good dialogues and visuals. In addition, I loved how some of the iconic scenes of the Disney film were kept in this version, just to mention one, the scene of Geppetto looking for Pinocchio at night is portrayed both in the Disney movie and in this version mastering the way of transmit sadness. This movie is just excellent, will watch it at least twice.","11 December 2022",10,1,2

These characters draw you in and make you care and believe in their performances despite being actual puppets. The attention to detail is remarkable along with the beautiful settings the movie visits. The care that went into this film is shown on screen and is a cinematic masterpiece that proves stop motion can be impactful given the right team is assembled. The length was a bit overrun however Inam uncertain of what to remove so it's a moot point. Do yourself a favour and give this a chance, you'll be glad you did.","13 December 2022",10,1,1
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","I thought I'd like this one, but I found it surprisingly hard to watch, and only made it about 1/3rd of the way through before giving up. The stop-motion animation is indeed impressive, and that's worth 4 stars. However, the story is presented in a dreary, depressing, and dark way, which is one reason it's hard to watch. Another, bigger reason it's hard to watch is that the wooden boy's dialog is moronic, sounding like it was actually written by a 5 year-old, and not even an intelligent 5 year-old at that. IMHO, far too many movies aimed at kids treat the audience as if the are brain dead (e.g., most recent Disney animated movies). But, it is particularly inexcusable for this movie, as it's not really a kids movie. I was kind of hoping that somebody would do us all a favor, and toss the wooden boy into the fire.","5 January 2023",4,1,4
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","I came to view the ratings and i am completely shocked to find some are rated so low. This movie was AMAZING to say at the least. They spent 15 years making this movie, each frame HAND DONE step by step. Did y'all even know that?? That is absolutely MOVING and inspiring to me that it brings tears to my eyes! Pinocchio is a little mouthy at times but shoot so am I. The way the beasts are portrayed was beautiful and almost biblical like. I watched it multiple times in the same week it first dropped on Netflix. Thank you for such an amazing film, the hard work truly showed. I will continue to watch this and support those that helped make this movie the masterpiece it is!","22 January 2023",10,1,1
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","Del Toro is absolutely one of my favorite directors and so I will watch anything he puts out . Admittedly this style of animation is not my favorite and honestly if he had not been involved I probably would never have watched jr . I went it thinking I would not enjoy it simply because the style of animation would bother me and therefore I would not like the aesthetic.

The writing was so good that it made the animation worth it . It's dark and heavy and unexpected . It's real and tragic and makes you think . It's quick moving and draws you in and makes you want to read the original and watch the old ones again just to compare . It shows grief in a very real and powerful way . It shows love in a way we can all relate to, love is hard and messy and complicated and can often hurt and requires so much sacrifice .

All of that being true , I won't watch again simply because the aesthetic bothered me enough - but I am so glad I watched it this time and would recommend it to others as well .","15 January 2023",7,0,0
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","I found the movie to be quite emotional, even though I was expecting more!

Imho, the original story of Pinocchio by Carlo Collodi is much better than this version by Del Toro.

I'm Italian and the 'real' story of this little piece of wood and his father Geppetto still breaks my heart. Nothing like this kind of musical/motion picture/wannabe tear-off Christmas movie.

Moreover, I believe that respecting the folklore of a country is not only the basis of good storytelling, but it is also fundamental to reach a good result and to positively impress those who watch the movie.

By the way, Guillermo Del Toro's Pinocchio is still a pleasant watch for both kids and adults. A movie that is not afraid to wisely mix tears with laughter and vice versa.","12 December 2022",4,6,15
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","A grim retelling of a story we know well. Guillermo del Toro delivers a beautiful stop motion retelling of Pinocchio that fits his brand so well. It´s a kids movie but it has so many twisted scenes and ideas to it that it can only be a del Toro movie. It didn't click with me a hundred percent as I see it more as a visual challenge than a good story, but it´s a fun and interesting watch.

After losing his son to world war 2, the carpenter Geppetto makes a boy of wood. A wood spirit brings the wooden boy to life and he most now navigate being alive.

The animation is absolutely incredible. It took me a few minutes in to really see it was stop motion. The animation is so smooth Nealy all the time and the characters are designed in such a way, it might as well had been an animation style in the traditional ways. The production is incredible here and everything from sets, backgrounds and characters look incredible. This is a technical marvel and so well done.

I really love the faded look of this movie. It could have gone for a color popping style and really lean into the kid style but it went for a more laid back color pallet which really helps del Toros style. It looks amazing from start to finish and everything in terms of production is outstanding.

The movie is full of incredible voice acting. Nealy every character is voiced believable and fitting for their character. I loved Ron Perlmans performance, David Bradley, Christoph Waltz. I also was surprised how good Finn Wolfhard was as a voice actor and I hope he keeps it up. My favorite performance was Gregory Mann as Pinocchio. It´s a relatively new actor on the scene and he really delivers here. He hit the childhood innocence of Pinocchio perfectly and is a joy to listen to from start to finish. An outstanding performance from an actor that will go far.

This is a great twisted version of the classic Disney Pinocchio tale, and it works so well. Del Toro can´t help himself fusing in horror in his media, even when it´s a kids movie like this. The movie has this horror tone and felling to it, while not leaning directly into horror. It´s still a kids movie in my opinion but has thoughts small things. Pinocchio moving creepy in the beginning, the underlying war, the spirits, all has this scary felling to it. But the movie hasn't much story to it. It´s a series of events and a fun take on the original tale. I think it tries too hard to tell you what it´s about in the end and the movie doesn't do a great job of moving to the emotional climax. It´s a bid aimless but still a really fun movie.

The musical elements aren't that impressive to me, and I think the movie had been better without. It doesn't add much and only one song doesn't sound like a generic musical song to me ""Ciao papa"".

Pinocchio by Guillermo del Toro is a prediction marvel that looks incredible, and it has his style. It´s a different kind of kids movie in an era of safe kids media that dares to go and show dark things. It´s an enjoyable movie and it entertains throughout but doesn't have much substance to it in terms of story. I still enjoyed it though, and can´t wait to watch it again.","29 December 2022",6,0,0
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","After watching this movie on Netflix here's my spoiler-free review of Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio first as usual I'll talk about my thoughts, my favourite part of it and my overall conclusion/rating! David Bradley plays Geppetto which is completely separate from Tom Hanks's version of the live-action one and Ewan McGregor plays Sebastian J. Cricket a new & original character in this film that shares similarities to Jiminy Cricket from Disney! Other cast members include a new voice for the wooden boy played by Gregory Mann, Finn Wolfhard, Ron Pearlman (who's worked with Guillermo del Toro in his previous movies) Tilda Swinton and Cate Blanchett! My favourite part of watching this was the stop-motion animation cuz I haven't seen that since the Isle of Dogs & Frankenweenie! Overall this film is too scary for young kids but I would recommend this to teenagers and young adults! This movie wasn't great fun or bad fun but good fun that's why I'm giving this a 7/10! Hopefully, older audiences will enjoy it but it's not a kid's movie! ;-)","15 December 2022",7,0,0
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","I am utterly thrilled Disney skipped this adaptation of Pinocchio, cause it was really bad, a waste of my and my kids time. This movie adaptation is nowhere near Disney original Pinocchio. The moral of Pinocchio was non-existent in Guillermo del Toro version of Pinocchio. The storytelling was meh and the art-style is trash. This is never a movie meant for kids, more like sinister fans. The movie disappointed in every way, cause Guillermo del Toro other works like Nightmare Alley or Pans Labyrint is actually good, but this trash right here is nowhere near the quality of those titles mentioned before. Enjoy :(","9 December 2022",1,33,267
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","Del Toro's adaptation of Pinocchio is beautifully made. Flawless. Suspenseful. Action. Adventure. And completely squeezed my heart out of every emotion held within.

The animation is beyond fantastical. Every detail is phenomenally fulfilled in this film.

The film, in my opinion, is not for small children.

Keep a box of kleenex nearby if you are prone to shedding tears. And, perhaps, call a close friend after you watch the film. It is a stark reminder of our mortality.

Aside from the original animated film adaptation of the story, this is the best that I've seen. Bravo!!!!! Bravo!!! BRAVO!!!","10 December 2022",10,0,0
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","While I think this was a better film, I scored it equally to the live action Disney adaptation. It's like Up, Team America and Inglorious Bastards as if they were made as one film by Tim Burton.

It was a dark, interesting take but I can't say I would watch it again. The first half went by quick but the second half was losing me. I think it could've been a tad shorter but I liked the originality here. Lots of powerful symbolism and undertones of messages with bigger meanings. I think the most amazing part about it was that it is stop motion animation with incredible cinematography and a haunting score.","14 December 2022",,0,0
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","It's no news that the story of Pinocchio is one of the most adapted stories in the overall cinema oeuvre, it's a pretty compelling story with darker shades that have captivated many throughout the years, that's why it's with great pleasure to see that one of the greatest of cinema, Guillermo del Toro has chosen to adapt this tale into his darker fairytale style. He's already done this with the brilliant Pan's Labyrinth and that movie about Día de los Muertos that I haven't seen yet. However, with the story of Pinocchio I've only ever seen the Disney version (and my only reference on how this story has been done), and despite all the times that I've seen it as a kid it was one of the Disney movies that scared me the most with its elements of body horror and being swallowed alive by a whale monster- how does Guillermo fare in adapting this tale?

Pinocchio follows the life of Gepetto, a masterful carpenter in an Italian village with the backdrop of the Italian fascist dictatorship looming over him, after the loss of his son his grief is touched or overheard by a forest spirit that decides to give a puppet that Gepetto did, life to accompany him and be his son.

At first glance the story seems to follow the basic story threads and plot of the other Pinocchios however it doesn't, it adds a whole different side to how it is told with a new ending and a different side plot, characters and motive that sheds a whole new light into the story. The most basic element of any Pinocchio story is that of a boy that learns to not lie anymore, however in here Guillermo switches the narrative- rather than a boy learning not to lie it's more about being truthful to oneself and one's own ideals, this is perhaps the most truthful Pinocchio that we've ever got! Don't get me wrong, we do get the whole ""nose grows because of lies""-thingy but it's used extremely sparingly and only as a plot device for something that happens near the end of the movie. This Pinocchio isn't chastised because of his lies, it's more because he represents the freedom that so many despise, especially in fascist Italy which changes the whole element of this narrative. This was a good choice that Guillermo made but perhaps it's gonna throw off some viewers. I also like that he used the backdrop of fascist era Italy for this story it's almost too perfect!

The animation is GORGEOUS, it's made with such care and fluidity- in a cinema landscape where 3D animation is the norm it is a great joy for me to see that directors want to do something in this style- it takes a lot more time but it's worth it! You can see the love that's been given to all of the frames, the character designs, it's truly an artful masterpiece in this manner.

The actors are great as well, although there's a bit of a disparity on who gets to have an Italian accent or not, Pinocchio has a very British accent which is alright but it takes away from some of the immersion of the movie (I know this is nitpicky but I think it is worth mentioning). Overall everyone is super good!

The music is good, it's fun to see some of the musical numbers, I don't think they take over the movie (sometimes even interrupted by the characters in the movie when it is perceived to be ""annoying"") and they serve the movie well.

Despite me loving the movie I think it has a few shortcomings, they don't affect the overall experience but I think they should've been looked into a bit more.

The majority of the movie is about Pinocchio rebelling against his surroundings and instilling friendships in those situations, which is a good thing, but the main problem of this is that the relationship between Pinocchio and Gepetto isn't really earned which makes the impact of that ending scene a bit less emotional (in the context of the movie it is super sad and emotional but it's just not earned to be that way due to how Gepetto and Pinocchio act in the majority of the movie). Gepetto starts his relationship with Pinocchio fearing and almost hating him which makes Pinocchio disappear for the rest of the movie into something else, it would've been way more impactful if perhaps Gepetto could've been a part of these escapades that Pinocchio has? That would've made it even more impactful!

Considering the ending, I won't spoil it here but it adds some really unnecessary continuity to the story which makes it less impactful (again) it also doesn't tie the plot in some of the aspects of one character that is left in the dust (namely the boy named Candlewick).

Another thing that I wish this story would have is perhaps more of Guillermo's signature horror sensibilities, stop motion animation is PERFECT for this type of mashup of genres (see Coraline) and here it does have some unnerving elements but nothing more which is strange considering how amazing Guillermo is at doing this. I honestly think the Disney movie is more scary than this one. I blame this aspect on the marketing and the critics of this film cause they said that this was a bit scary but it isn't really. At least not for me.

All in all this is a great movie, it is awesome to see Guillermo expanding his range to other types of filmmaking and it is always amazing to see stop motion animation- despite some plot choices and some lack of edge I think it still stands as one of the greatest adaptations of Pinocchio. Check it out!","8 January 2023",8,0,0
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","It's World War II, a violent geriatric alcoholic lonely madman, witnesses his unusually young son (whose age no one seems to question), who he left alone in church, get killed by an unexpected bombing run from passing bomber planes. He goes on a destructive rampage which leads to him hacking down a tree and angrily carving a puppet of a small boy, with a head modelled on Castaway's Wilson. A late night deal with an evil wood sprite and a failed author, who also happens to be a cricket, brings the puppet to life. The puppet immediately goes on a malevolent rampage and turns into a horrendously angry young lout. A local fascist and member of the SS comes up with a plan to build an army of wooden super soldiers based on the malevolent young puppet.

"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","This is the best reinterpretation of Pinocchio's story I've ever seen, it has within it a great life lesson, social criticism and above all let's say it doesn't have ""out hair on its tongue"". Guillermo Del Toro is simply a genius in all respects, he told Pinocchio in his own way with a stop-motion technique done too well, the music is 100% immersive. I would like to make a small note about the dubbing which I found superb, truly beautiful. I was very excited, this film grabbed me from start to finish and the duration of two hours didn't make itself felt at all. I won't say anything else otherwise I'll make spoilers but since it's recently been released on Netflix everyone go and see it because in my opinion it's one of the best products of this 2022.","10 December 2022",9,0,0
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","Pinocchio is caught between the inhuman and the human for most of his episodic adventures, which is crucial to his singular mix of charm and menace. That helps explain the durable appeal of Collodi's story, and it also makes del Toro and company's decision to set the tale in Fascist Italy all the more baffling and disappointing. It's evident that the filmmakers wanted to create a different, tougher and putatively more serious Pinocchio than the Disney version that has been lodged in the popular imagination for decades. But the movie's decontextualized and disturbingly ill-considered use of Fascism is reductive and finally grotesque.","10 December 2022",10,0,0

Then we watched the second half on the second night and that was just as sad with so many twists and turns, however I thought that he turned back into the little boy but in this version of Pinocchio that didn't happen.

When I found out it was a real stop motion movie my jaw dropped. This is movie craft I didn't believed existed anymore. I recommend this movie for all ages, young or adult. I will see it many times in the future.

The story has a captivating first act that makes you care and want to follow the main characters. The story has a very rich palette of elements involved. The adaptation of the original Pinocchio books and the Disney version is well balanced and also introduce som new takes of the story.

"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","A pointlessly ""darker"" version of a beloved classic. Definitely not made for young children. This would make a very depressing family movie to sit through for nearly two hours. Is it artful and well-made? Sure. I'm just confused as to whom exactly it is made for. My very mature seven-year-old sat through it and enjoyed it, but was left with a lot of questions. The only reason I allowed us to sit through it is that it was among her Netflix content, which has a 7+ filter (though I need to ban a lot of content even with that filter in place). My friend's much more sensitive seven-year-old would undoubtedly be in tears pretty quickly, even two years from now. So, if not a family film, I don't know what kind of a film this is. I've mixed feelings about del Toro's work, but ultimately, I think he should probably stay away from ""family"" films.","11 December 2022",6,1,3
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","Truly horrified by the glorification of fascism and the violence encouraged between the children. Why are there Nazi solutes through out the movie? Why does a father encourage his son to shoot his friend? Why is the ""magic"" so dark? There is a total lack of morals through out the movie; I was not prepared for it, and felt misled by the preview and MPAA rating. This movie is definitely not for Christians- beyond the above mention things which should be problematic for everyone, this movie also includes pagan gods, obvious drunkenness, and a scene where Pinocchio questions why everyone loves Jesus but hates him when ""he's made of wood too."" Pinocchio is referring to a crucifix in this moment, but we can all infer the message intended. I had to have a serious talk with my children about how I failed to protect their hearts and minds when I took them to see this. Had this movie been represented accurately by the preview and rating I wouldn't have taken my children to see it- I wish I had researched more.","13 December 2022",3,9,36
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","This story was different and I did not expect it to be changed in the time period. This beautiful piece of art raised the bar for this type of stop action / claymation work. Only the BOX TROLL movie work can compare. Just imagine if the older claymation greats that did the old King Kong movies of old could see work their work pioneered. This was a treat with all the great CGI Movies it was very nice to see this stopmotion. I hope to see more of this style movie gain favor. Beautiful stop action work. The colors are so dramatic. Voice over and music was fabulous. Always fantastic direction, film work from Mr. Del Toro.the reason I did give this a low grade was it had a one sided propogandized twist that was sadly so one sided for Bolshevism that the story did not need . History written by the so-called victores is rampant enough today, this was not nessesary in this story line.","11 December 2022",2,3,23
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","At first it is not the story we knew. Things are changed creatively, and this is the reason i enjoy the story.

When this small creature tries to think about what is good and what is bad, when heart always does things how it likes, never thinks. Basically we like to see new story, i am happy this is not same old one.

Happily the story is new and enjoyable. Hope you enjoy it too.","14 December 2022",8,0,0
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","I think the initial animation style flirts hard with the uncanny valley. But the story itself I think was great. The moral of this story seems to be understood throughout the retelling. ""Life if precious and impermanent, cherish life while it's here.""

I think the initial awakening of Pinocchio was almost unbearable, but it also endeared the Pinocchio youth to you as you realized that he would always be perfectly gullible for the whole movie.

The villains were well drawn and consistent to there person.

Overall I gave this an 8/10 because it was a unique art-style with a good story with a great message.

There are parts that will challenge your youngest viewers, between the ages of 4-6 I might stay clear of, many because of the death component.

Also because of the setting, (fascist italy) you'll definitely want to be aware if your 10-15 year-old is watching it, they will have a different set of questions about fascism and youth.

Would I show this in a school setting as a recreational activity or as a field trip activity? No. I think this one is more a home movie, let each family watch it themselves and decide how to discuss the topics.","2 January 2023",8,0,0

"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","Probably a good story and great animation but Pinocchio is so annoying that it makes the film unbearable. On top of that, the singing was almost as annoying and gave me a headache. If you removed the singing and toned down the whinging, you would probably have a half decent film. As it was I could only cope with 30 minutes.

The best bit was the writer from Moulin Rouge being the narrator using the exact same style, tone and possibly dialogue.

The most confusing bit is the number of 10 star reviews and almost zero negative reviews. I had to triple check I was watching the same film.

Anyway if you insist on watching it, turn on the subtitles and switch the sound off.","21 December 2022",3,4,13
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","A nice portrayal of the lovely story of Pinocchio the wooden puppet.

The story is well paced and the setting is delightful with clever modern technological touches.

For me, Jimmy Cricket does look a little scary and is a big contrast to the sweet little insect featured in Disneys cartoon version. For a child younger than age 7 maybe a bit too freaky. The Fairy who grants life to the puppet is rather brief and she does not remind him about the consequences of lying! Also Pinocchio remains unclothed for this version.

The enchanting music of Desplat compliments the story nicely, and the song My Son is beautiful.

A good effort and an enjoyable film.","11 December 2022",8,0,0

The film is also beautifully animated. Every frame of this film is a labour of love and there is so much detail in everything from the characters to the backgrounds.

"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","I'll admit, I couldn't finish the movie.

The tempo was slow, the dialogue uninspired and the movie just felt stale. So many details that didn't make sense. When the movie beginss, Gepetto looks old, but some 20+ years later, he looks the same. And why did Carlo look like an old man? Why was Jesus on the cross built like a puppet? So many questionable creative decisions.

And that's is just my opinion as a cinema goer, as a teacher of stop motion animation the list of woes goes on. Why were the eyes of the cricket designed without pupils? Has he no soul? What's up with the the timing of the scenes? Most are sluggish and unrhythmical - the scene with the falling axe springs to mind. As I tell my students all the time: use an appropriate pace for the various scenes. An axe will fall fast, but a feather will fall slowly. An angry driver might drive fast, whereas an elderly lady might go more slowly.

I watched this as one who has just experienced loss. As one who is mourning the loss of life. It has been tough to process what has happened and this movie helped me do that. It shows how wonderful life is. Full of love and relationship. At the same time it shows the fragility and how hurtful the loss of loved ones can be. How it can changes you.

It also shows the beauty of a father and son. I'm a sucker for a good father and son relationship.

"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","I'm still shocked at the reviews that received this film when really the story has really nothing to do with Pinocchio. Did we watch the same thing?, I mean. What is Pinocchio doing firing guns in World War 2? When he should be having his non-warlike misadventures in 1826 (that's more than 100 years before the arrival of fascism). Let's say the director took some creative liberties, but can we still call it that when he basically changed everything about the story, from the beginning to the very end, removing important characters and adding new ones that didn't have anything to do with the original tale as written by Collodi. I'm trying not to give away spoilers but I feel like perhaps it would have been better and less harming if they had just come up with a completely different main character and a completely different name. But then I guess they needed the big name to sell it better?

I can't help but think about the recent movie Blonde and the scandal it produced after its premiere, people were outraged, they still are. How the director went too far with their creative liberties. And yet Del Toro followed that exact same pattern and he's getting praised for it?","28 December 2022",6,0,3

This is not an objective point of view. Director Del toro tried to be Tim Burton but ended up being a bad copycat. If we consider the director's other films, it is seen that he uses similar imaginary elements and it cannot be said to be successful in transferring these imaginary themes and characters to the figure. The images are of the type that will create trauma for children, so much that my child (4) cried after watching it. The film is exaggerated!","13 December 2022",2,6,25
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","Del Toro does something incredibly important and beautiful with his Pinocchio: reclaiming this legend from both the fascists and the 1940s Disney executives. His film resists the ideological approach to Pinocchio and penetrates deep into history. Pinocchio comes to life during World War II and is exploited by various tyrannical forces to do whatever they want. To them, being a boy, or a real human in general, means following orders.

Del Toro's adaptation breaks down the traditional morality of the story of Pinocchio and pulls out a more complex and beautiful meaning from it. Anyone who says this anime isn't suitable for children doesn't take children seriously as human beings. Del Toro's Pinocchio is a rich, beautiful and thought-provoking animation for all ages and can mean a ""real"", moral, decent and lovable person to everyone.","17 December 2022",8,0,1
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","First off, I so wish I could view this wonderful work in a theater on a big screen with surround sound, too. The stop motion animation is a tribute to all the artists who made this production possible. I'll not go into the story line or the ending except to say I was holding back teary eyes. Every boy should enjoy but what does one say to the little boys who grow up without a Father? That's my teary eyed response.

I remain in awe of those creatives who made this movie possible. The music and sound track are a tribute to Alexandre Desplat creative genius at matching the music to the emotional content.","13 December 2022",10,0,0
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","A magnificent film, with a magical world and a very beautiful lesson. It is a film with a dark and sad atmosphere... with happy moments, just like life itself. It teaches you to appreciate the little moments with your loved ones, because we don't know when it will be the last time with them. It teaches us the fragility of life. The stop-motion gives it a point... it's not something you're used to but a better technique couldn't have been used to tell such a beautiful story... sad but beautiful. The setting and the time add incalculable value, well written and developed characters. Simply a masterpiece.","16 December 2022",10,1,3
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","'Baffling!' is the only word I can think to describe this film. It's too dark for kids and too childish for adults. For a film considering itself to be mature, it quickly undermines itself with flat slapstick humour and even a song about farts! - It really begs to question: who is the target audience?!

Fundamentally, Pinocchio is an annoying, bratty and selfish character. If the original fairy tale is anything to go by, Pinocchio is a happy, well-to-do child, but his innocence is easily mislead. Pinocchio learns through guidance the difference between right and wrong. However in Guillermo del Toro's version, Pinocchio is immediately stubborn, overbearing and often throws a tantrum when he doesn't get his way. This would have been a unique spin on the character, if not for the fact he is wildly inconsistent. His character switches personality between sweet and naive to stroppy and arrogant instantaneously as if having some sort of bipolar disorder.

Cricket is tasked with being Pinocchio's mentor/conscious; much like the original. These characters however spend the whole film apart, thus rendering the task of Cricket giving guidance to Pinocchio pointless - A huge miss-opportunity to develop their relationship! Cricket's character is completely side-lined here and has literally no purpose within this adaptation of the story.

The story seems to plod along via a series of convenient circumstances. Set against the backdrop of World War fascist Italy, this is an interesting time period to set the film within, although it feels very tacked on (shoehorn in a joke about Mussolini I'm sure kids will understand). The primary beats of the film, much like the Disney version, is the puppet show and the big climax with the sea creature. The war feels really nothing more than just a side-plot.

From a technical standpoint, the animation is excellent and deserves every bit of praise it gets. The look and design of the characters are great... although the overall look is almost too polished, I did question whether or not it was actually stop-motion or CGI to look like stop-motion *shrugs* The films biggest weakness is essentially its clunky story and characters i.e. The most important bits!

If I'm going to watch an adaptation of Pinocchio, it might as well be the 1940's Disney animation: A film with more charm, better voice acting, better music (the songs in this version are forgettable!) better moral virtues and a titular character you wouldn't get excited when teased of being set on fire!

Ultimately, Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio is an unnecessarily bleak adaptation of the children's story marred by its arrogance of being something both unique and simultaneously derivative. A great film to show your kids if you want them to grow up sad!","31 December 2022",4,1,2
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","This retelling of ""Pinnochio"" is a treat, to be sure, and has a weight that permeates throughout that you won't recall from the Disney version you probably remember. It's a children's movie that respects the audience (as they should), and it has questions to ask and lessons to teach that are built upon and relevant to the real and complicated world we all live in.

The backdrop of fascist Italy is a big part of the aforementioned weightiness and provides a grounded frame for the plot, but I feel like it could have been put to more use in the Podesta's subplot. I loved the animation and sets, and I loved the fantasy elements a la Wood Sprite and Death. I didn't like the monkey, only because it seemed to always be shouting. Pinocchio also begins life as a bit insufferable; though, I would say it's in character for a new and naïve boy.

I think ""Pinocchio"" is very good and well-made. I think I would have been a smarter kid for seeing it when I was younger. Now I think I can appreciate it, but it's hard to be excited about a story that I've already heard.","23 December 2022",6,0,0
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","Magical. 15 years of work well spent. The creatures, characters, and emotions all feel so palpable. It has a historic twist being set during the rise of Mussolini which makes the plot more relevant and interesting. I honestly think it's one of the most sincere and excellent executed movies of the decade. It will become a classic I am sure and not just because it has Cate Blanchet as erratic money. It's also worth watching the 'how it's made' accompaniment movie as it's honestly an innovative and creative work of art.

All I can say is you're missing out if you don't watch this beautiful movie.","25 December 2022",10,1,2
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","I like Guillermo Del Toro but his last few movies have been a bit dull. Interesting themes, beautiful to look at but like Pinocchios torso they're hollow.

This is far too long for a kids movie and seemingly for no reason. It really drags in parts. Terrible casting choice for Pinocchio. His voice is so irritating! His initial naivety and wonderment about the world he suddenly finds himself in should have been funny and whimsical. Instead I found myself hoping he'd turn back into a real puppet and shut up.

I liked the idea of updating the story but I feel like it didn't add anything. Just a lot of side characters who's storylines felt rushed or unnecessary. If this is aimed at an older audience then it would've suited an even darker take on the story and if it was purely for kids it would benefit from some more fun and excitement.

So overall pretty dull and too long. Gets a 6 for the great character design and animation but honestly not anywhere near the brilliance of what Laika has been putting out over the last ten years.","20 January 2023",6,0,0
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","This film was so incredibly well crafted. The animation was amazing, the music was charming, the theme of life, love and hope were inspiring. There was also an underlying theme of being yourself. The added commentary about Mussolini and the fascists was fascinating as well as the portrayal of the villainess puppeteer. The actors who ""voiced"" the main characters are well known and did an excellent job. This is probably the best film that Netflix has offered in a long time. I would recommend it for everyone in the family. I think though it's best if adults watch it with children. There are some scary parts to it. In summary, excellent movie.","14 December 2022",10,0,0
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","Personally, I'm a fan of most of Del Toro's work, and I also love animations made by Stop Motion. So, I'm suspect to review this movie.

This reinterpretation by Del Toro of the classic fairy tale is simply wonderful. The mythological touch constantly present in the director's works brings a darker and more mystical air to the film.

At the same time, the contextualization of the plot in Italy during World War II, the cultural, religious and historical aspects added to the film bring a very inviting immersion to the viewer.

The combination of mysticism and realism added to the works is quite interesting. This all adds up to perfect stop motion animation and excellent character design, make this movie a work of modern art. Amazing!","23 January 2023",9,0,0
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","I really liked this film. I can't say I loveI it, cause this wasn't a film for my taste, but because it was a Guillermo del Toro film I had to see it and he really delivered. It's hard not to compare it to the live-action version Disney made. But we all know that their live-action adaptations are very similar to the original ones. This film feels fresh and unique. It's certainly pretty dark and I think that's what fairy tales should be. They're not what Disney delivers, they don't have happy endings. A nice example is the original Little Mermaid tale where she dies in the end cause she loved the prince too much to kill him.

Pinocchio has a happier ending, but it's very bittersweet and it really touched me and that's because Guillermo knows how to tell a good story. He also knows his symbolisms and that really shows in this film as well. The voice acting wasn't outstanding, but it was pretty good. The one that wasn't so good imo was Ewan McGregor cause in my opinion he's better in acting than voice acting. It's a different kettle of fish. He still does a good job, but it could have been better.

This film feels so fresh and it's a fun film to watch, but for children who are easily frightened it might not be the right film for them, because as I mentioned this is pretty dark, with war and other themes that are pretty dark, at least for a film meant for children. The ending really surprised me and was also pretty dark. That's the word I would use to describe this film. It's a great film and it's a really fun watch and has Guillermo del Toro written all over it.","18 December 2022",,0,0
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","The film was dark and gloomy, this also illustrates why the film was supposed to be for the age of 15+. The animation was amazing and wonderful, really the animation was great. The film was not the favorite film of most Netflix children, in general it was not aimed at adults. But the adults would say that the movie is too childish, if they made the movie for 15+ it would be a simply amazing movie. The movie was also boring. In my opinion, the movie deviated too much from the book, on which the movie was based. Only the origin story of the grandfather and the boy was a lovely and beautiful origin story.","17 January 2023",6,0,3
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","This is the first movie I will write a review for.

In my eyes this movie succeeds in everything with the story it is telling. Everything to the old hardened Gepetto to the monster that is Monstro. The stop motion animation just emphasises everything in the story as well. The message and the lesson will stay with me forever. It is the most complete telling of the original Pinocchio story with so much heart, soul and emotion, but still with a completely original way to tell it. The setting is really interesting as well and shows a rather dark side of history usually not shown in movies with this age rating. It is a very mature movie, with very mature themes.

The songs and music in general are also very special. It is amazingly well crafted and blands in with the storytelling really well.

I must also say that the voice actors were amazing. Every character was very believable and the voices matched perfectly.

Hopefully this movie will always remain recognised as the piece of art it is.","16 December 2022",10,1,3
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","I love ""Pinocchio"" and its unique story and characters more than anything. I've watched every movie or series that have published about this adorable story. The only one that I didn't really like was Disney's Pinocchio(Live Action) due to not-really good actings and un-necessary changes. But this one was incredible.

I watched it after Disney's version and I was waiting for facing with something normal and not-wonderful, like Disney's version. But I really surprised and watched it without pausing until the end. Everything was absolutely brilliant and magical. One of the points that make this version special is the scenes which clearly talk about historical and political things communicated to Italy and fascism. You can realize how propagandas had affected on people thoughts and showed them an adorable and bright picture of an Italy with fascism. You can see the ones who disagree with dictatorship and fascism and their hard and arduous life with soldiers and the ones who seek fascism.

I can't really talk about it anymore due to the fear of spoiling, but I'm able to suggest you this amazing film to watch it with your family and recognize new points about the classic and always memorable story, ""Pinocchio"".","16 January 2023",8,0,0
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","I'm going to be ranting and raving about this for years. Guillermo must be a wizard, because his latest project is peppered with so much magic and

This movie is pure magic, one of the hardest things to create for the screen. And del Toro has beautifully remade this story for the ages. This is an absolute win - go and watch it!

"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","It wasnt even suppose to be a hit on Gepetto and Carlos town. They say the planes were on their way back home from their bomb raid. They unloaded the bombs to lessen the load, but what did that matter to Gepetto life as he knew it was forever changed. He was dead inside his son dead. He did plant the pinecone that his son had found. It was a fine cone no apparant dents or missing pieces. It even grew to a young pine next to Carlos grave. This evening the grief and alcohol got the best of Gepetto, never underestimate a man when he sets his mind too it. If god doesnt want to bring his son back than he will make it happen himself. Using the craft he knows. Wood and puppets. A feature that shines on the pure merrit of its animation and stop motion. I often feel that many new features despite being well crafted lacks a certain originality, but here you know straight away that the feature is Guillermo Del Toro. Its wondrous and full of life in the scenes. The story itself isnt necessarily original but we get a different scenario as the plot is moved forward to both of the world wars. It gets a bit busy in the final act but its a minor gripe all things considered. Some of the voice acting which has a great cast uses that fake accent you see sometimes to make them sound a bit italian despite speaking italian. Its not a dealbreaker but just dont do that. Speak proper english or why not italian. This could be a front runner for best animated feature at the oscars.","17 December 2022",8,0,0
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","I couldn't get past the first few minutes because I was so confused by the British/Scottish voices for this beloved Italian fable.

I am sure it's a beautiful film but in this day and age are we still getting it so wrong and not honouring the origins of stories and who should be telling them? Do we need to keep assuming some accents are more valued/easier to understand than others? Honestly, I'm lost for words on this.

I'd expect GDT to have got this one right. 1/10 for the lack of authenticity and the slap in the face to my Italian heritage.

2. The sequence of the story is perfect and the journey it takes you on is compelling.

3. The cast and the music is sublime.

I see some people on here being critical about the realism of the film? It's a fantasy movie with puppets lol. Anyone that has problems with a child watching this is gonna have a kid that's way to sheltered from real life. Even all the adult themes are so subtle that a kid wouldn't even notice them.

"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","This was one of the most beautiful animation films (if not the most beautiful) that I've ever watched. The story line was deep and meaningful. The music was whimsical and really perfect for each scene, and I usually hate when characters start singing. My favorite was the father singing ""My Son"" (Ewan McGregor has a fantastic voice) I watched this with my children and the animation was so good and detailed we all really enjoyed watching this film. My children are 10 and 11 which I don't know that I'd watch it with children much younger as there are some darker but meaningful scenes. Saying that it is by far our favorite rendition of Pinocchio.

Guillermo Del Toro's Pinocchio is a beautiful film with excellent music, acting, and of course visuals. The writing is the best I've seen in years! Good use of foreshadowing, payoff, and modern humor. I also love how he took inspiration from biblically accurate angels, which only just became popularized. It boggles my mind how someone can create something so wonderful. I may go as far as to say it's better than Disney's classic! This may be the most impactful film I've ever seen. I know that may sound exaggerative, but I have a soft spot for works of art such as this. Aspiring writers, take notes!","11 December 2022",10,0,0
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","Wow! The best animated film for me in years.

I had my doubts before watching the film, but it blown me away, it's really really good!

I think is really important to have films to open deep conversations with kids, this is about sadness and grief, and what you can do to deal with pain and suffering, individually and collectively.

Not every film for children has to be bubbly, inocent, sweet and soft. If you are looking for that this is not for you.

This is for open hearts that know that life has difficult times, losses, pain, but you can still be good, caring, and nice, and must of all yourself!

Would recommend it to any fan of animation since it's not afraid to explore some serious topics and deals with life and death masterfully.

It had me tear up in a couple of instances as I was not prepared for this new interpretation of the age-old story.

The Voice acting was simply amazing!!! Stop motion has been used masterfully here. In the beginning, I had to go through the uncanny valley but after the first 10 minutes, I was set to go.

"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio","I watched the movie together with my son (he is 7 years old). I think it was a great movie but I think that all this part with 2nd world war, fascists, Duce Musollini, the heil Hitler greeting is to much for a 7 year old boy, or even for an older child. We had the problem that my son started to use the heil Hitler greeting and we needed to explain that this is not good, forbidden etc. But it was also very complicated for us to explain to our son why is it so. Now we are praying to God that he doesn't show this in School :D Just because of this part I would not watch it again with a younger child.","19 December 2022",5,0,5
"Marcel the Shell with Shoes On","My cold, black, cynical core was absolutely melted by this adorable story. Given this, I believe it is truly impossible to watch this film and still hold negativity in your soul by the time the credits roll.

Jaw-droppingly fluid stop-motion animation adds such a vibrant life to the world of Marcel the shell and his grandmother. It feels lived-in, yet at the same time, lonely, and this production design adds a great deal to Marcel's emotional journey.

The comedy is constant and absolutely spectacular. The witty dialogue takes jabs at the oddities of both human and ""shell"" behavior, but also often carries a surprisingly poignant depth that I did not expect.

Marcel's world is small, and thus the things he finds joy in are small. I don't think I have ever seen a film so effectively portray the beauty of the ""little things"" in life.

This is a film with such a pervasive sense of gratitude for the gift of life-for the gift of opportunities to change, progress, and grow that we are often presented with in this life. It's a story about family and the necessity of the simple sharing of experiences with other people.

Coming out of the theater, I felt such a profound sense of love for the people around me and for the beautiful things both natural and man-made in this world. And if giving someone a feeling like that isn't the mark of a master artist, I don't know what is.

It's a masterpiece of creativity and simplicity. It's one of the best films of the year.","15 July 2022",10,63,77

"Marcel the Shell with Shoes On","""Sometimes I find my mind wandering, thinking, ""What would my family think?"" Do you think they could be out there?""

Marcel, an adorable one-inch-tall shell living alone with his grandmother Connie seek to find their long-lost community with the help of a documentary filmmaker. Based on the widely popular YouTube series, Marcel the Shell With Shoes On revives the adorable shell in what is quite possibly the most adorable movie ever. I remember watching the YouTube videos a few times, but it was never something I fell for. However, this film re-introduced me to the world of Marcel and had me caring for every second of the runtime. For such a simple and silly idea, this film exceeds in sharing a heartfelt story. Everything about it is wholesome. For those who aren't familiar with the original shorts, the film easily updates those and throws easter eggs around. The script is incredibly funny. There would be times that we'd miss a few sentences into the next thing because the audience was laughing at the last thing. Some of the humor won't land with everyone because it's such a strange tone, but all of it worked for me. I thought it was written very well. There are emotionally gripping lines and thought provoking inquiries. It's one of those movies that makes you reflect on your own life and happiness.

Jenny Slate has never been better. Obviously this is just voice acting as a small shell, but this feels like the role that will define her career. We also have the talents of Isabella Rossellini and writer/director Dean Fleischer-Camp acting. Rossellini's character is incredibly well written and brings an emotional aspect to the film. I know it's not voice acting, but there's one really beautiful moment she has that's been playing through my head for the past week now. I like that Dean Fleischer-Camp acted in this because it gives it an intimate and unique angle to filmmaking. One of the most striking elements is the cinematography. I thought it was beautifully shot and does more than you'd think. Also, the score was very unique and I can't wait for them to release it. There are a few moments strewn about that didn't quite land. Sometimes it moves a little too fast with some montages in the beginning. Other times, it doesn't feel like we've stayed on the moment long enough. Still, you cannot deny the power these little shells hold on the story. I really loved Marcel the Shell With Shoes On. I can see this becoming a comfort movie for me and an instant crowd hit.","23 May 2022",8,37,50
"Marcel the Shell with Shoes On","Seriously. Before you reach for that keypad and say anything unkind about Marcel (who has never said an unkind word about anyone, and generally keeps his opinions to himself), remember that our culture elevated BORAT to cult status back in 2006. So, if BORAT was great film-making, Marcel will need a new pair of shoes -- and probably a tux -- to accept his long-overdue Oscar. Even before this project got to the big screen (or small device used in place of a big screen) it was already an internet sensation for voice actress Jenny Slate. Jenny's tone and delivery are so delicately nuanced that it makes the award given to FINDING NEMO back in 2004 look like an accounting error. Words like DELIGHTFUL, CAPTIVATING, and UNIQUE don't do Marcel justice. I would ask the little guy to step up here and say a few words for himself, but right now I think he is trying to find a way to make bird sculptures from ice cream. Ever since the feature release, he doesn't sleep much. Or, if he does, he keeps one eye open. ((Designated ""IMDb Top Reviewer.""

"Marcel the Shell with Shoes On","Marcel The Shell With Shoes On is a sweet, moving and loving journey into the life of an instantly lovable seashell named Marcel (Jenny Slate). I love how this stop-motion animated film, presented as a documentary, handles life's mysteries, dangers, grief and friendships with wisdom, grace and humor.

Marcel and his sassy grandmother Connie (Isabella Rossellini) share a big home used as an AirBnB that was once full of friends who have mysteriously disappeared. When a new guest, Dean (Dean Fleischer-Camp) arrives, he sets out to document Marcel and help discover what happened to the missing friends. Dean films the inventive and clever ways that Marcel and Connie go about their lives as shells, from gathering food, traveling about and taking care of each other. Marcel persuades Dean to share the mysterious loss of his community, which leads to an interview on 60 Minutes with Leslie Stahl. All the attention and celebrity fuss prove to be too much for the aging grandmother as she does her best to convince Marcel she is healthy. I love how Marcel takes care of Connie.

Marcel is sweet and caring with a practical approach to solving problems. He is inventive and optimistic. And he has a fuzzy pet lint named Alan! His grandmother, Connie, is at once amused and annoyed by Marcel's overprotectiveness. They share a unique bond. The stop-motion animation brings to life these characters in a wonderful, believable way. They become your friends you care about quickly. My favorite part is how Marcel travels around the big house with speed and efficiency- in a tennis ball!

Marcel The Shell With Shoes On addresses a variety of life's challenges with gentle wisdom, quiet grace, and sly humor. Marcel and Connie learn to adjust to the mysterious disappearance of their community, a house full of friends. They persevere and seek help from Dean to help solve the mystery while dealing with the new found ""celebrity"" attention and the disruption to their peaceful existence. Marcel is stoic and brave in the face of loss and grateful and welcoming at the sound of emergency. We would all benefit from walking in Marcel's shoes!

I give Marcel The Shell With Shoes On 5 out of 5 star and recommend it for ages 6 to 18, plus adults. It opens in select theaters June 24, 2022 and nationwide July 15, 2022. By Madeleine H., KIDS FIRST!","7 July 2022",10,14,21
"Marcel the Shell with Shoes On","Greetings again from the darkness. For proof that social media and the internet can be used for good, I offer as evidence this film from writer-director Dean Fleisher-Camp and co-writers Elizabeth Holm, Nick Paley, and Jenny Slate. The first 'Marcel' short film hit the internet in 2010 and was such a hit that there were two follow-up short films and a best-selling picture book. Now expanded to a feature length film of 90 minutes, the innovative and curious premise holds up due to the fully-formed character of a precious one-googly-eyed mollusk shell wearing ... yes ... shoes.

Why do we connect with Marcel? Well, the instantly recognized voice created by Jenny Slate plays a huge part. There is a welcoming innocence in the wispy tone, and when combined with the exceptional writing, the result is a relatable character full of warmth and wit, and pain and humor. Marcel is naïve, yet persistent. He's someone we like and pull for. The story is told via faux-documentary as a filmmaker (played by director Fleisher-Camp) stays in the Airbnb where Marcel lives with his aging grandmother Connie (voiced by Isabella Rossellini). During interviews, we learn that Marcel longs for his family and community that was disrupted when the home's original owners broke up and moved out. Since then, Marcel has looked after his grandmother and helped her tend the garden. They have been quite creative in their use of household resources, including a tennis ball for transportation.

The filmmaker posts the interviews online and soon Marcel has a huge following, giving him hope that his family can be tracked down. This leads to a terrific ""60 Minutes"" segment with journalist Leslie Stahl. The best description I can offer of Marcel is adorable - not a word I use very often. Marcel forces us to view the world through a child's eye, but it's important to note, that while young children may find Marcel cute, the dialogue, wit, and life issues covered will be way over their heads (though not offensive in the least). Young kids (under 10) should probably stick to the shorts. The sad and painful context is balanced by sweetness and optimism. Marcel's story inspires us to embrace all stages of life with an open heart and mind - dealing with grief and sadness, while coming out the other side with spirit intact.

A24 specializes in distributing innovative and creative movies, and this certainly qualifies. It's not really a mockumentary because it's not mocking anything. The stop-motion approach in documentary style may initially seem like whimsy, but we quickly realize it's more substantive. Individual strength and the power of community are on full display, and somehow Marcel the Shell teaches us ... while wearing shoes.

"Marcel the Shell with Shoes On","Marcel is adorable, his eye gestures, the kind of bizarre things he does, or the words coming out of his tiny mouth, will melt your heart. You will fall in love with him. The creators knew this, hence, they put more resources & emphasis on Marcel's personality & his outward appearance than they did on the deeper lying implications of the writing.

Whilst the movie had a whole lot to talk about the necessity of being in a healthy communal rapport, the importance of being in a family, and the kind of impact they can have on your life as well as on your life's choices, but that never got to a point where those same set of notions came to be anything more than naive interventionism.

Do not get me wrong, it still is a competent feature that gradually grew on my conscience and I'm glad that it was able to fulfill a lot of people's wishes and expectations but if you ask me, I more often than not found myself yearning for some closure, something more profound.","27 September 2022",7,5,7
"Marcel the Shell with Shoes On","Touching and cute, and surprisingly, didn't feel padded out to stretch it to feature length. Both Jenny Slate and Isabella Rossellini created characters whom you care about.

I did have some trouble understanding some of the words Marcel was saying, not a problem I've ever had with Jenny Slate in her other movies. It might have been the sound system in the theater; other people had the same problem.

If you are at all whimsy-tolerant, this is a move worth seeing.","13 May 2022",7,14,22
"Marcel the Shell with Shoes On","I went and saw this last night and was just blown away. I was so captivated by everything about this movie and when it was over my friend and I both wanted to watch it again. We just sighed and walked out of the theater so happy and so inspired. There were moments of poignancy, hilarity, I just believe this to be one of the best movies ever made for its message and delivery. It's exactly what we need right now in this world.","14 July 2022",10,34,48
"Marcel the Shell with Shoes On","After separating from his wife, Dean (Dean Fleisher Camp) moves into an AirBnB where he meets Marcel (Jenny Slate) an anthropomorphic shell with red shoes who lives in the AirBnB with his grandmother Nana Connie (Isabella Rossellini) living alongside the various occupants of the house. Dean makes a documentary about Marcel's every day life with Connie and the online shorts blow-up to massive levels which Marcel thinks could possibly be used to help reunite him with his long lost family.

Marcel the Shell with Shoes On is a feature length expansion on the series of online shorts made by Dean Fleisher Camp back in 2010 that featured an anthropomorphic shell doing various activities and making various comments that became quite popular upon being posted on Youtube. The film premiered at the 2021 Telluride Film Festival to critical acclaim and was subject to an intense bidding war eventually being won by A24. Released in the Summer of 2022 the movie became a minor sleeper doing reasonably well at the box office for an indie title and has received acclaim from critics and audiences alike with buzz that it will be a contender for Best Animated Feature at the Academy Awards, and rightly so because this film is a heartwarming treat that everyone should see.

With Jenny Slate and Dean Fleisher Camp reuniting from their work together on the original three online shorts, the movie manages to maintain the simplistic charms that won over people in the first place while also expanding upon the story and world created. Jenny Slate's Marcel is still as endearingly cute as he was in the shorts but there's also some quiet sadness to the character that was present in the original shorts but is expanded upon here. The relationship between Marcel and Dean or Marcel and his grandmother Nana Connie are filled with subtle but striking nuances that aim right for the heartstrings and throughout the film there's a strong core about the value of family and community with Marcel's attempts at finding them using his newfound fame often met with frustration such as his line ""this isn't a community it's an audience"" carrying some strong weight to it and it also leads to some funny moments where TikTokers find Marcel's house and start taking pictures in front of it instead of actually helping find Marcel's family as he asked in an online call to action. The movie also features some charming stop motion animation of Marcel and various other elements in the film provided by noted Stop-Motion producers the Chiodo Brothers and their work is no less impressive here than it has been in their prior projects.

Marcel the Shell with Shoes On deserves every bit of the adulation it's been awarded and is a solid showcase of Dean Fleischer Camp's, some great animation from the Chiodos, and solid performances from Rossellini, Camp, and Slate. Highly recommended.","16 December 2022",10,3,4
"Marcel the Shell with Shoes On","Marcel the Shell with Shoes On is remarkably somber for a film so cute; it is a film about small adorable characters and animated inanimate objects spawned from the idea that (to quote the director) ""if an object is neglected long enough, it develops a spirit of its own"".

Based on Jenny Slate's and Dean Fleischer Camp's beloved web series about a tiny shell with a big heart and even bigger shoes (the popularity of which is acknowledged by the characters/""interviewees"" in this film), it's a stop-motion/live-action mockumentary that is sure to make you cry tears of sadness and even more certain to inspire tears of ""MY GOD, THIS IS SO PURE AND PRECIOUS"". Something to that effect.

Some of you might worry that the film is merely cutesy (which is different than being genuinely cute). But the picture is actually rather interesting on a technical level.

I'd love to see a featurette on just how much of the stop-motion animation is truly stop-motion, and how they made said animations interact so seamlessly with the live-action footage (which is filmed to make the world that surrounds Marcel seem a large and confusing one indeed). Another noteworthy behind-the-scenes detail -- that might have influenced the themes and tone of the film in some way -- is the fact that, whereas Fleischer-Camp and Slate were married when they created the original web series together, they worked on the movie as exes.

Last but not least: like all great things, Marcel the Shell with Shoes On also contains an appearance by Nathan Fielder. Why are you still here?","24 October 2022",8,2,2

"Marcel the Shell with Shoes On","What an absolutely adorable movie!

This offbeat movie is the antidote to every hyperactive, corporatized, disposable animated film that's been foisted on audiences over the years. It's calm, quiet, sweet, and tackles very serious themes while staying extremely funny, but in a low key way. Jenny Slate does some of the best voice work I've ever heard. I would never have identified her as the voice of Marcel if I hadn't just known in advance that it was her. Listening to her made me realize how rare it is for a voice actor to truly disappear into an animated character.

At the risk of sounding like a cliche, the world needs more movies like this right now.

This is the first year since the pandemic that we can return to theaters with more ease and the New York based studio delivered us Everything Everywhere All at Once and now Marcel. Both were so much better than I expected. We are given an adorable (and tiny) character on the big screen who graces us with innocence and a poignant outlook. This is genuinely a great family film, filled with sharp comedy, deep emotion, and astute observations on identity, community, and the fast paced world we live in. I recommend this one to all.

"Marcel the Shell with Shoes On","This movie is a simple delight. Marcel is endlessly wholesome and there is a surprising depth to the plot. Though the majority of the story takes place inside a small home, there is a far-reaching connectivity with Marcel.

This movie goes to show that simplicity sells. There are no giant explosions, mind-bending plot twists or complicated romantic entanglements. There is just a shell with shoes who asks honest questions and pulls at your heartstrings over and over again.

I laughed, I cried and I found incredibly peace watching this little guy.

"Marcel the Shell with Shoes On","This was a charming, heartfelt, and funny movie about a tiny little shell named ""Marcel"" and his grandmother Connie.

Also liked the main protagonist's keeper or whatever he was, I think their bond between these two fellers was realistic and fun. But the movie didn't do to me what I was maybe expecting. It has some nice concepts to explore and it was interesting enough to keep me engaged, but not enough to make me cry. It's still a good movie, but a rewatch isn't necessary here.

"Marcel the Shell with Shoes On","An intimately crafted & affectionately told comedy drama concerning an anthropomorphic shell, Marcel the Shell with Shoes On is as adorable as it is life-affirming and makes for an interesting blend of animation & live-action, for it takes a simple premise to offer a fascinating look at life & its surprises that makes it worth living, all captured through the eyes of a 1-inch tall talking shell.

Co-written & directed by Dean Fleischer Camp in his feature directorial debut, the film is derived from his short film series of the same name and incorporates those earlier clips into its very own story. The plot follows Marcel's journey to finding his long-lost family and covers his interactions with our director, all done with enormous care, compassion & understanding to make it resonate with the heart.

The animated characters in real-world background never distract from the conversation at play and it shifts from whimsical to poignance with a welcome naturalness. There is an undercurrent of tragedy & heartbreak here but the environment remains wholesome & inviting on the surface. The shells brim with humanity & benefit from splendid voice work yet it still feels a bit drawn out for a 90 mins film & gets repetitive.

Overall, Marcel the Shell with Shoes On is an endearing & heartwarming delight that will strike a heartfelt chord with many if not all and serves as a reminder of things we take for granted. It's a story that showcases the true value of community & the transformative power of friendship, and is witty, amusing & touching throughout. It does get weary the longer it goes on and could've done more with better pace & shorter runtime. Go see it anyway.","8 December 2022",,1,2
"Marcel the Shell with Shoes On","This is the dose of wholesomeness that I need everyday.

For such a simple concept, Dean Fleisher Camp created a brilliant and heartfelt story that I'm sure will touch the heart of all audiences. It's weird that I felt so much for a one-inch shell that tried to find his family while taking care of his grandma. It was practically impossible to hold back the tears. Marcel's snappy dialogues and nativity made him an adorable kid. His journey was all-around wholesome. There's some heartbreaking moments, but overall it yielded such satisfaction that there were tears of joy from me.

The movie also touched on the topic of popularity and how fans treat famous people. It can be a source of stress when fans do not know their boundaries.

Overall, I think this is a simple yet near-perfect joyful ride that filled my heart with happiness. It's a big dose of dopamine and serotonin. 9.5-10/10.","25 July 2022",10,4,12

I loved Jenny Slate as Marcel; the character was adorable, and I liked seeing how Marcel moves around the house and what inventions he uses to do every day or weird things like using honey to walk up walls.

The stop-motion animation for Marcel and the other small characters like him are nicely animated. The animation was pretty to look at and I liked how the characters move around by foot.

The cinematography is pretty with lots of great visuals. Around the house and shots of the little houses for Marcel were nice to look at, I also liked how the mini houses for him are designed.

There are effective emotional moments that will make you tear up, and the plot is sweet and there are little funny scenes throughout. I recommend giving Marcel the Shell with Shoes On (2022) a watch, because it is nice having something cute to watch occasionally.","4 September 2022",8,2,6

"Marcel the Shell with Shoes On","Marcel the Shell with Shoes On (2021) :
Brief Review -

A funny and moving mocumentary phenomenon passes by as a shell-breaking animated flick. Dean Fleischer Camp and Jenny Slate have found an awfully good idea for using shell species to create a new kind of genre, 'docu-drama animated flick'. The idea is indeed out of this world, even though the story doesn't seem to be cracking the same phenomenon. It's a shell-breaking topic with a decent storyline, but it keeps you hooked with its processing storytelling. Marcel and Connie are shells, living in Dean's house, who make them famous by uploading the documented videos on YouTube. Marcel is overwhelmed to see the response and immense publicity, but somewhere he feels lonely in this world without his family. Marcel wishes to reconcile with his family, who were separated from him by the previous house's owner a couple of years ago. Dean tries to help him, but Connie's degrading health puts a break on Marcel's fast-moving journey. The film captures emotions very well, and that too in very human ways. Though, the comedy and quirkiness are pretty low. I would have loved to see more engaging conversations here, as the Shell seemed too confident and human-friendly. Lesley Stahl's cameo is well placed, smartly thought out, and well put in this story. No exaggeration in dramatic conflicts whatsoever, purely organic methods of fiction, cinematic liberty, and a basic emotional touch make this one an interesting watch. Dean Fleischer Camp, Jenny Slate, Nick Paley and Elisabeth Holm's story wins you in the first 20 minutes, and you are so into their world that you don't care what happens in the next hour. Camp's direction is fairly good. The pressure of a shell-breaking idea is handled well by him. Overall, Marcel the Shell with Shoes On is an engaging affair with some funny moments and emotional moments here and there, but it's made for a selective set of audiences.

"Marcel the Shell with Shoes On","Feels like I'm the minority here. If you aren't feeling particularly soft headed this movie may try your patience. It is cute and quirky and at first clever, but goes on along the same line for far too long in the same tone, then attempts a little tear-jerking, only to resume the same steady, goofiness.

Synopsis:
Marcel is an adorable one-inch-tall shell who ekes out a colorful existence with his grandmother Connie and their pet lint, Alan. Once part of a sprawling community of shells, they now live alone as the sole survivors of a mysterious tragedy. But when a documentary filmmaker discovers them amongst the clutter of his Airbnb, the short film he posts online brings Marcel millions of passionate fans, as well as unprecedented dangers and a new hope at finding his long-lost family.

The movie summarized: Marcel putters around the house talking baby talk and doing cute little things like gathering food, having conversations with grown ups, sharing innocent interpretations of the world around him, is scared by dogs and squirrels, and is generally wondrous and wide-eyed about the world around him. This animated one-eyed shell is basically a baby that can talk.","9 September 2022",5,6,27
"Marcel the Shell with Shoes On","A charming mix media movie which combines animation and live action to tell it's tale of a tiny sea shell with a big eye, a magical mouth - and, yes, shoes on his tiny feet. MARCEL is an expansion of a series of three shorts by Dean Fleisher-Camp and Jenny Slate. Marcel (voiced by Slate) lives in a B&B and mostly stays out of sight of the visitors who pass through. That is, until an intrepid filmmaker (Fleischer-Camp playing a version of himself) makes friends with the shell and decides to document his life. As with the trio of shorts, Marcel's antics become an internet sensation. The shell's favorite TV show is 60 Minutes and it's not long before the film within a film's shorts catch the attention of that show's producers and its star Leslie Stahl (playing herself). Yes, it's that meta - and, not always to the movie's advantage.

Marcel lives in the home with his grandmother (touchingly voiced by Isabella Rossellini) and its their story and quiet interactions and observations on the ""larger"" world around them that do work extremely well. Carefully animated by the Chiodo Brothers (KILLER KLOWNS FROM OUTER SPACE) Fleischer-Camp and Slate create a unique and detailed environment for the mollusks to inhabit. At times, Dean (the character) is more of a distraction, although there are a few thoughtful gestures towards defining the role of a filmmaker with his subject. The self-referential internet fame material has its moments, but, again, it just as often detracts. Part of it, is inherent in trying to expand 4 minute shorts to feature length, but, the inherent sweetness of the movie wins out. And, there is no question that the innocence and spirit of Marcel is a winner as well.","11 October 2022",,0,1
"Marcel the Shell with Shoes On","The movie ""Marcel the Shell with Shoes On"" is a wonderful fable about observing life from a completely different perspective than what we are used to. Marcel is a very small mollusk, who refuses to hide inside his shell and instead finds clever ways to navigate his way through the house to find food, mobility, and protection. He lives only with his grandmother since an occupant leaves the house in a hurry taking his parents, siblings, and his entire community by mistake. An amateur filmmaker, Dean Fleischer-Camp himself, decided to rent the house thru Airbnb and ends up discovering Marcel, the shell with shoes on. Using his Youtube channel, Dean started posting videos of Marcel's daily activities. From there, both of them use the success of the media in a quest to find Marcel's relatives.

Director, actor and writer Dean Fleischer-Camp creates an allegory about family, friendship, loneliness, and that life, no matter how small, has its moments of encounters and farewell. The big star of the film is Jenny Slate as the voice of Marcel, she makes the character graceful, human, funny, smart, and with a lot of charisma.

""Marcel the Shell with Shoes On"" is a film that teaches, moves, makes you happy, and must be watched with a free and open spirit, without much expectation. Just let it delight you with the witty, smart, and wonderful script.","14 January 2023",9,0,0
"Marcel the Shell with Shoes On","I liked this one, a really fun cute little documentary-style movie about a shell (Jenny Slate) that can talk and expresses how he views the world.

"Marcel the Shell with Shoes On","Marcel the Shell with Shoes On is a quirky, light, feel good film about of a shell and his whimsical day to day life. The writing of this film is very simplistic, which suits its 'mockumentary' style.

That being said, with its filming style and simplistic writing, you might be in a certain mood or if you generally likes something more complex story you might not fully appreciate this film .

There's nothing groundbreaking story wise, but it's very witty, lots of light-hearted jokes, and sometimes poignant. And it mixes very well. It also has a lot of wisdom for such simple (in a good way) film. Some words that just you need to hear, somehow.

It's apparently an adaptation of a viral short film back in 2010.. and i honestly don't remember any of it. Probably because i don't live in US.","13 November 2022",8,0,0
"Marcel the Shell with Shoes On","""This, Is 90 Minutes""

What does it mean to be human? It's a question that we will likely explore as long as our species continues to exist. It is, perhaps, a quintessential part of being a human. We ask these questions and we explore possible answers in many ways. Writers write, painters paint, filmmakers, well, they make films. Writing and painting is, for the most part, a singular act, filmmaking, filmmaking is a communal effort. To say ""it takes a village"" is almost, almost an understatement. It starts (generally speaking) with the writer and is further developed by the director, who makes the film their own. The actors bring the words of the writer to life and the director helps them flesh out their roles. Behind the scenes are dozens (sometimes hundreds) of artists who contribute to the final film. According to imdb.com 131 people are credited with having worked on director Dean Fleischer-Camp's, MARCEL THE SHELL WITH SHOES ON. That's a lot of humans asking those eternal questions.

But Marcel, he may have some answers for us.

Originally an award winning short film, the first Marcel film was released in 2010, it was followed by, MARCEL THE SHELL WITH SHOES ON, TWO in 2011 and MARCEL THE SHELL WITH SHOES ON, THREE in 2014. All three can be viewed on YouTube, the ""fourth"" Marcel film is feature length and is playing in cinemas nation wide.

Marcel (Jenny Slate) lives with his grandmother, Nana Connie, brilliantly voiced by the great Isabella Rossellini. Marcel and Nana Connie are anthropomorphic shells, with shoes, and one googly eye. Marcel informs us early on that it takes at least twenty shells to have a proper community. And while there was once a thriving family and community, now it's just the two of them.

In what I can only see as commentary on the gun problem in our country, the shell community has a safe space for when the humans who live in their house fight. They all hide in the sock drawer. When a fight leads to the man leaving and quickly packing a bag, the contents of the sock drawer are unceremoniously dumped into the suitcase, Marcel and Nana Connie are left behind as they didn't make it to the drawer as quickly as the others. Nana is getting up there in years, and isn't as spry as she once was.

Turns out their house is an Airbnb, and currently staying there is filmmaker Dean (Dean Flesicher-Camp) who recently separated from his wife, Dean turns to making a documentary about Marcel to fill time while looking for a new place to live.

As we get to know Marcel and Nana Connie, we find out about their passion for the long running news show, ""60 Minutes,"" and in particular their absolute, adoration of Lesley Stahl. The community used to gather together every week to watch the show. As the film moves along, Dean posts clips of interviews with Marcel to the internet. And what starts as a handful of views turns into tens of millions of views. Of course this eventually leads to an email from a producer at ""60 Minutes"" telling Marcel that they'd like to do a story on him. Bet ya can't guess who's doing the interview! You probably figured out already that it's Lesley herself. Worried about what all the people and commotion would mean to Nana Connie's continually declining health, Marcel initially refuses the interview. Nana Connie and Dean persuade him to do otherwise.

To say anything about what happens next would spoil the journey.

Listen closely to what Marcel has to say, there's a lot to unpack. And those eternal questions? Turns out, for Marcel at least, that answer is community.

We could all learn a lot from Marcel.

That is all.","22 July 2022",10,3,8
"Marcel the Shell with Shoes On","Dean who has just discovered Marcel in the house he resides in, decides to film a documentary on the adorable Marcel with shell. He has a pet & lives with his grandmother Connie. The world he lives in is big for him. As his granny teaches all the tricks to him to survive without his mysteriously missing community including his parents, Marcel opens up to Dean on his life. The times when the couple who lived there before Dean, how colourful it was yet the current life doesn't deter Marcel who continues to stay cheerful. What actually happened to his community who vanished leaving behind just Marcel & Connie is the mystery to be solved.

It was a smart film indeed. Be it Marcel's favorite & how it is connected once Marcel gets famous. The social media influencers throwing themselves at Marcel, only to prove how that is not the support Marcel is seeking. Then there's Connie, such a beautiful relationship it is. The screenplay throws everything for everyone to connect with, the relatability factor, speaking in terms of ones connection to own family, leaves a stronger impact.

To put it even more simpler, this film made me happy.","11 November 2022",8,0,0
"Marcel the Shell with Shoes On","Very heartwarming movie. How Marcel and Nan improvise living in their surroundings as tiny mollusks is so imaginative and clever. Honey walking up the walls!

"Marcel the Shell with Shoes On","""Marcel the Shell"" is a deliriously charming and delightful film! I don't know how you could watch this and not just feel warm and fuzzy inside! It will heal your heart... it's just that pure and loveable! Marcel's world is small; and therefore the things he finds joy in are small - I have never seen a film more effectively portray finding the beauty in the little things in life! It's a film with such a pervasive sense of gratitude for the gift of life: for the gift of opportunities to change, progress and grow that we are so often presented with. It's a story about family and the necessity of the simple sharing of experiences with other people. It made me feel such a profound appreciation for life after watching... and that's one of the best feelings a movie could give me! I loved it for that! The story is simple, but finds so many ways to melt your heart. You will fall in love with Marcel, who is voiced with so much nuance by Jenny Slate! And the stop motion animation is seamless, all the motion is so smooth and realistic; Marcel fits right in with all the settings he is placed in! The film is beautifully shot too! This is a masterpiece of simplicity and creativity. It shows that even the smallest chew rafters and stories can still deliver big emotional impacts; this movie is poignant, profound, and heartwarmingly beautiful. I loved it, and highly recommend it! It will make you appreciate all the little things in life! It's a lovely little film!","5 October 2022",8,0,0
"Marcel the Shell with Shoes On","It's hard not to be moved by this film. This is life according to a little shell separated from his family, so it is an exploration into the things that connect us to our nearest and dearest. The execution of this film is adorable. Sit for a couple of minutes and you will be entranced by the alluring nature of the main character.

The character developement is very clever. The relationship between the main characters is what marks this as being quite an original piece of cinematic entertainment. You almost forget that it is stopmotion as you fall in love with Marcel.

Kudos to the team that put together this refreshing and poignant little visual and spiritual feast.","5 September 2022",9,1,2
"Marcel the Shell with Shoes On","Don't be giddy n ol' good vibes on me, it's just wasn't for me. This would not drop a single tear on anyone who had a hard life experienced before hand. It's too cliché for me. If I would change in the movie to make it really good. Turning point where Marcel told Dean to shut up. After that the story could've moved into another tier of unprecedented story line to another field of story telling. It's been repetitive between the interaction of Marcel and Dean in the movie. Back and forth repetitions of what's norm and whatnot. I really forced myself to like the movie. Set it up with my children's. Want to feed them with morale lesson that they could learn from the movie. Yes, every movie needs some sort of funding from the sponsors, visibly in action in the movie. But then again, it could've been more pleasing if it wasn't that a long movie to dragged.","4 September 2022",4,7,24
"Marcel the Shell with Shoes On","Until I saw MARCEL THE SHELL WITH SHOES ON, I had no idea that the character of Marcel had already been an Internet sensation for years. But as soon as I watched it, I knew why he had become so beloved. This charming, animated film follows the adventures of Marcel, a tiny shell with eyes and shoes-yes, shoes! - as he navigates his life at home with his grandmother Connie and their pet lint Alan (who is not a character but an object).

Marcel's world is a fascinating one. It's a combination of the familiar and the unknown, with glimpses into his shell ancestry and clues as to what happened to them all. The film also touches on themes like belonging, family, and identity-all while having fun with Marcel's small size and wonderful sense of adventure.

The animation is great, and I found myself mesmerised by the detail that went into every frame. The voice acting is top-notch, too, and I especially enjoyed Marcel's dry sense of humour. It's a fun and whimsical movie that is sure to delight both children and adults alike. Kids will love following Marcel on his adventures, while older viewers will appreciate the deeper themes of belonging and identity.","16 January 2023",7,0,0
"Marcel the Shell with Shoes On","Marcel the Shell with Shoes on follows Marcel, a Shell living with his grandmother after his family gets taken away. And through the help of a novice filmmaker named Dean, he gets all the help he needs to try and find them. Marcel himself falls in the same category that Paddington Bear does. Adorable, charming, and intriguing protagonists for film. Marcel just seems like a dumb Shell with a squeaky voice, but through the conflicts shown to him, he acts as if he's just a normal child going through these situations.

The conflict provides many ups and downs throughout the film as Marcel searches for his lost family, and enough feeling can be provoked throughout the story to make some cry.

Despite how negative the film's premise sounds, through the use of the main character, the side characters, and how they portray the world around them, Marcel can provide for any different group. It may be fun and funny for the kids in the audience, but it can provide teens and adults with messages that can change how they look at things and the people around them.","23 July 2022",10,2,7
"Marcel the Shell with Shoes On","Ok, I know everything is going woke, but seriously, one of the characters is a tampon. Tampon. The nonsensical, never ending stream of useless dialogue, wears you out very quickly. Silly little movie. Just plodding through this erratic film scene after scene.....what is the purpose? So you have a a tampon as a character? Was going to show this to my little neighbour because I thought the concept would be cute, but this would hold a child's attention for a nano second, which is just short of how long it could hold 4 adults' attention. We were struggling. Babble, babble and more silly babble. Little ugly shells all bouncing around, hoarding stuff from people and this, I think was supposed to be their ""cute"" little world.","6 September 2022",1,7,54

"Marcel the Shell with Shoes On","For reasons unbeknownst to me, this movie just works when it shouldn't. The character dynamic between Marcel and Dean feels earnest, even if you must suspending belief or create your own backstory - like nuclear radiation caused these inanimate objects to come to life. The documentary style of which the film plot is filmed and narrated make viewers feel like they're watching something genuine.

The life and story of Marcel is explained modestly well, even if his origins are omitted. The quick-witted dialogue brings lighthearted humor to the film. Through Marcel's adventure we see his range of emotion, from mortality to new life, but the sincerity never feels fully developed.

Other viewers spoke of crying or ritual experiences while watching this film, but I didn't find such relatability. And maybe that's ultimately the one fatal flaw of Marcel the Shell: Rather than focusing on just being a cute story of an adorable shell, it wants tries to bring too many humanistic qualities.","12 October 2022",7,0,0

"Marcel the Shell with Shoes On","You may walk into Marcel the Shell with Shoes On with an expectation it will be the viral youtube video phenomenon it was back in 2010, only bigger, and you'd be somewhat correct in that assumption, but not really. It really isn't that much bigger a version than what it was in the short clips they were on youtube, as Marcel has a montage of interactions with documentarian Dean Fleischer-Camp where Marcel shares his cute and often humorous thoughts and understandings about various things, in ways that are informal to traditional documentary film-making, as Marcel doesn't conceptualize what a documentary is, and expects a reciprocal relationship with the person filming his life, even getting into small arguments with Dean about why Dean hasn't thought to share very important details of his own life, and it's in these asides, as the humans going about their lives around Marcel, that its themes make themselves present. There's a point about 30 minutes into the movie in which Marcel gets into an argument with Dean after Marcel asks for some help relighting his candle after it accidentally gets blown out, and Dean futily attempts to explain to Marcel that that would defeat the purpose of the documentary, and Marcel has to show him how he would navigate that situation if Dean wasn't there, to which Marcel explains:

""There's just a lot of times where I don't get what I need...you are here that's the truth of it right now.""
""...that defeats the whole point of this.""
""Hey Dean, have you ever thought that your life might be a little less lonely and a bit more integrated if you actually took the time to connect with somebody instead of just making videos about them?""

A line that clearly cuts Dean deeply because in the very next frame, we see that Marcel's candle is lit. It's also the line that gets at the heart of Marcel's understanding of community and integration, as this is a movie in which humans live an atomized existence, where every human interaction takes place from behind cameras, where togetherness only exist in the form of romantic relationships that end, and are followed by total isolation until the next romantic relationship, and even the situation Marcel himself finds himself within, figuring out how to physically navigate the space that he's in entirely by himself with the challenges presented by his physical stature, separated from the community he lived with, is the direct result of a human relationship falling apart. And it's fitting this movie should take place in Los Angeles, the biggest city in the world purely in terms of land mass, which also happens to be the most atomized major city on earth, in which communal spaces are scant, public transportation is non existent, and everybody is expected to navigate their spaces individually.","12 September 2022",8,0,0

Rating: 8/10

Marcel is an adorable one-inch-tall shell who ekes out a colorful existence with his grandmother Connie. Once part of a sprawling community of shells, they now live alone as the sole survivors of a mysterious tragedy.

Marcel the Shell is a profound mockumentary that dives deeply into grief, loss, trauma, community, and friendship in a form of a lighthearted and kid-friendly atmosphere. I have never cried in a movie for quite some time now, but with Marcel, I have never been this moved since I saw Manchester By The Sea. Marcel the Shell is a very clever, funny, and heartwarming film, but at the same time, it does not manipulate your emotions. You will find yourself enjoying the conversation between Marcel, Dean, and Connie, but as they dive deeper into their everyday life, you discover their sense of longingness and grief.

Marcel the Shell is not a perfect film, it is flawed, but the film shines because of its sincerity and passion that translates on the big screen. What makes this film truly special is it came at a perfect time when people tend to forget the importance of relationships and community. It is cleverly written and with utmost sincerity from the writing and characters. As you finished the film, it will leave you feeling happier about life. The film is more than just a sweet and light-hearted Marcel, they were able to talk about grief and loss in a very poignant and profound way.

Marcel the Shell with Shoes On is a feel-good and ultimate mood-booster film, but as the movie progresses, you'll resonate more with the characters and the relationship that Marcel, Dean, and Connie have established. In these pandemic times, the film's themes of discovering connection and determining adventure will hit you to the core. Marcel the Shell is evidence that you can make a convincing film about anything, whether it could be a dog, a shell, or a rock---all you have to do is write a story with sincerity that people can relate to.

The whole film is well-balanced, well-grounded, and well-narrated, and it will change the trajectory of your life for the better. A wholesome film that kids and adults will enjoy.","30 October 2022",8,0,0

movie without having any reference to the original shorts, I was simply intrigued by the trailers that started popping up. What an absolute delight!

"Marcel the Shell with Shoes On","This movie was the most enjoyable thing I've watched in 2022. So heartwarming, cute, and genuinely funny that I teared up in the middle of a flight. Do you know how compelling a movie has to be for someone to do that?

It portrays the mundane experiences in life with a very enjoyable and quirky twist. The plot was touching and Marcel is written in a hilariously clever light.

The creativity of the storyline was probably the most enjoyable part of the perspective. A small creature in a big world, enjoying the same things we all do but in the most ingenious ways.

"Marcel the Shell with Shoes On","When I tell you everyone in the theatre was in tears by the end of this movie I am not fibbing in the slightest. I practically begged my friends to go see this movie with me for the reason that even the trailer made me tear up, little did they know that they would end up in tears as well. All good tears though, this movie is stunning, funny, quirky, and so many traits that just make it so worthwhile. It also has some really beautiful moments in it that I really appreciated, and this was a movie about a shell. Marcel is the most lovable main character ever with the silly cameraman as a great snap into reality that makes you feel like you are there with them. The movie is in sort of a documentary type style but where the camera man also has a role in the impact of the movie. I say watch it, it may seem like a little silly movie for kids but it actually covers some sad topics as well in a lovely and warming way. Heart warming film, I absolutely reccomend.","3 November 2022",10,0,0
"Marcel the Shell with Shoes On","I went into the movie as blind as possible, saw a single trailer and understood the premise of the movie was about Marcel, a one-inch-tall shell with shoes on in search of his family. An absurd and silly presentation only adds into the wholesomeness of the movie. I would say this movie is really great for someone experiencing a low or wanting something that will help remind them about certain things that make it all worthwhile.

I am a grown man in my 30s and I only managed to cry 4 times during this movie, maybe that's good idk, but it had so many areas where I wanted to stop and rewind, it's such an enjoyable film that flies by and shouldn't be discredited for its simple premise and silly presentation, these greatly add to the overall experience.","8 January 2023",9,0,0
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","I did not expect the sequel to a decent spin-off Dreamworks film from over a decade ago to be one of the most poignant, introspective, genuinely hilarious, and heartwarming films of the year. But here we are.

After an overly cheesy, somewhat clunky opening sequence, The Last Wish very quickly begins developing its zany assortment of characters into distinct quirky personalities with sympathetic desires and clear goals. The film juggles several character arcs and it's almost miraculous how it successfully handled all of them with proper set up and satisfying, emotionally weighty payoffs.

The screenplay is wacky, witty, and also bursting with heart as it deals with weighty themes of trusting others and finding purpose in any circumstances. And it tackles these themes in ways that are always understandable to all ages but never insultingly oversimplified.

What I also didn't expect was that the action sequences would be so well-choreographed and beautifully animated, and that the movie would often be terrifying and violent at times.

I adored this film. I think it's Dreamworks' best film since Megamind and it's easily the best true family film of the year.","22 December 2022",10,272,285
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","""Puss in Boots: The Last Wish"" is as spry and light on its feet as its titular feline. The inherently alluring paradox of the swashbuckling kitty from the ""Shrek"" universe remains firmly in place 11 years after his first solo feature. He's a dashing adventurer, a charmer with the ladies, feared and renowned throughout the land -- but he's also unbearably adorable as he laps up milk from a shot glass with his pinky, sandpapery tongue. As always, the charismatic and sensitive Antonio Banderas finds just the right tone in exploring this furry animated figure's suave and silly sides. ""The Last Wish"" expands the roster of ridiculously talented supporting players from the Oscar-nominated 2011 original ""Puss in Boots."" Joining Banderas and his longtime friend and co-star Salma Hayek Pinault are Florence Pugh, Olivia Colman, Ray Winstone, Da'Vine Joy Randolph, and John Mulaney, among many others. They bring a surprising amount of substance to what might have been a purely playful endeavor. But of course, the fast-paced humor and elaborate visuals are the main draws of director Joel Crawford and co-director Januel Mercado's film. The film's aesthetics may rely too heavily on anime influences, especially during the action sequences, but the vibrant colors and rich textures are a delight. From the moss growing on a fearsome forest giant to the shiny silkiness of Puss' whiskers blowing in the wind, ""The Last Wish"" offers a variety of eye-popping details. And it frequently features dramatic shadows and subtle dissolves to transition from past to present or one scene to the next. But the film also manages to convey messages of selflessness and teamwork in a way that doesn't feel heavy-handed or cloying. And the stellar voice performances and dazzling visuals keep things so engaging you won't need a laser pointer or a catnip-stuffed mouse toy to entertain you.","22 December 2022",10,145,160
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","Puss and Boots the last wish is a fantastic sequel and inarguably better than the charming first outing. The animation is brilliant, characters are charming, pacing is tight, very funny and the action is excellent. Not to mention there is a ton of heart. If I were to nitpick I think one of the antagonists trumps the other. One is played for more comedic purposes while the other is an Intimidating physical presence for boots to contend with. The Last Wish has something for everyone and it's probably one of the better animated movies I've seen in sometime. I really don't want to get into the story to avoid spoilers because the movie was a lot of fun, and it's best to go into it fresh. If anyone is considering taking their family to see the Last Wish like I did then The Last Wish is an easy recommendation. 100% worth the money. Two thumbs up for team friendship.","23 December 2022",9,123,133
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","I did not have many expectations going into this with my daughter, I've seen the main Shrek movies but noon of the other Puss in Boot's spin-offs. I was shocked at how good a movie this was when the credits rolled!

The story itself is functional, but all characters are given meaningful and relatable arcs. Between the melanchonic Puss reaching the end of his days as a great hero, his always positive dog sidekick and the 3 antagonistic parties trying to reach the magical macguffin there is a lot going on and none of it feels forced in.

The two greatest assets the movie brings is it's humor and the stunning action scenes. First of all, this movie has bite, it is back to the tone of the first Shrek movie with lots of jokes that are working on a children and adult level of understanding. While the story is easy to follow for kids, the themes explored are relatively mature and will keep adults engaged.

Secondly, while Disney/Pixar movies lately fail to make action exiting with their polished CGI style, Puss in boots goes full Into the Spiderverse once a fight breaks out. Glorious 12 frames per second, hyper stylized with all the filters and gimmicks necessary to elevate the big set-pieces to something truly special and memorable. Especially Puss's duels against a mysterious bounty hunter are the highlights.

While not entirely original, the Puss in Boots: The Last Wish combines the edgy humor of Shrek with the visual wonders of Into the Spiderverse and strings it along a relatively matured heroes journey coming to it's end tale that is closer to Logan than any other animation I can think off. Oh and just in case (not that I personally care much about it) there is zero political agenda to be found here to be a distraction of the perception.","7 December 2022",9,148,161
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","This is genuinely one of my favorite films of the year. I hope it gets real recognition and people don't dismiss it as ""just an animated film"".

I've always liked DreamWorks films, with my favorite being How to Train Your Dragon 2, but after rewatching the first Puss in Boots movie, I wasn't expecting much for this sequel, eleven years after. I like the first installment for sure but it's certainly a lot simpler in story than I'd prefer. This one however, has such a rich emotional aspect to it that I truly felt something during it.

There were also certain scenes involving a wolf character that were quite creepy. I think kids will have a lot of fun with this movie, but at the core this is a story about family and understanding the value of things and/or people who are in front of you already. And that's a message that every person of any age can get something out of. The voice acting is top-notch and the animation is such a ridiculous step-up from the last time. This is such a cool direction to take this sequel into and I dug it all the way through.

There's really not much negative to say other than the ending feels like it should have been slightly more concise, but that's it. I loved it and I'll rewatch it as soon as it releases on VOD.","13 December 2022",8,70,80
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","I genuinely cannot believe I'm saying this, but this is one of the best movies of the year, so far, it's neck to neck with The Menu for me.

Incredible on every front.

The animation is incredible. I'm beyond thrilled that Dreamworks decided to ditch the hyper-realistic animation style, and just went for a style that would perfectly represent the emotions and craziness that this movie needed.

The characters, EVERY SINGLE ONE, was so fleshed out, and they all felt like they had a purpose being there. We didn't get the usual Shrek style, Grimm fairytale cameos for no reason, on the contrary, they all played an important role in the story, and in the overall message.

This movie also had me so emotional, no spoilers, but it's the way the creators handle their characters, with such sincerity and heart.

Finally, the action, and the plot itself, it was go go go from the get go, i haven't seen a more well paced film all year, i think that is my favourite part of the dilm (Avatar 2 could take some notes)

Overall, it was truly such a blast, so fun, heartfelt, FUNNY, genuine, with a great message at its core.","18 December 2022",10,163,183
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","FYI, surprisingly, kids understood jokes aimed at adults. Yes, there are spots of the movies where it's hard to know what they understand because ideas aim at us adults. But, I think the kids still understood it enjoyed the deeper parts.

Personally, the movie was very fitting. Like Puss, I'm also trying to find out who I am and who I want to be in life. This was our journey.

The stories have great connections romantically, between rivals and newcomers. The stories are about bringing all of us together despite what happened in the past. The stories come together about building a better future for ALL OF US. Let go of selfish wants and desires, focus on OTHERS and let's work together for a better future!","24 December 2022",9,40,49
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","LIKES:

Pacing
-Very good for kids and adults with short attention spans
-Jumps in and establishes the world quickly so that the adventure can start right off and get us into the goods.

-Surprisingly, still establishes story and does a great job of giving the character's the development they need, well mostly
-Is an adventurous pace that really strings along and has excitement, establishing the edge.

-Fun overall and jams a lot in a short amount of time.

Adorable Characters/Feel
-New characters are adorable, these iconic groups expanded to the next model characters we all want
-Fantastic use of design and voice acting to help further establish gimmicks that kids will be quoting for years to come.

-The feel of the movie is indeed adorable, and as the character's continue to evolve that adorable feel comes out even more and wraps so many things up in the nice bow.

-Has that element of Shrek that is touching and full of that charm that adds the adorable nature.

The Animation
-It's gorgeous at times and still runs smooth, with that attention to anatomy DreamWorks does so well.

-The design still mimics the blend of real and fairytale, blending the best of both worlds that we have fallen in love with this series.

-The world building is very fun, again familiar trends and architecture, but the spin of things shows the creativity that they can always do that I certainly enjoy with their adult twists to the nursery rhymes.

-And it tries new things with the style that sort of work.

-Overall , still top notch and better in some aspects than Disney for the blend of real and cartoons.

The Voice Acting:
-Many characters are brought to life by the voice more than the animation, as the personalities ooze out of the characters.

-Mulaney is hilarious and makes the lines come out with that SNL like delivery that is snarky, well-timed, and enunciated. He own the Horner character and brought some of the best lines.

-Wagner Moura is so bone-chilling in his role as the Big-Bad Wolf, and he really is a prime choice for a bad guy to really get that sinister side going.

-Though consistency does not make sense, the three bears are charming in their own sense the farther you get in.

-Pugh is okay, not my favorite role as Goldi, but certainly there is spark there and what she does throw in is very good for the headstrong leader. Note, the accent is a bit forced, but impressed how she makes it work.

-Guillen is the dog, and his enunciation and direction with the cute puppy Is charming and the most adorable thing of the movie. It does start out annoying, but he evolves the energy quite well.

-Hayek's reprisal is just fine as always, sassy, calm, but emotional when the time comes and balances things out that really help establish the rival aspect of the cat in shoes.

-Banderas takes Boots and reprises the comedy and spirit well with the passion of the Spanish stereotype. And yet, he once again adds elements to him and takes the new emotions that are presented quite well, establishing the growth of the character with the visuals.

The References/Jokes
-The stories people remember are back and starting to really become known and connect to the humor of Shrek.

-It's dark, twisted, and very well timed at many parts, somehow being relevant, but still fun as it moves with the stories.

-The fact the humor is part of the character and not so extremely forced for the most part, again fantastic strategy.

-It feels like the first two Shrek's and is a part of it rather than the whole thing. Again, refreshing that they were able to step back.

The Designs Changes To An Extent
-Creative and references to several styles that are cool to see.

-Like Into the Spiderverse? Good, because it feels partly like that when they issue this style, helping to emphasize the manner of storytelling that Puss does.

-Not overused, which is very good for me.

The Action At Times
-Shrek is never an action film, but there is a charm and element to it that makes it fun to watch.

-This movie does have those moments, having the comedic fun to make things goofy, but also has some circumstances that mix things up and make it fun.

-The ending fight shows the potential of what DreamWorks can do when you put the focus and time in, making for one of the better fight scenes I've seen this year.

The Heart
-Lots of good character moments that really teach you the lessons of the movie.

-The movie is a relevant look at the aspects of life and the things we mortals dream of.

-There are lessons in every character, good or bad, that somehow mix very well and sink in because of the natural feel of the story. That's hard to do in many things.

-I love the cuteness and how that somehow softens the heart to help things sink in and connect with them and that helps again sell the feel of the movie.

-Have not felt this way since Shrek 2.

DISLIKES:

The Darkness
-It's a necessary element of the story, but at times goes a tad too dark that you may not want young ones exposed to.

-Caution with kids, as there is plenty of nightmare fuel for them to see and you need to be cautious.

-Might be a tad too sinister at times, and though humorous, again caution with who you might take to see this film, as the lessons might be a bit foreboding and depressing.

Predictable
-The lines of the dialog are too laden with foreshadowing to not guess the ending.

-The movie's trailers ruined a lot of things and if you remember that can lead to knowing what's coming, which this movie did a little too much and thus ruined the surprise element.

-Kind of hard not to guess this from so many other elements to know how this movie is going to end, but if you can turn your memory and clues off, it doesn't' matter.

Too Many Antagonists
-One of my biggest complaints is too many antagonists and not enough time to explore them all
-They do tie things up enough that everyone is worth it, but it just doesn't sell them perfectly when you have three sets of baddies and try to make them vie for superiority.

-Need one less antagonist that might have made for better cat and mouse games, action, and overall plot development that could have made this an even better movie.

-Several character just seem extra and again, did not need all of them in this one movie given the way it ends.

The Comedy Is Still Tapered
-It's starting to go back to Shrek, but it's not quite there yet for me.

-Still a little tapered to the know and kiddy, alongside the fact that it gets lost in banter and running jokes that things sort of peter out.

-Where was the witty retorts and the euphemisms that made Shrek, Shrek.

-They took better steps toward the movie though, and there is foundation to build from in the future should more be made.

The Animation Changes At Times
-The animation changes are almost always during the fight scenes, and though tapered in amount rob the movie of something.

-The comic book feel is cool, but why could we not have more fluid finishes and make it feel like the Spiderman movie style to make the gamble fully worth the experimentation with?

-Just felt like add on and would have liked to stay in the lanes or again maximize the use of this style.

The Action Still Not Complete
--Shrek and Shrek 2 have the action scenes for this series that are my most enjoyable moments.

-This movie has those elements that again brush the quality, but they just don't have the same chemistry and choreography to match that level.

-The stakes are starting to return, but fizzle out or are sort of just dragged than elevated.

-They sometimes go too silly and return to the level of movies three and four, that are enjoyable, but still not balanced or worth the fight.

-Often was shorter than I wanted it to be and the fights just didn't connect as well or utilize all the tools that again the predecessors did. Chaotic and haphazard use is funny, but chaos does lead to sloppy action scenes.

The VERDICT
I must say, Puss In Boots: The Last Wish was a much better film than when I walked in. Perhaps it's due to my negative mindset going in, but the movie really does start stepping back to the Shrek roots that pulled me into the series in the first place. Animation is solid and a bit diverse, with acting and direction to help pull the feelings into the character development occurring. It evolves the cat's tale and puts the engaging atmosphere in, with plenty of adorable and heartfelt characters to play in. And it has great voice acting that delivers solid comedy at times and makes for the wild ride that they were making and it does work. This film is indeed a solid return to the world and I had a lot of fun in theater appreciating all the design elements this movie holds. However, the movie is on the right track but has not quite reached the goal and there are still elements that need to continue to rework to get the full magic. Balance is the key really, as the darkness is a little much and the predictability offsetting some of the balance I was looking for. The movie has too many bad guys trying to balance between things that are complete, but not fully realized with Puss In Boots' story and one less might have been a good direction for me personally. And the action and comedy are again hinting at how good things can be, but again is not hitting it out of the park for me and still can return to the quality of the Shrek that we saw in the first two movies. Still, I do recommend giving this movie a shot, but be warned about the darkness to watch out for and be cautious with the kiddos who are sensitive to these things.","22 December 2022",8,42,62
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","Puss in Boots: The Last Wish provides a fun adventure with meaningful lessons and tons of vibrant action. Donde está la Leche?

The first 30 minutes of the movie are filled with your typical Puss as he sings, dances, and fights with his ever-so-charismatic yet cocky personality. He is quickly humbled when he finds out he needs to be more careful with his life, and this is where I was instantly hooked.

Then enters the big bad wolf, from the wolf's menacing character design, skin trembling voice to the life-threatening fighting style. Wolf was one of the fantastic antagonists. I questioned whether this would be too much for the younger audience because the wolf's scenes struck fear in our beloved Puss. Although, as a viewer, we know nothing serious will happen, I felt this was a strong enough case for the plot.

It didn't end there; we are introduced to various fairytale Characters. I am not going to spoil too much.

Overall, the movie is fast-paced, has adult humor, and represents a love story, greed, and the beauty of friendship.

Verdict: Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is a fun time for the family; I would suggest watching it if you have younger ones. Even if you don't have younger ones and are a fan of the Shrek universe, it's worth the watch. Shoutout to Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayek for there wonderful performances!","12 December 2022",9,27,37
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","Poor old Puss has used up eight of his nine lives, now he's a shadow of the cat, that used to thrive, he's residing in a home, no more to dance, to fight, to roam, all the things he so enjoyed, he's now deprived. But Goldilocks, and her three bears, need Puss's claws, to get a map, that's clasped in Jack Horner's big paws, that will lead them to a star, on a journey wide and far, and a wish that gives them everything and more.

And thus follows an enchanting adventure of discovery and realisation, of avarice and excess, of friendship and family and love. Great animation, perfectly delivered dialogue and a universal message relatable to all.","7 January 2023",8,22,32
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","A delightful animated film that offers fast-paced humor, elaborate visuals, and strong voice acting from a talented cast. Antonio Banderas once again brings charm and depth to the titular character, and Harvey Guillen steals the show as the sweet and enthusiastic Perrito. The dynamic between Puss, Perrito, and Kitty Softpaws (voiced by Salma Hayek Pinault) is engaging and adds substance to what could have been a purely playful endeavor. The film's anime-influenced action sequences are visually striking, and the use of dramatic shadows and subtle dissolves helps to smoothly transition between scenes. Overall, ""Puss in Boots: The Last Wish"" is a fun and visually appealing adventure that is sure to entertain audiences of all ages.","22 December 2022",8,28,38
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","Alright I know what you're thinking after seeing the score of this review. ""Sequels to spin-offs of beloved franchises are pointless exercises in brand awareness! Why on earth are you giving this one a 10?!?""

Because this movie...is DIFFERENT than the others. Different in that it strives to be a funnier, deeper, prettier, bolder, edgier, (surprisingly) scarier and overall more complete experience than the original Puss in Boots film over 11 years ago, and unlike that movie holds a distinct accomplishment in simply being a darn fine animated film that stands on its own, one as good as any I've seen in the past few years.

The Shrekiverse is officially back, and judging by what DreamWorks managed to pull off here the world probably isn't ready for whatever comes next. Seriously, this gives the first two films in the franchise alone a run for their money.

Looks like The House That Shrek Built is finally back on top again.

PS: That cricket with the spot-on Jimmy Stewart voice is one of the funniest things I've seen this year, whoever came up with him deserves a pay raise and a medal and free coffee and recognition from the United Nations.","21 December 2022",10,35,47
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","Wow ! Dreamsworks has always been good with sequels and I think it is safe to say this might be their best sequel to date .

Without giving much of the plot there are many new characters and fairy tales introduced here and they actually help elevate the story alongside with being so cute ,loveable and hilarious .

Appealing to both kids and adults ,this movie was a treat ,it mixes being a fun continuation to the story without repeating the same tropes of the first movie and also handles heavy topics without feeling grim ,dark or taking itself too seriously.

Highly recommended and worth every penny 👌","15 December 2022",10,54,67
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","You heard me! My wife and I just got back from the theater, and absolutely LOVED this movie, even more than any of the Shrek movies and the first Puss in Boots!

This movie has SO MUCH to love, from BEAUTIFUL visuals/action to consistent humor that actually had us laughing to engaging characters, both old and new. Such a fun time, and so worth seeing in the theaters, though we'll definitely be picking up a copy once it's out on DVD!

Without giving too much away, there are several different antagonists in this movie that scratch all the bad-guy itches, covering the spectrum from totally hateable to horrifying to relatable and sympathetic. A great cast! Also, the magical world they came up with for this movie was awesome, with some really cool/unique features!

At first, we were a little worried about the dog character, neither of us being big fans of daffy sidekicks, but we were pleasantly surprised to find ourselves rooting for him! He's hilarious, and that's coming from a cat-lover!

Several callbacks to the first Puss in Boots movie made this one feel less like a spin-off than a worthy standalone franchise, and the movie was PACKED with magical references that all ages will be able to recognize and enjoy.

Do yourself a favor and free a few hours for this one!! A rare 10 from me!!","21 December 2022",10,31,43
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","It is beyond crazy how good this movie was. The character development was so very well-done, Puss experiencing fear for the first time, and his fear of mortality was so palpable, well, reasoned and relatable.

Death's characterizations was on point, his motivation made complete sense, and he was really horrifying, I totally understood why Puss was so afraid of him.

The side characters were all likeable. The dog was a delight, and the bear family's arc was genuinely touching with several emotional moments.

They also landed the ending, and the final shot not only gave me major Pirates Of The Carribbean vibes, it also gave me so much hope for what's to come. I would be happy if they made another installment.","17 December 2022",10,22,33
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","Is a large understatement when reviewing ''puss in boots 2'', because this was a marvel of animation techniques, a pepperspray full of rainbowlike colours from start to end, and a story that accelerate from a dim start of reminisence into a progressive eroticlike cataclysm of sound and vivid visioned story that engulfed most of the tom and jerry language spheres children fairytail caracters in its well filled bossom of fanatic fantastic fantasia of animation. Include the voice acts, the musical score and the insanely well done job made by the colourasation crew, this will stimulate your medula oblongata into a feverish climax that youll dwell over for a long time.

The gibberish grumpy old man saw this 3 times on our last family night after x-mas holiday season, with my wife and each of my adult children, and the jury said...perfect... bravissimo, maybe a dacapo in 20 years, just to forget the caracters again as the years fade by.","10 January 2023",10,6,9
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","After experiencing it on the big screen, I can say without a doubt that this movie crushes any and all other movies released this year, with the exception of the bad guys of course. This movie showed me that there is still hope in animation and DreamWorks in general, it's an experience waiting to happen, don't miss out! For you will definitely want to see this movie, the characters, the animation, the art style, and of course the story was truly remarkable! Even most of the jokes are good. Please if you are still considering it, watch this movie! It's a must watch, you and your friends will enjoy it.","22 December 2022",10,20,29
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","It may seem like Puss in Boots: The Last Wish pointless ridiculous film on the surface ..... but there is a lot to like about this animated DreamWorks film; the movie delivers on several levels making it worth your time seeking out . I am praising the overall aesthetic. The animation is more advanced, the movie looked like it was a fairy tale painting. Takes advantage of modern CG technologies lovingly paired with more traditional 2D techniques. In the opening, the film uses more hand-drawn techniques like your yesteryear cartoons . And as it progresses the technique harnessed new advancements in CG technology to reintroduce this fairy tale world in new and refreshing way.....It is quite the spectacle to witness and in 3D to boot !!! Not the Same Old CG. In the animation, they actually took off motion blur so that it frames stutters . I have actually never seen animation technique like this before ! Really made this fantastical hybrid.

Puss in Boots: The Last Wish Mashed up a Spaghetti Western with a fairy tale, so you get those beautiful Western compositions and staging opportunities, but then you get these fantastical locations born out of your imagination.

Puss in Boots discovers that his passion for adventure has taken its toll: he has burnt through eight of his nine lives. Puss sets out on an epic journey to find the mythical Last Wish and restore his nine lives.

And the movie is all brought to life with a cast full of Oscar nominated and winner actors; It makes all the sense in the world when you've got an entire universe populated by iconic fairy tale characters like Goldilocks (Florence Pugh), the Three Bears (Olivia Colman, Ray Winstone, and Samson Kayo), the Big Bad Wolf (Wagner Moura), Little Jack Horner (John Mulaney), and even Puss himself (Antonio Banderas).

This is a ""must-see"" for all. There are so many takeaways. This movie kept me wanting more. It was great to see all the fairy tale characters in play wanting something they already possessed, needing to appreciate the moment--learning to be mindful of what we already have around us everyday. It's equal parts exciting and hilarious as well as earnest. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish mixes stunning animation with a poignant, surprisingly mature story . 8/10.","26 December 2022",8,10,17
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","I can't believe how much I loved this movie, the animation, the script, the characters, the story, even the music, everything about this film is Oscar worthy. Yes, it's really that good. It's hard to believe this is a sequel to a spin-off from a franchise that already had so many movies, this film blows all of them out of the water. Yes, this movie is better than Shrek, just do yourself a favor and watch the film in theaters while it lasts, you will not regret seeing this style of animation on the big screen. My only complaint is John Mulaney was sort of distracting as a voice, I couldn't focus on the character because of the voice.","23 December 2022",10,29,35
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","I have seen good movies in the year of 2022, but Puss in Boots: The Last Wish (2022) is by far the best animated movie of 2022 and is my favorite movie from that year. Also, it is the best movie in the Shrek franchise.

The voice cast is great; Antonio Banderas as Puss in Boots was great, Salma Hayek was great, and Harvey Guillén as Perrito was great because they are good characters, and they are funny. Florence Pugh as Goldilocks, Olivia Colman as Mama Bear, Ray Winstone as Papa Bear, and Samson Kayo as Baby Bear were funny, and they were also good characters.

There is this wolf villain in the movie that is legit creepy, was such a cool character. He does certain things that makes him a great villain for Puss in Boots to go against, and he is voiced by Wagner Moura who has a great voice for this character.

The animation is beautiful in this movie; it has amazing action scenes, pretty scenery, and imaginable locations that look great in this animation style. The movie is also creative in how it uses fairytale locations and items from those stories, which is what makes another villain character voiced by John Mulaney funny to watch.

The movie has a simple plot but does it in a creative way with great characters, and some little references to Shrek. What I especially loved was how Puss in Boots starts laughing in the face of danger, but because he is on his last life, he starts getting scared and starts thinking about what he has done with his earlier lives and how spent them.

I had a fun time with Puss in Boots: The Last Wish (2022); it has fantastic animation, it was funny, it has great characters, it has great emotional moments, and there are great action scenes. I highly recommend checking this movie out because you will have gun with it, and I am excited to see this movie again when I get the chance.","8 January 2023",10,5,7
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","Animation movies usually are comedic and does not treat itself seriously. However, this move surprised me. It gave the characters a story and took it to the next level. Puss and Boots has used up 8 of his 9 lives. The Wolf who looks like death is truly a terrifying character that made Puss and Boots really scared of Death. I love everything in this movie. Goldilocks is looking for a family, Kitty Softpaws looking for true love, Perro is looking for friends, and Jack Horner is looking for power.

The animation style is very well done and looks absolutely stunning. I love this movie and I would watch it again and again. What a great way to end 2022.","25 December 2022",10,7,11
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","This has caused quite a stir in recent days, and it's it safe to say that it eventually caught my interest. Speaking for myself, I knew nothing about Puss because I had never seen a single movie in the 'Shrek' lineup, which sparked my curiosity even more.

To prep for this allegedly wonderful sequel, I had to finish the first film first, which I did. I saw the first Puss in Boots movie this morning, but to my utter disappointment, it did not meet my expectations, and uncertainty worked its way in. I was worried about whether the sequel would live up to the hype.

And I am pleased to report that it did. 'The Last Wish' may not be among the best films I have ever seen, but it is an interesting and enjoyable watch for sure.

The visuals are absolutely gorgeous, the blend of two distinct animation art styles makes for an interesting cinematic experience, the score, too, sprinkled its fair share of magic, and on top of that, the characters are more fleshed out, unlike the last time, and the inclusion of 'Perrito' and 'Death' brought radical changes to the narrative, their mere presence made this more exciting.","12 January 2023",8,4,6
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","""Like Kung fu Panda (2)"" this film is gorgeous and has phenomenal fight choreography. The animation is colorful and each character has a specific movement.

There aren't any* characters I dislike in this movie. The writing has a the same cynical and irreverent style of the first 2 Shrek's but it has an almost Disney like genuineness. The characters in this movie don't trust each other, but even they all* have hearts.

I think the movie has 4 acts and the time between act 1 and 2 are a little slow, but overall it has fantastic pacing.

Other than ""Into Spider-verse"" and ""The Lego Movie"", there isn't a better family movie in the last decade. In the last 2 decades I think I prefer ""How to Train Your Dragon"" and a handful of Pixar's best I can't think of.","6 January 2023",9,7,10
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","""Puss in Boots: The Last Wish"" is a film whose animation is excellent, full of colorful and detailed scenes, but its script becomes tired in some scenes and even predictable, although its positive message on issues of personal relationships stands out. The characters are fun, highlighting Goldilocks and the three bears. Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayek manage to entertain by lending their voices to the protagonists. Puss in Boots is a fun character but his story lacks more irreverence like in ""Shrek"". The soundtrack perfectly recreates the essence of a fairy tale. ""Puss in Boots: The Last Wish"" is a visual delight with a passable script that could have been better.","12 December 2022",7,12,25
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","""Puss in Boots: The Last Wish"" is a fun adventure in the ""Shrek"" universe! I gotta admit I have not seen the original film, and don't cherish the ""Shrek"" films as much as many do... so I went into this with mild expectations. And honestly, I had a good time; it was cute! Do I think it was as good as many other reviewers have suggested? No. But it was enjoyable, lighthearted fun that is perfect for families with kids! The voice cast was awesome, especially John Mulaney and Florence Pugh as the villains, Jack Horner and Goldilocks respectively. And of course Antonio Banderas as Puss in Boots is iconic as ever!

The animation here was gorgeous too, honestly it was one of my favourite parts. I love that major studio animated movies are finally starting to take more risks with their animation style, moving away from the typical 3D CGI realism. You gotta respect ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" for starting this trend and showing that different styles can work! I loved that this had a more watercolor, storybook illustration look to it, it really worked for the story and was employed in such creative ways! I would love to see the ""Shrek"" movies take this on, but alas they seem to have established their own look. This movie just looked so cool, so distinct in its own style, it really felt like I was watching a story in a fairy tale world.

Now, of course I have to admit I didn't love this movie. Something about it felt off to me, I couldn't seem to see where the acclaim was coming from. Sure, it was fun, it was cute, and I enjoyed myself while watching, but I never felt like I truly connected with the film. The opening scene felt a little jumbled to me, rapidly going from a musical sequence, to comedy for kids, to an action scene and I wished it would've let me settle into the story a bit first. I get this is a movie primarily for kids, but with most animation they tend to make parts enjoyable for the parents and older audiences as well. I don't really feel that here - they tried with the themes and the deeper storyline - but it never actually worked in my eyes. Everything felt very kid-focused, which isn't a bad thing, it just meant I wasn't the core audience and so it makes sense why I wouldn't enjoy it as much. I have to say, the kids in my theatre seemed to be having a blast! I'm sure this is a great movie for families with children, it just wasn't as good as I was told it would be.

I think the movie tried to do a bit of what Pixar is known for, the whole ""trying to be deep"" thing. The movie involves Puss in Boots coming to terms with death, and it seemed to be somewhat shallow, it never truly dove into this aspect of the story. Instead, the storyline is very linear and somewhat dull where it is just about the characters traveling to their destination and the villains sometimes catching up and then combat ensuing. And the physical goal literally being the spiritual goal just makes the inevitable plot point of ""maybe I don't need the thing I wanted all long and it's the friends I made along the way that count"" seem all the more predictable. Even Puss' relationship with the side characters is unchallenging. Although he is deeply flawed, his companions never seem to care about that and forgive him all the time. The chemistry of the characters was just nowhere as endearing as in ""Shrek"". Still the adventure was quite fun, I just didn't think the themes clicked as it felt like they were trying to be deep in a way that is not as organic and surprising as a film like Pixar's ""Up"", ""Finding Nemo"" or even DreamWorks' ""How to Train Your Dragon"".

Perhaps I am being too harsh, I feel like this review is sounding more negative than anything. I really did have fun with it, and overall would give it a thumbs up, it's an enjoyable way to spend an hour and a half. The animation was really cool, the voice cast was great, and man I loved the little nods to the ""Shrek"" movies even if I was never a huge fan of those. If nothing else, this movie did make me really hopeful for another ""Shrek"" film. I do enjoy this fairy tale world and the creative animation they used to tell the story!","28 December 2022",7,8,14
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is the sixth entry in the Shrek franchise and a sequel to the spinoff film from over a decade ago. All the writings on the wall screamed cash grab and milking a franchise. Yet somehow this movie ended up being an absolute blast to watch!

The animation is stylistic, vibrant and gorgeous with animation that is inspired by the Spiderverse movies. Every frame is whacky and creative! The story is also wonderfully done despite the short runtime. It gives a very poignant and meaningful message to the audience. What surprised me the most though was the action scenes! Dreamwork didn't need to go that hard but wow those action scenes are choreographed so well!

I don't like milking a franchise for over 20 years but this film gives me slight hope that the next entry might be worth watching.","14 January 2023",9,4,6
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","Let's start by saying that this movie is the sequel to a spin-off. Originality, there is no. But make no mistake, this review will be the polar opposite of the previous one, and it's all because this movie has vast improvements in every aspect. Fasten your seatbelts, we're going to the land of comparisons!

The general aesthetic has been completely revamped and changed to separate itself from the saga that was born. Other than the characters (and something in the end), there's nothing here that comes close to Shrek or the first Puss in Boots movie. What there are are layers and layers of colorful landscapes, anime movements, well-grounded humor, absurd humor, children's humor and even for each character there is a lesson behind it, don't forget that after all, this is a fairy tale.

The really great thing about this film is that it's a multi-layered work, which makes it suitable for all audiences. However, the most salvageable is the lesson that remains for the film industry itself: It doesn't matter to wait more than ten years to make a sequel, as long as it's well done. Let's forget about the hamburger factory. This should always be so.

Separate point, did you notice the movie references? There are many, but my favorites are two: one of James Cameron's movies and another one of the most popular movie of just last year.

Get ready because this will be the new animation style from now on.","11 January 2023",8,3,4
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","Stunning animation, heartfelt story, beautiful music and most importantly, there was true passion. You can really tell someone wanted to make this movie.

The fun moments were heartwarming, the scary moments were truly suspenseful and the action was incredibly fluid.

There are some negatives, mainly regarding the villians, but they are very minor compared to the overwhelming positives.

The main message of the movie is as beautiful as the animation, you have one life, don't spend it doing frivolous things, find people you can love and trust, embrace them with all you got, because death comes for us all one day and you don't want to face it alone.

Just watch this movie.","24 December 2022",10,9,13
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","I've been hearing a lot of good things about this movie all month long. Before I knew it, I was really anticipating this movie. And I have to say that it has mostly met my expectations. This is a damn good movie.

This movie reminds me of an old fashioned animated adventure. With different characters competing to complete a quest, almost like a treasure hunt. And it's really really entertaining. The soundtrack is so good. The animation is gorgeous. It was something similar to hand drawn animation during the action sequences and that surprisingly made it really cool. The direction is also really cool, especially how portrayed Puss's character and the Villain's.

I won't deny that the story, and the messages are pretty much predictable. But this is one of those movies that even if you know, what's going to happen, it's still very exciting when it happens. My theatre had such an unenthusiastic crowd this time because trust me, there are some crowd-cheering sequences towards the end.

Now let's talk about the characters, which I think is the core of this movie. Puss is a likeable character, if you've seen the 1st movie you'd already know that. But this time we see some different sides of him and actually saw his vulnerable version. That made him a great protagonist worth rooting for. The side characters and the side-villains are really entertaining as well, and I loved the direction they took with some of them. They don't overdo a certain type of humour and spread out all these different types of characters throughout the movie, which was clever.

And now THE VILLAIN. Easily one of the coolest villains I've seen in a while. Whenever, he even made an appearance, I got goosebumps. And the animation and direction is just amazing with his scenes.

I also really liked how deep they took Puss's character arc, looking back at how he has lived up till now and what it actually means to be brave. And the villain actually played an integral part in that.

In the end, this is a great movie, and I'd recommend watching this in theatre, and with an open mind.

(You don't really need to watch the first part. They introduce the previous characters well and the first part isn't really that good either)","21 January 2023",9,2,2
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","This movie is quite literally the best movie i have seen all year. The animation is beautifully stunning. It is the best animations since spiderman into the spider verse. The use of color was fantastic and the fight scenes were dynamic and interesting while being original too.

The character development was beautiful, the main villain was terrifying. I quite literally got chills every time the villain appeared on screen.

I went into this movie expecting a stupid children's movie that me and my brother could make fun of but I left having seen a movie that I will never forget.

I have seen it in theaters twice already. I will never stop recommending this movie.","15 January 2023",10,9,12
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","I'm sure a majority of the people who heard about this film had little to no intention in actually seeing it, much less expecting it to actually be really good. The first Puss in Boots film was decent but it far from struck me as one of DreamWorks' best. Seeing the studio go all in on a sequel that nobody asked for was a ballsy move, but fortunately they absolutely got it right.

Puss in Boots The Last Wish is an unexpectedly fantastic film that not only tells a great story, but it takes risks by diving into topics of death and mortality, something that you wouldn't expect from an animated kids' film. Not only that, but much of the humor was very risky, with the cursing jokes being the ones that made my eyes open widest. It wasn't a bad thing to me, it just really caught me off-guard. I always like it when animated films take risks without making it seem like they're trying to hard to be edgy. This film doesn't do the unnecessary. It's a fantastic adventure with a great story, great humor, great characters, and beautiful animation. Go see this film while you still can. It deserves your money.","6 January 2023",8,5,7
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","This film is extremely entertaining, hilarious, but also intriguing and can be genuinely intense. It has some very dark scenes and a surprising amount of violence, which is complimented by a ton of great dark humor (mostly brought on by John Mulaney's character). The characters are all very well developed and fleshed out, many of them get satisfying archs. On the technical side, this film is incredibly animated and every frame looks gorgeous. It has a unique style on the animation that really makes this movie unique.

I always complain about finales that are underwhelming, but this movie had an amazing finale that is not too short or too long, has some amazing battles, character archs, and satisfying moments (also the setpiece they use is AWESOME)

This movie is great for kids and adults. It's just that good.","15 January 2023",10,4,5
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","I loved the villain, so much so that I think my 8 year old self would have been freaked out by the scenes he appears in.

An amazing animated film, it has some nostalgic and fun references for those of us who saw the first part as kids. Puss in Boots is a character that is impossible not to love, who attracts us with his witticisms and his great adventures. Although this time we see him in a facet full of anxiety and despair, I personally managed to feel sadness and empathy for him, which shows the great direction of the film.

The scenes I loved the most are the ones in which the villain appears, the action scenes are very good and the great animation stands out. A movie worth watching and I look forward to a third installment.","29 December 2022",10,6,10
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","This move is really good , i went in with too low expectations , but seriously the art , the colors & the story is the perfect mix.

I added this movie to my favs list
Definitely worth watching on the big screen

Very rich in emotions & meaning - & the jokes is really well put & in place

The storyline. & directors efforts is really reflecting in this movie & it s best in this series hands down in all aspects compared to the other movies.

I wish to see more of this series now after all these years they really did a good job reviving it & bringing it back to life

Couldn't ask for a better movie.","14 January 2023",10,7,10
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish",""" . . . Little dog, too"" Big Jack H-o-r-n-e-r quotes the Wicked Witch of the West from THE WIZARD OF OZ. Just as in that 1900's feature film, the team of spotlit characters in PUSS IN BOOTS: THE LAST WISH learn that they do NOT need Ruby Red Slippers or a witch's magic spells to find their rightful home and family. As with the quartet of Dorothy Gale, the Scare-Raven, Tin Man and Cowardly Lion, the title character, along with Kitty and the tag-along sock mutt, learn that they've had the key to contentment within easy reach all along. For a sequel, this story seems very fresh and imaginative, providing a new spin on several classic storybook creatures in a very provocative and entertaining manner.","4 January 2023",9,3,5
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","No need to say, the visuals of this film are outstanding! When you're too fed up with the boring same old 3D animated movies, this is a movie will bring you a fresh air! A mix of 3D and 2D painterly style really bring the fairy tales look to the film!

The story is emotional yet hilarious! Not only the Puss in Boots got his story developed and redemption arc, the antagonists also have their story told too! And on top of that, all of their stories are emotional and told beautifully.

Bonus point, their fighting scenes are much much more believable than other films at the theaters these days too. They don't just magically kill the bad guy while being inferior to them, they fight with wit and STYLE.

Dreamworks really did it again with this movie! Can't wait to see what they can bring to the table next time!","22 December 2022",10,10,14
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","This movie didn't need to go so far but it did. The writing, animation, designs, environments and music are all superb. You can tell the team behind this put in their purest amount of effort into every nook and cranny of this film.

Even in the Shrek universe this film builds and adds more immersion and depth to it, creating a new appreciation to the past movies and makes you reflect on them in an even deeper and brighter way.

By the end of the movie you will learn to appreciate your life in a whole new way and be thankful you watched this.

Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is an astonishing family friendly film to be rewatched in future living rooms for decades to come.","11 January 2023",10,8,10
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","Puss in Boots: Last Wish was an incredible display of high quality storytelling and masterful script writing. Besides some small critiques of the animation style and some crude humor, the film was near perfect.

The storytelling was unique to the franchise and seemed genuinely inspired. The script reflects this. Without giving too much away, Puss learns valuable lessons, and the film itself contains a good overall moral message.

The film can seem a bit dark at times with lots of comedic but somewhat frightening deaths, however some jokes are spread throughout to lighten the tone.

Personally, I felt the antagonistim was one of the most well written of all time. Very reminiscent of the Oscar winning character of Anton Chigurh from No Country for Old Men.

The animation was intentionally low frame rate in action scenes, however I found it worked much better in the final scenes where the frame rate was the full 24 (not 12). Some might find the film anticlimactic in a few ways, but overall, most would find the movie well worth their time and money.

9/10 stars!","28 December 2022",9,5,8
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","Puss in Boots: The Last Wish (2022) is a movie my daughter and I saw in theaters last night. The storyline follows Puss in Boots who dies and is informed he is on the last of his nine lives. He decides to retire from being Puss in Boots until he hears the story of a Last Wish that can be granted to a person who finds the Wishing Star. He decides to come out of retirement to find the star but he isn't the only one looking for it; and meanwhile, death himself is chasing him down. He will need to rely on some old friends and a new one if he hopes to succeed.

This movie is directed by Joel Crawford (The Croods: A New Age) and contains the voices of Antonio Banderas (The Mask of Zorro), Salma Hayek (Desperado), Florence Pugh (The Falling), John Mulaney (Big Mouth) and Olivia Colman (Hot Fuzz).

The storyline for this picture is very smart with more depth than you may anticipate. The animation is tremendous and the action and fight scenes are fun. The opening sequence with the troll, the battle with the wolf in the bar and the final fight were excellent. The map scene was cool too. The voices are perfectly selected and it was great seeing Hayek's return. The dialogue is very well written and contains more depth, emotion, comedy and lessons than I anticipated going in. The little dog was an awesome new character and Harvey Guillén (The Internship) was a perfect choice as its voice. The ending was a perfect way to close each storyline and sub plot.

Overall, this is a very well done movie that is fun for the entire family. I would score this a 7.5-8/10 and strongly recommend it.","15 January 2023",8,2,3
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","Directors Joel Crawford and Januel Mercado made an extremely pleasant movie Puss in Boots: The Last Wish. Antonio Banderas as Puss in Boots missing the point of having this life and miserable because he exhausted all his other 8 lives is forced to spend time with Kitty Softpaws ( really enjoyed Salma Hayek's voice) and happy to have friends and be called anything Perro (Harvey Guillen's voice). Puss in Boots used to be the Favorite Fearless Hero and has to go through life's journey learning the realities of life. Perro is a dog "" without a name"" whose
happiness in having friends and affection are contagious and it takes a while for Kitty Softpaws and Puss in Boots to realize that Perro is very likeable.

Florence Pugh's voice as angry, loud, selfish Goldilocks is perfect. Papa Bear, Mama Bear and Baby Bear are adorable and try hard to put Goldilocks in her place.

Script is excellent. 1hr40min of fun . Don't ask for more. Excellent editing.","28 December 2022",10,4,7
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","I am a loss for words, what an astonishing dreamworks film 2nd behind How to train your dragon. Such an amazing plot, I love all the fairytale essence of the film. Animation is comparable to a freshly baked cookie your grandma made on a sunny day, I love how we got a bigger picture from the 2011 puss and boots. Immersing into their minds and fears. The art style is so unique, this is a step up of the decade for dreamworks. All these years I thought dreamworks would never go back to a fairytale plot that is fun and exciting for children and adults. Amazing humor compared to modern kids films. I small bit of Shrek's profanity back in the early 2000s is used again, plot was no where near childish but just right. The so called ""villian"" wasn't predictable whats so ever, it was a twist so amazing. Character designs are so pretty to look at, goldi and the 3 bears is just what makes the film even better.","15 January 2023",10,4,5
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","Besides the presence of Kitty, I could've been convinced that there was no Puss in Boots 1. The sequel is closer to standalone than direct. And more than just being different story-wise, Puss in Boots is not even close to the same movie as the first one. For starters, the animation is really creative. It takes a page out of Spider-Verse to look intentionally choppy at times by messing with the frame rate to give it a comic-like feel. To aid this, the art in this movie is incredible. Some things are more abstract than realistic, there are beautiful colors that contrast, and there's tons of creative scenery. It almost feels like the creative team made beautiful paintings and tried to build a movie out of it rather than make a movie and then fill in the scenery, which works really well here. Next, the movie is way darker. It's plenty funny like all DreamWorks movies, but whereas the original was entirely fun, this one was very dark. The wolf villain, in particular, was one of the scariest villains of the year. The dark aesthetic, the voice acting, the uncanny whistle and soundtrack, and the camerawork all created fear perfectly. He was probably my favorite part. Also like all DreamWorks movies, it's sweet and heartwarming. The only downside of this movie is that, besides the animation, nothing blows me away. It's not as funny as The Bad Guys, as heartwarming as How to Train Your Dragon, or as action-packed as Kung Fu Panda. Everything about it is good but not great. But the brilliant animation gets an otherwise decent movie to become nearly perfect.","12 January 2023",9,3,4
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","Great character development and such a well told story. I thought it would be just a casual fun movie but it was a well thought out story of dealing with your past mistakes while facing your mortality. The hero's were strong, relatable, and vulnerable while never subverting who they were.

Each of the character has a personality, contribution and place in the story that makes sense. None of them are forced in for a quota or seem out of place. All the moves have a purpose and the writers deserve all the praises for this.

Great growth and shows that Hollywood can still put together a good movie when they want to. Really beat my expectations.","8 January 2023",10,6,8
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","Today I saw Puss in Boots latest movie, ""The Last Wish"". It's fast-paced and packed with action and humor right from the start. I was able to enjoy the best 100 minutes.

Puss in Boots is a fearless hero. He is a reliable cat who lives with friendship and dreams. Anyone who loves cats should definitely watch this movie! Every character in this movie is unique and interesting, and the soundtrack selection is so good.

This is one of the best animated movies of 2022. Animated movies usually have a few boring scenes, but in this movie the story progresses so fast that the viewer doesn't get bored.

Puss in Boots has many other movies, but I understand that ""The Last Wish"" is highly rated. I plan to watch this movie again this year. Recommended as a family movie for the whole family to watch.","10 January 2023",8,2,3
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","I was not at all interested in watching this film. As most of the animated movies from the major studios, especially from DreamWorks have been extremely dull and very samey. I can't think of a good one that I've seen since How To Train Your Dragon 2.

But then I read all of the brilliant reviews and decided to give this one a go. And to my surprise, it was definitely a welcome change.

Puss gets an existential crises when Death (AKA the Big Bad Wolf) comes for his last life after Puss has frivolously wasted his 8 other ones. It's interesting how dark it gets in these scenes, with Puss, who has never been afraid of death, gets scared and has a wakeup call. And learns to value life and the lives of others a bit more.

Although it doesn't go as far as I thought it would when it came to heavy themes and character development, it certainly reminded me of the good old days of DreamWorks animation. So I absolutely consider this film a step in the right direction for this studio.","21 January 2023",8,1,1
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","However, this movie is truly perfect.

Not only is this the better of the Puss In Boots films but it's honestly one of the best animated films that I've ever seen. The movie has incredible voice acting, hilarious moments, tremendous action sequences and beautiful animation. If you're a fan of the unique art style of ""Into the Spider-verse"", you'll truly appreciate the style that this film throws out at times.

It also has so much heart. This movie pulls on the heart-strings as much as any animated film could possibly do.

Also, Wagner Moura's character is done so well that you'll leave the film with a lasting impression of him.

If you're on the fence about seeing this movie, please watch it. For me, this film came completely out of nowhere and it honestly shocked me how well it was done.

Great stuff!","28 December 2022",10,6,8
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","I was not expecting much from this film but I had heard much praise of it and so I went to the theatre and watched this film with an open mind.

First off..WOW!!! The animation and character design is gorgeous and the characters are captivating. I really like the new style for Puss in Boots in this film. The action scenes are incredible and put you on the edge of your seat. I could talk about the characters designs and art direction for this film all day if I could. Some characters in the film are a bit annoying though, but in the end your grudge against them seem to vanish when they all resolve the big conflict. Also LOVE the humor in this movie. Great for kids, teenagers and adults alike!","31 December 2022",10,5,8
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","If you wanna have an absolute mesmerizing cinematographic experience, then I only have one advice for you: go to your local theater and watch Puss in Boots the last wish.

Although there is no such thing as a perfect movie, this one does get really really close to perfection.

Firstly, the appearance. The designs and the animation make the movie a real pleasure for the eyes. The colors are vibrants, the texture looks like a painting it's just so beautiful.

Secondly, the story.. it's basically a quest, and is pretty simple in a way, which leave more places for the characters to be developed and have their own journeys, both externally and internally. The movie isn't afraid of mature themes, such as the fear of death, the inability of trusting someone or even animal abuse.

Thirdly, the characters. They're all are so deep and well-written. Having only one life left, Puss isn't as reckless as he used to be and become less a legend, and more of a real character. Perrito could've been annoying, but he's just adorable. Kitty soft paws is like in the 1st movie, but better. And her relationship with Puss is much better too, coming from resentment to acceptation and maybe even more.

Goldilocks and the three bears are basically another groups of heroes, even if in this movie they're antagonists because what they want go against what the hero wants. But they're in no way villains. Just a great, funny and moving family (seriously i cried at some point during one of their scenes).

Jack Horner is the perfect incarnation of a villain we love to hate. He's absolutely awful, in a great villainous way. The movie doesn't shy away from his cruelty, it's not trying to give him excuses or a sad back story. Quite the opposite actually. Jack Horner was a spoiled brat who turned into an entitled man with no regards for anyone's life whatsoever.

And the Wolf is just so terrifying and charismatic. Although not exactly a villain, he is the biggest threat to Puss in Boots specifically towards the whole movie.

I could say much more about what makes this movie so great but I really don't wanna spoiled it. I only have one advice for you, go to your local cinema and WATCH IT.","21 January 2023",10,2,2
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","Great movie that is very Well written, cute, and creative. Good message and moral about friendship and trustworthiness. No hidden agendas or political messages, just a cute movie! My kids young and old loved it and the adults were laughing too.

My kids are 8, 10, and 12, and then a few adults were there and we all thought it was hilarious and well written. The story line came together well and pulled together different movie classic stories like Pinocchio, Goldilocks and the three bears, Shrek, Cinderella, etc. We really appreciate the clean humor, innocence in this kids movie, lack of political or ""woke"" ideology, and how well this was written.","27 December 2022",10,9,12
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","It's rare to watch an animated film that actually has a story relatable to both adults and children, and Puss in Boots The Last Wish does just that. For starters, all the voice-overs were outstanding, and all of the characters had something to offer than just their presence in the story. The characters and the story itself had moments of joy, laughter and tears. The humor was particularly relatable and funny, again, for both adults and children. The pacing was spot on and the 102 minute runtime just flew by. This is one of the better animations I've seen in a while, and I love how the ending lead up to the next sequel to Shrek. A must watch for everyone.","8 January 2023",8,3,7
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","Truly an amazing experience, I though it can't be as good as people said, it was better!

It is a visually stunning and action-packed animated film that tells the origin story of the beloved character from the ""Shrek"" franchise. The movie features outstanding voice acting by Antonio Banderas as the titular character, who brings the charming and charismatic feline to life. The film's animation is top-notch, with vibrant and detailed environments, and smooth and fluid character movements. The story is engaging and full of twists and turns that keep the audience on the edge of their seat. Overall, it is a fantastic movie that is sure to entertain both children and adults alike. It is a true cinematic experience that should not be missed.","11 January 2023",10,7,8
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","Came for the reviews, wasn't disappointed. Appealing usage of color, enjoyable reconfiguration of fairy tales, and interesting choice of voice actresses. The action sequences are definitely the highlight of this movie, as all of camera work, animation, and choreography work spotlessly, comparable to some of the best fight scenes from Attack on Titan or Naruto Shippuden. Utilizing reflections of eyes, crystal, and the map, the thematic idea of introspection, especially in the face of death, is also brough up, which unfortunately isn't emphasized enough to be memorable. Much of the narration and pacing in the second act is diluted and essentially ruined by the multiple perspectives and excessive characters. However, the major antagonist, Death, is honestly a compelling figure: menacing, dogged, yet chivalrous.","17 January 2023",6,3,6
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","Puss in Boots: The Last Wish was a movie I decided to see with friends just to go out and do something, however almost immediately after the start of the movie my friends and I were all enthralled and entertained. PiB:TLW not only worked as a comedic movie for all ages, but also provided the viewer with an engrossing plot to follow. My friends and I found ourselves glued to the screen at many points. It is definitely a highlight movie within the Shrek Universe and possibly one of the better animated movies to be released in recent years (close to Into The SpiderVerse). If you have the opportunity to check out Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, then I think you should take it!","24 December 2022",10,8,11
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","For me this movie is in between a 7 and a 8 but I gave it a 8 because I want to see it do well. This movie was surprisingly good considering the first was ok and released about a decade ago but they somehow naturally built upon that movie and made this.

The way Puss tackles his mortality was was really, especially with the death character (my absolute favorite character in the movie, along with Jiminy cricket). The way they portrayed death was just excellent from the voice, to the design, to his fight scenes with those sickles. With the intro fight it really does set the tone for the rest of the movie with him having Puss on the run.

Along with Puss the other characters are also great. Every character has a well defined insecurity (idk if that's the right word) minus the dog but he's seems to be happy to care so whatever. Then the other main villain is just so fun with all his fairy tale weapons everything is just creative and well written.","27 December 2022",8,3,5
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","I very seldom go to see animation, and today I saw Puss in Boots, The Last Wish. Due to a technical error at my AMC, my original desired showtime was no longer an option, so stuck with Puss In Boots. I need to be clear, I had very low expectations. I just feel, with Animation of late you get disappointed more than in awe.

There was not a second of film where I lost focus or was thinking what I want to eat or do latter. Puss is told he has one life left and needs to stop being so wild. There is a odd (?) b story with the three bears and Little Jack, played by the talented Mulhaney. Puss is told to go to a cat day care, we meet a dog who talks, and this dog is essentially our "" Donkey."" We escape the day care, and try to follow our last wish.

The supporting characters are pretty hit or miss. The bear storyline really added nothing to me. What was great about this film, this felt like early 2000's Dream Works Animation. Simply superb animation. Now, not having seen Puss one, and gave up with the Shrek franchise on number 3, how does Puss become who he is? How did Puss and Shrek meet? I guess I need to watch Shrek 3, 4 and Puss one then.

All in all, I was hooked for the whole story. Great voices and outstanding animation.

A+","22 January 2023",10,1,1
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","Today I watched a shrek sequel and it was very good

Yeah, this movie was a complete shocker to me as I really didn't expect anything from it going in. But uh yeah this movie really does have everything going for it, it's funny, it has a lot of really intense action, there's actual stakes which doesn't feel like the case in most kids movies, and it has a really charming unique personality to it.

If there's anything that I didn't like from the movie, it would really have to be the mixing in the opening of the movie. It felt like Pickles wasn't properly mixed into the scene, and I really could not hear half of the words he was saying, thankfully this only really went on through the first maybe 10-15 minutes of the film, basically when the opening stops. Besides that you can make an argument that there are cliché and predictable elements to this film. There was one instance when i noticed Pickles literally change sizes between scenes and then it never happened again, it was during a fight scene near the beginning where he got tossed around.

However, though its story structure is predictable, this is reductive a bit. It's a three act structure with a typical ending you'd see in 1000 movies till this point, but the way that the movie goes to reach this point feels like it's own unique true journey. Every character reaches their logical end in such a satisfying fashion, it's easy to overlook that. The story basically perfectly led to the ending and didn't really leave me feeling like I could ask for more in that regard from a modern day shrek sequel.

This film genuinely feels like characters are in real danger. It feels like every character, no matter how small or big, has a distinct personality and look to them, and they can absolutely die. That feels really good in a movie to feel like there's a real challenge to overcome, something this movie does excellently. The villains feel like real villains and are actually pretty menacing, showing a real threat within the story to the main characters. Also I cannot tell you how nice it is to have a comic relief character be pivotal to the story and not annoying. Seriously it's so common and annoying(I'll never forgive you treasure planet 😢)

The film looks absolutely gorgeous. It's like a pastel paradise of colors. The animation is smooth when it needs to be and stylistically choppy during intense pivotal points. All of the characters look fantastic and stylistically distinct from the other cgi art styles I've seen in the past. Each character is immediately recognizable as their own. I want to pet the dog.

The action scenes are so dang well executed. It doesn't feel to abnormally fluid and I feel this to be assisted by the intentionally choppy animation style during these scenes. They also use comic book style action lines to emphasize certain movements and to drag your eyes to what they want you to focus on. The bad guys did something LIKE this basically but I feel that this movie really improves upon that style.

Overall, I could spend a long time talking about how awesome and surprising this movie was for me. It was genuinely great, and probably my favorite shrek movie. Isn't that a funny thing to say, your favorite shrek movie is a puss n boots sequel. Please watch this movie it's very good. It's tremendously funny too btw.

High 8/10.","22 January 2023",8,1,1
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","Puss and Boots succeeds in every way. The only thing that isn't amazing in this movie is the ending, which is still good. This movie has deep character development and has some very emotional moments that makes the movie not just enjoyable for kids, but also enjoyable as an adult. The animation style in this movie is amazing. I love the style and cartoony look of the film. I wouldn't recommend this movie to any kids under 6 though due to the emotional moments as well as the villain in the movie which could be scary for little kids. But if you are old enough that the villain won't scare you, the villain is amazing and really makes the movie that much better. Anyway you have to see this movie.","22 January 2023",10,2,2
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","I noticed that the animation and art style would change during the film, and it took some getting used to. At first, I thought it was my eyes playing tricks but it was just the effects. The character designs were good and I like how they put their spin on the fairytales and nursery rhymes. I loved the wolf's design the most, he was such a good character and I looked forward to seeing him whenever he showed up.

The storyline, however, was okay but it felt a bit meh. I wasn't fully invested in it. The character development was nice and steady throughout the film too. Also, the action scenes looked pretty cool.","7 January 2023",6,4,9
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","""Puss in Boots: the Last Wish"" definitely didn't have the right to be this good. This is, by far, my favourite animated film of 2022! I like the first film. It's completely independent from the Shrek movies, Antonio Banderas is a charismatic protagonist and Humpty Dumpty is a great anti-anti-hero. That film wasn't perfect, it had some issues, and these issues are fixed here, and the positive stuff are almost squared.

This is the true epic that our little Gato deserved. The first film has too little expedition and action, it was a lot more focused on universe and character building, so, despite disagreeing, I can understand some people's disappointment. But now, we are in a sequel, and being a sequel for an origin story, there is a lot more creative freedom. The amazing animation style says it all!

The adventure is bigger, more brutal, more romantic, and taken more seriously, though more comically. The only forced moment here was made to be forced. From the previous film, Puss (Antonio Banderas) and Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek) are the only reminiscent ones, and they're even better than they were in 2011. The new supporting cast is more numerous and does an extraordinary job.

Perrito (Harvey Guillén) is one of the best comic DreamWorks has ever made, Florence Pugh's voice fitted Goldilocks perfectly, she and the three bears make a dangerous quartet, and Big Jack Horner (John Mulaney) represents well the unstoppable hunger for power, and there's a famous character interacting with him that's hilarious.

But the real showman here is my fellow countryman, Wagner Moura. The Big Bad Wolf is S tier villain. His presence is threatening, his whistle is chilling, and he has the best villain introduction I saw in a movie since ""Inglorious Basterds"". The best camera placing of 2022 is not in a live action. Curiously, the two best DreamWorks characters of the last year were wolves. Wagner and Sam Rockwell rocked!

The story is original, but far from being unpredictable. However, like a lot of universally acclaimed Pixar movies (which some of them are deservelly acclaimed), it's not what story is being told, but how it's being told. Basic but complex, small but huge, ordinary but legendary! Esta es una aventura digna para el Gato con Botas.","16 January 2023",10,2,3
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","What a wonderful movie, this new 2D-3D animation style is quite the eye candy.

Loved the humor, these people pull stuff that really sets it apart from other animation studios, for some reason I thought there would be a lot of singing but thankfully that's not the case.

They manage to cram quite a few different stories and characters and intertwine and develop them beautifully in the short 100 minutes.

Never felt boring or dragged, the dub (I watched it in Spanish) is spectacular, today I found out Antonio Banderas voices the puss in English, Spanish and Italian, what an absolute gigachad.

I was almost brought to tears a couple times too, a must watch if you're into Dreamworks stuff.","3 January 2023",9,3,5
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","This movie is so fantastic. I'm a huge fan of the first movie, but this movie is stellar. I knew the animation was going to impress me, but based on the trailers, I felt unsure about certain aspects of the movie. However, as many reviewers say, the trailer does not do this movie justice! From the characters, especially Perrito and the Wolf, each and every character is so fleshed out. It set itself up like The Amazing Spider-man 2 but it did so well on the villain execution, which most would think is impossible. There were also emotional elements of this movie, such as fear and anxiety, that are so well portrayed by this movie which has not graced the big screen in a while! Overall, I am very much in love with this movie and I am glad that Dreamworks is back!!","9 January 2023",10,2,4
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","I never expected an animated movie to top my end of year list, much less a sequel to a spin-off to a franchise that hasn't been relevant in 20 years. Coming out of nowhere, seemingly as a much delayed afterthought, the latest Puss in Boots is anything but. Boasting gorgeous animation reminiscent of Into the Spider-Verse but never feeling like a visual rip-off, The Last Wish constantly fires on all cylinders for young audiences and adults alike. The movie's imaginative style that is bound to become a new dazzling showcase for high-end TV screens meshes well with its kinetic set pieces, the funny scenes are actually hilarious and rarely miss a beat, and the recurrent themes of mortality, friendship and identity are as astute as any big, ""mature"" movie you will have seen this year. Couple that with a memorable cast of both returning and new characters and an actually terrifying villain for a change, and you have a genre entry that is shockingly great given its questionable pedigree. Puss in Boots might be down to his last life here, but the franchise is definitely not on its last paws.","9 January 2023",9,2,3
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","We just saw this today and loved it. So many talented voice actors: Salma Hayek, John Mulaney, Florence Pugh to name a few and, of course, Puss In Boots himself, Antonio Banderas.

In the beginning, Puss was the ultimate hero, not caring for himself or anyone else. Over time, he changes.

John Mulaney is the uber-villain, Big Jack Horner. Florence Pugh voices Goldilocks who is part of a small band of thieves including Mama, Papa and Baby Bear. Salma Hayek reprises her role as Kitty Softpaws. Perrito is a heartwarming little dog.

The journey they embark on is an amazing one. Not only meeting Goldilocks and the Three Bears, the evil Big Jack Horner but also a cricket who functions as a conscience and sounds like Jimmy Stewart.

The animation is wonderful, similar to The Bad Guys.

Most enjoyable!","14 January 2023",6,2,3
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","I have been watching animations movies since I was a little kid. I have watched sad ones, happy ones, all kinds of animations. This movie in particular is so heartwarming, I couldn't hold back my tears in the end.

I got shivers everytime Wolf appeared.

The redemption of Puss in Boots is just wonderfully well made. You can clearly see Puss improving himself and he didn't lose his personality. He is not out of the character.

This movie made me laugh and cry, but for the right reason. You should give a chance to this movie and open up your heart. Believe me, you won't regret a thing. In the end, you will want to watch it over and over again.","16 January 2023",10,3,5
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","Here is my review of Puss in Boots: The Last Wish. I am genuinely blown away by how much I loved it. I will start off by mentioning how good the animation is. Holy cow it is superb and just beautiful to look at. The animation also accompanies the fantastic action to make it all the better. I watched it in Spanish so it didn't have the all of the same voice actors, besides Banderas and probably Salma Hayek, but everyone did an excellent job, especially from the main two I just mentioned. The fact that Puss in Boots only has one life left gives the story a lot more emotion than I was anticipating. This also gives way for themes about death, enjoying life while it lasts, making the most of it, and accepting your fate. The wolf is shown to be a frightening and threatening presence that for once makes Puss afraid, he not only gave Puss chills but gave me chills every single time he was on screen. The moments where we see Puss fearing death are arguably the most effective and emotional. All in all, this is easily my favorite animated movie of the year and maybe the biggest surprise of the year as well.","16 December 2022",9,7,10
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","Puss in boots finally comes out 11 years after we we last saw the lovable el gato's adventure and let's just say that (Puss in Boots:The Last Wish) is everything that we wanted in the sequel for the legend himself. The animation is out of this world, with the film prioritizing a similar style like ""Spider-Man:Into the Spider-Verse(2018) and The Bad Guys (2022). The story is a great improvement from the first film with puss given a huge amount of character development that allows conflict to subside with his personality that remains after the first film while allowing every character to tackle serious/darker topics that doesn't conflict with it's comedic tone. The film even carry's over a hilarious amount of comedy that is familiar from the first shrek film.","31 December 2022",10,3,5
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","I was so shocked when I saw this. The first ten times I watched this I passed out from shock. Words can not describe the greatness of this movie. It's like watching a billion dollars come from the sky and into my arms. There was so much action that there are less action verbs than action scenes in this movie. The comedy was so funny I cracked three ribs from watching this movie. I had a concussion and three veins pop from my head. I had to go to the E. R twenty two times. The villain in this movie was so well done he gave me the heebee jeebees and I pee'd my pants from how scary he was. There is no experience like puss in boots.","14 January 2023",10,4,5
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","Being a huge fan of Shrek and Shrek 2, I will always check out anything new this franchise has to offer. Like many others, I was disappointed with Shrek the Third. Shrek Forever After was fine and even though I enjoyed the first Puss in Boots for what it was, my enthusiasm for the franchise has started to fade over the years. For this reason alone, I was very unsure about a Puss in Boots sequel. It's been so long since the first one and I didn't even love that film. Well, colour me incredibly surprised. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is now playing in theatres and available on-demand and I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed it.

Following Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) many years after the events of the rest of the franchise, his love of action and adventure has caught up with him. He has used eight of his nine lives and is visited by death. He is told that the next time he dies will be the end. This has him taking a second look at his life. Learning that there may be a chance of restoring his lives by venturing into the Dark Forest, he sets out on a quest to do so. Accompanied by Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek) and Perrito (Harvey Guillén), this is both a hilarious/fun adventure and an emotional tale that really worked for me.

They have updated the animation here as well and I thought it looked very unique. I don't think this style would've worked for a Shrek film, but Puss in Boots: The Last Wish was impressively stylistic. As always, Antonio Banderas was great as the titular hero's voice and it was great to see Salma Hayek return as well. I'm not very familiar with Harvey Guillén's work, but his voice work for the character of Perrito had me laughing quite often, so kudos to him for that. The look of this film, the sound design, the story, and every voice actor were all standouts to me. I got a kick out of this film.

To wrap this up, I guess my big complaint (even though I really don't want to complain about anything in this film) would be that it's almost too frenetic at times. It has a pace that never lets up, which is great because that never hurts the story, but I would've liked a few more beats to enjoy the dramatic moments. They took the time in the screenplay to write some moving dialogue, especially for a kid's film, but it never felt explored quite enough. I would've also complained about some side characters and what was a seemingly pointless storyline, but I enjoyed how that all played out by the end too. I can't say I loved this film, but it's a great watch at least once. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish gets a recommendation from me.","18 January 2023",8,1,2
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","Unbelievably cool movie. I was expecting fun and stupid kids movie, and it appeared that is one of the best movies IMAO. Super wise. Clever scenario. The effects are on another level. Most of all, it gives an extremely important perspective and will help kids to become better than us facing life and hardship, having a good example.

I have never seen an enemy to become ally in such a way....or that our biggest enemy is our fear. After all it appeared that Puss didn't want 9 new lives or anything - he wanted to live in the way he is...to be himself. After facing his fears and becoming better version of himself, he became worthy to keep his live. The concept about the businessman presents an very big problem in our society - it is awful and strange but it is just like that! It is even worse it the way I have seen it. Gold girl find out that we must be happy with what we have. And so on. Nice!","28 December 2022",10,4,6
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","This movie was alright. The animation is the highlight, even though the style they use is just ripped off from a much better movie: 'Spider-Man Into the Spiderverse'. I haven't seen the first 'Puss In Boots', but I would put this one beneath all the 'Shrek' movies, and 'Shrek' 3 and 4 aren't very good.

The story is fast-paced, but the way it unfolds is very bland and uninspired. The attempted humor missed 95% of the time because it's lazyily written and geared solely towards 5-year-olds. If you're an adult, you're not going to find much to enjoy in regards to the story or comedy.

It was nice seeing Antonio Banderas have fun with the voice acting. All the new characters introduced and their motives were all pretty bad and just seemed thrown into the movie for no real reason since they held no weight or attachment to the 'Shrek' universe. My niece and nephew enjoyed it at least.

6.1/10.","31 December 2022",6,11,37
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","One of the greatest movies ever made I've seen a lot of new animated films, particularly those from Disney and Pixar, and this one maintained their level of excellence while never wasting my time. I enjoyed the film; it reminded me of old, good Pixar movies and cartoons, and it had a good storyline that I enjoyed, so I enjoyed this film. But it's not that I dislike other new animated films; this one reminds me of the charming old cartoons that are difficult to find nowadays, and the film also starts off well. It's been a while since we've seen a Puss in Boots film, and this one, like the others, is fantastic.","23 January 2023",10,2,2
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","Super bad animation... Twelve years ago the animation looked like real animation.... what's this??? The character designing seem thirty years old but just faster than how it was back then... Couldn't connect at all with the script and creation.... It's a similar disaster like ""adventures of buck wild"" they ruined an interesting character back then, they are ruining another now... It happens when u employ impassionate people and make them work under poor direction... But it's not the worst disaster so go ahead and give it a shot.... Maybe you'll find something interesting that I missed.... Let me know in your review.","6 January 2023",2,21,102
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","There's been some uneven family & animated films in 2022: Sonic 2 was big screen fun junk food, Lightyear while good missed the mark and dragged, and Rise of Gru was not a good film and was carried by the Minions.

Puss N Boots though was a very pleasant surprise. Had some really great characters like Goldilocks and the 3 bears, the little doggie, and of course Puss. Film had some solid animation and decent story that felt a combo of Shrek and Kung Fu Panda

Unfortunate that Universal/Dreamsworks didnt time this films release better or market it better. Mid October / early Thanksgiving would had been better.

Very good alternative to Avatar 2.","1 January 2023",8,2,4
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","This is good movie, the fans are definitely enjoys and new audiance are also understand this film. The characters are very well written and the storyarc of the each character is perfectly narrated in a clear and heartwarming manner.

The recent sequels are all failing to thier originals because they lack the proper story and they basically extentions of the original movie but this film was written very creatively that you will defintely enjoy. This film got the humour, beatiiful sceneries, heartfelt sentiment , good action sequences and most importantly very well written screenplay.

My favorite characters in this whole movie are DEATH and GOLDILOCKS. I am expecting the return of GOLDILOCKS character in upcoming sequels which is voiced beautifully by Florence Pugh, and DEATH was the best character written in the recent years. You dont expect character like DEATH in children animation film but the crew pull it off very effeciently.

The screenplay was good that you appreciate every character and easy to understand and with stellar voice cast this film has become must watch and i definitely siggest this movie.","7 January 2023",8,2,4
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","I had almost no interest in seeing this movie. Before my first viewing I was certain that the film was going to be another Dream Works cash grab from an old franchise. Boy was I wrong!!!

This film was incredible. It is funny, witty, exciting, beautiful, and at times terrifying!! That is right, terrifying! There were some very well executed villain choices that push the limits of what you would find in a traditional kids movie. I found myself on the edge of my seat the whole film waiting for the antagonist to appear... when he did I was genuinely scared. I wish Hollywood would make villains (and movies) like this more often.

Did not see this coming... I strongly advise that everyone go and watch this movie. Dream Works, and the rest of Hollywood, need to be reminded that you can make a great film that appeals to kids and adults. THIS FILM IS PROOF OF THAT.","5 January 2023",10,4,6
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","The first puss in boots was a pretty generic spin off from the Shrek series but this movie is a step up in every single way. The animation has a lot of spiderverse vibes but still contains its own interesting visual style that just reels you in. The villains are also SPECTACULAR! The wolf might be one of the scariest and intense Dreamworks villains of all time. Kitty soft paws didn't mean much to me in the first movie but she has a very good arc that makes you enjoy her character a lot more, also puss in boots actually has an interesting arc and he is just such a better protagonist. Also the dog is such a great introduction, not only is he funny but he has a really charming personality that makes you adore him every second he's on screen. In all honesty puss in boots the last wish is the best animated movie of 2022.","27 December 2022",10,5,8
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","I saw this movie for the second time, this time with my mom, sister, Ashlyn, and Alan. It was such a fun movie and actually left me sitting back with the my heart racing. It left me with a burning sensation, of wanting to do something with my life. Overall everyone really liked the movie rating it either a 9 or a 10. It was hilarious and had such a great message. I feel like I watch a lot of movies that mold and shape my life, and this is definitely one of them. I felt great watching this movie and can't wait to see what I do this next upcoming year. Thank you to the makers of puss in boots you guys did a great job I will definitely be thinking of this movie a lot :)

I watched it again with Thomas and Chaseton, we had a great time and wouldn't stop laughing when he did the thumb thing lmao

Movie count: x2.","11 January 2023",9,3,4
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","The essence of the previous ones and ""Shreck"" is not present, the scathing wink to the adult audience with adult and politically incorrect jokes, which greatly amused the parents and adult spectadors in general.

It is too politically correct and becomes bland with no guts.

Technically well done, it has an interesting plot that can please both adults and children, but it lacks the ""spice"", that ""forbidden"" humor present in the previous scripts.

It's lame, a reflex of today's times, with this Hollywood tendency to avoid hurting sensibilities and producing an increasing number of uninteresting movies. How I miss the 80's!

I believe it is cyclical and when the ties get loose again, it will fall to the other extreme. It's happened before. While we wait leting out a huge yawn and succumbing to nostalgia.

Reasonable but not very interesting, I only recommend it to hardcore fans.","20 December 2022",5,21,132
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","I'll get this out of the way first. This movie is fantastic. Plain and simple. It's great. It's creative, it's funny, it's touching, it's scary, it's mature, it's intelligent, it's entertaining for both kids AND adults, it's... A goddamn Puss in Boots The Last Wish. I think we can all agree that this is the last title anyone here can associate with top notch quality. I mean it's a sequel to a spin-off movie from over 10 years ago. A rather mediocre one at that. And yet this movie goes far and beyond ANY expectations and makes itself into probably THE best animated movie of 2022. But then again. This is coming from a studio that made Kung Fu Panda series be known as one of the finest animation series as well.

But let's get to the details. First being the animation. It's gorgeous. It's amazing how well this movie looks with it's Spiderverse like animation and further proves how chasing after realizm in animated movies is at this point a fool's errand that kind of misses the point of animated movies. But it's not just a rip-off Spiderverse in looks. Oh no. When that movie looked like a comic book that came to life, this one feels like a Illustrated Fairy Tale book. The paint brush aesthetic looks great, it's colorful and feels alive. It's animated in a fantastic way and I think it's best described in saying that the fight with the Giant from the trailers is NOT the best part of this movie. Oh no. It only gets better from there. 10/10 on visuals.

Now to the characters. I love pretty much all of them. Puss in Boots of course takes center stage here and his character is at it's best here in terms of depth and humor. He is cocky bastard at first, but as he loses his next to last life he quickly gets humbled and reminded of his now very apparent mortality and his character goes through great amount of growth. It's very nice to see his character evolve like it does in this movie. Another stand out I say is the Wolf who I can already tell will give several children nightmares. People that made this DO NOT hold back with how scary they make this character. He is by far the best thing in the movie from his fights, the change in mood whenever he appears and the music that accompanies him. He is definitely one of the best villains I saw in an animated movie (but I could argue if it's okay to call him one, but that would mean getting into spoilers). Other characters such as Kitty Softpaws, Goldielocks, Three Bears, Jack Horner and Perrito are all VERY fun as well. Goldie and her family are a very sweet family that go through their own journey in this and could be said they are deutragonists of this movie, I really enjoyed them, their chemistry and their sweet development. Jack Horner though... I say this. He is by far the funniest part in this movie. He is a bastard, plain and simple and he is hilarious because of it and a certain character that is alongside him for a good chunk of the movie. As for Kitty, it's very nice to see her back and her story tied with Puss is very interesting and I like how they do not linger too long on her drama with Puss and resolve it in a more real way that doesn't derail the movie in any way. And then there is Perrito who many probably thought was going to be an annoyance, but he is by far the Heart of this movie and he is involved in probably the most touching scene in the movie. You will know when you see it. All in all characters another 10. It's incredible how there are so many of them and all of them are fun and likeable in their own way.

The story itself is very simple. It's a race to get the Last Wish from a fallen star. It's as Fairy Tale-ish as you can get. But the way it's executed, the way each character changes (well most of them at least) on this journey and how imaginative and creative the setups and environments are make it feel fresh and it really leaves an impact on you. Don't be fooled by the marketing. This movie deals with VERY heavy subjects such as death, mortality and appreciating one's life and acceptance of Death. It's a heavy movie in terms of themes, but it's so great to see that with it, it still is a very entertaining movie. With many clever jokes, great pacing, fantastic music (oh my God the music is GREAT in it as well. Heitor Pereira did a A+ job here) and colorful world and characters. It is a movie that can be enjoyed by people of all ages and that is something that is so good to see today. And this movie VERY well utilizes it's PG rating. Kids NEED Parental guidance in this movie, it is not a movie you put on to shut them up. You put it on because you want to show them something great, something they can have fun with, be scared of and learn from. And I think a lot of adults can sympathize with struggles characters face in this movie and laugh at the more adult jokes as well. Overall from story standpoint it's also 10/10. It's not a new story or message, but it is told in a way that makes it FEEL new and fresh and it tackles it in a mature way.

As for flaws... Ehhhh... Hard for me to find really. To me it's as perfect as animated flick can get. Again PUSS IN BOOTS THE LAST WISH. God is this a weird thing to say. Maybe there are some pacing issues with Goldie's story and her family conflict being resolved quickly during climax and one character is pretty damn 1-dimensional, but I would argue it's to add to the comedy and charm of said character since that one is not meant to be seen as anything more serious. It is not one the same level of greatness as Prince of Egypt obviously, but as far as Shrek movies go or most Dreamworks movies go... or hell, most animated movies go overall it's pretty damn close to the top to me. In Shrek franchise it's on the same level as Shrek 2 to me and it's a high, HIGH praise.

I have to say. I always preferred Dreamworks over Pixar. Yes, they do have FAR lower lows than the animation juggernaut, but to me they had higher highs with movies such as Prince of Egypt or Kung Fu Panda movies (and the fact that I can say Kung fu Panda series is one of the best pieces of animation is hilarious) and I found their good movies to be far more rewatchable than Pixar ones. But since then they kind of went down with quality sadly, but recently with The Bad Guys and now this movie I think it's safe to say that they are officially back and maybe better than ever. This movie I think proves how great movies from Dreamworks can be today and I think if they keep on going in this direction we may get more VERY special movies from this studio. And I wish them the best of luck on this road and for this movie to become greater and greater success, maybe even winning an Academy Award (as meaningless as that became as of late).

What can I say anymore it's about 9.5 to 10/10 to me. I love it. And I think many people will love it as well. Probably not to the same degree as me, but I think this will make your day and the new year that much better. It's worth your money, it's worth your time, it's worth your attention and by all means it's worth watching more than once.","5 January 2023",10,3,4
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","One of the animated films I have been waiting to watch and yes, it never disappoints me! DreamWorks' one of the best films is back!

It is a great film! Puss in Boots is one of my favorite characters! He is really a legend! From the first time I have seen Puss in Boots showed up in Shrek, I have been a fan! Truly a funny, heroic, cute character that everyone would love! Specially, if you are a cat lover!

Antonio Banderas (Puss in Boots) really suits the character of Puss in Boots. His manly, sweet, raspy voice made everything so perfectly good for the character.

Now, I can't wait and so excited for the next film of Puss in Boots where he will meet again Shrek and Donkey! My other 2 favorite characters of DreamWorks! I just can't wait!!!!","6 January 2023",10,2,4
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","I honestly feel like many of the 8+ reviews here are fake and that the public hasn't had enough time to co tribute enough to make an impact.

THE GOOD: the nice songs at the end during the credits roll, the availability of 3D at the theatre, the innocent dog character and the concept of enjoying our one life, our family and good friends rather than focusing on one ""wish"". Mildly entertaining.

THE BAD: storyline was a mishmash. Too many characters and not going into any character or the cause of any actions deeply. You don't really connect to any of the characters.

THE UGLY: Too much violence and swear words. Not for kids, neither for adults.","28 December 2022",2,18,116
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","This funny, charming and adorable, yet often quite dark, gloomy and intense Puss in Boots adventure isn't your typical cash-grabbing kids' movie. It's been over a decade since the first Puss in Boots movie, which was a spin-off in the Shrek franchise featuring the loveable ginger cat in tiny boots wielding a mini sword. But this is unashamedly the best they've done since the first and second Shrek movies.

When Puss in Boots learns that he's already burnt through eight of his nine lives, he embarks on an epic quest to find the mythical wishing star to restore his lives. Get it? Because cats have nine lives? Anyway, it's a pretty simple storyline that doesn't sound, and isn't really too complicated. However, this movie isn't getting all the praise for its animation techniques, vocal performances and all of that, although it definitely deserves major credit for the cast's brilliant work and the gorgeous 3D animation style that likes to pick some moments to do in a clever, witty 2D.

Forgivably, you can never expect a family comedy in theatres that isn't guaranteed to have its extended moments of silly humour, but these very occasional scenes don't overtake the heavy themes this movie wants to consider, which is actually life and death. There are three parties of antagonists, some who are more villainy than the others, but there's fairy tale characters Goldilocks, the three bears and Jack Horner, and similar to the party this movie features as the protagonists, they all have meaning, struggles and thoughtful backstories to them. But it's the main villain who appears as a whistling wolf who provides the sense of dread. And when you take into consideration villain construction, appearances and overall sense of menace, he's one of the best antagonists of the year.

"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","As expected, Puss in Boots The Last Wish is the most enjoyable movie to watch with great animation, action, characters, plot & humor.

This appeals to everyone from kids to eldest as it shows a very deep moral, which is to be grateful for what you have & 1 life is what makes things special.

The characters were also great, especially the antagonist who is supposed to represent fear to the protagonist. His entrance would give me cold vibes.

The humor was very lightened & will make the whole audience laugh, there are some jokes that a lot of kids won't understand due to censored cursing.

The animation & action is a lot better on the big screen, so it's definitely recommended to watch it ASAP.

This movie deserves an epic 10/10 & I can't wait to see what dreamwork holds for us in the future.","16 January 2023",10,3,5
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","""Puss in Boots: The Last Wish"" follows Puss in Boots as he is on his last life. As a cat with nine lives, Puss lived a life of fearless adventure with no regrets. But as he is on his last life, suddenly Puss feels fear like he never has before. He then finds a chance to restore his lives from a wishing star.

Puss in Boots 2 is better than the first ""Puss in Boots"" (2011) film. It isn't necessary to watch the first film, TV show or any of the Shrek films to enjoy this film. This film has great action, music, animation, characters and humor.

One of the things this film does better than most modern animated films is how they use their villains. Puss and company must contend with a few antagonists through the journey. All parties are competent and various levels of funny. One is a sympathetic group, another deliciously over the top, and the final just straight up scary. Through this the film is able to keep up a good pace, always be exciting and entertaining. Like the villains, the hero group is also well done. They have terrific comedic chemistry, between the two jaded adventurers and the naive overly optimistic companion, I could see myself enjoying 3 more films with this crew.

As far as negatives go, some of the lessons our heroes learn are a bit predictable, even for little kids, I'm sure they've heard these messages before. And I personally have never been a fan of the ""wish"" as a McGuffin. I always think of 10 better wishes the people could use. There is also one part where I think the film's pacing drags.

Where ""Shrek 2"" I walk away talking about all the great jokes. In this film I walk away talking about the great action sequences. The film is funny throughout, but the adventure is the best part. The ""Shrek"" films always seemed to make their stories with a self-aware wink to the camera. ""Puss in Boots 2"" is far more sincere in its story telling and emotional beats. The humor never gets in the way of its more serious moments. It is the type of film where I could see kids laughing and crying when they watch.

This is DreamWorks at its very finest. This Last Wish is the stuff Dreams are made of.","10 January 2023",8,1,2
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","Thank you DreamWorks and Universal. Thank you for a movie that's just about the story. This movie was reminiscent of the before times. There's no extra noise or agendas to explain to an eleven year old. Just good wholesome entertainment for any type of family or any individual. I had forgotten about this series and was so happy to see it back to life and even happier there is more to come. Puss n boots final wish is the epitome of what family entertainment is supposed to be. Good story, great message, fun characters and excellent casting. My hope is other studios take note of the success of this movie and follow suit.","16 January 2023",9,2,4
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","""Puss in Boots: The Last Wish"" was one of the biggest surprises of 2022. This was not a movie that anyone was asking for, yet it was incredibly charming and fun. The film merges two animation styles, which are both gorgeous and cutting edge. There are moments of traditional DreamWorks animation and others that are similar to ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"".

The characters introduced in this film are reminiscent of those in the first two ""Shrek"" movies. Each character is carefully thought out, and evokes an emotional response, whether that be hope, fascination, or fear. From the confused Goldilocks to the adorable Perrito to the fearsome Lobo, everyone brings something new to the table.

There is honestly not a lot to criticize about ""Puss in Boots: The Last Wish"". The film hit darker notes than previous ""Shrek"" films and there were moments in the theater when kids shrieked. Some of the scenes are a little drawn out, but the story itself is strong.

For those with small children, be aware that there is a strong use of ""hell"" and some cleverly censored words throughout the movie. Otherwise, the film is perfectly appropriate (more than some other ""Shrek"" movies) for kids.

""Puss in Boots: The Last Wish"" is the best animated film of 2022 and the best ""Shrek"" film since ""Shrek 2"" (not that the competition is very stiff). The animation is stunning, the voice-acting crisp, and the story is interesting for both children and adults. Even if you haven't seen the first ""Puss in Boots"", go and see this movie. You will not be disappointed.

Also, the new DreamWorks opening is excellent.

Best Character: Perrito
Best Scene: Reading the map
Best Quote: ""Maybe one life is enough"" - Perrito.","7 January 2023",9,1,3
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","It's been nearly two decades since the adorable Puss made his screen debut in Shrek 2 and 11 years since his starring debut. In an elaborate action sequence that opens his new animated adventure Puss In Boots : The Last Wish, he is looking to redeem his lives since he is down to his last one.

Puss in Boots: The Last Wish mixes stunning animation (with storybook illustration style) with a poignant, surprisingly mature story to deliver an amazing sequel for an adventurer. It is darker in tone but still is funny and compelling by all means. With an excellent cast and style, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is one gorgeous and dynamic fractured fairy tale. DreamWorks Animation has done an amazing job, and yes they are renowed to get better with franchise sequels (Madagascar and Kung Fu Panda, not Shrek though)

My Rating : 8.5/10.","7 January 2023",9,1,3
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","Finally, someone reminded the giant studios how movies are made. The animation is incredible. DreamWorks decided to change the style of the cartoon for the better and they succeeded. The comic book style of ""Spider-Man: Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" and a bit of anime animation wink at the cat. The cartoon has enough morals. So you will have a lot to think about after watching it. And the main antagonist is one of the best antagonists in cartoons in general. His movements, look, and charisma make you scared. The sequel does not depend on the events of the first part and the series of Shrek cartoons. It tells a new story on its own, about a well-known fairy-tale character who, having spent his 8 lives, is afraid to lose his last one, running away from death itself. Visually, the cartoon is bright and fabulous. It was very unexpected that the director of the failed projects Trolls and The Croods: A New Era"" Joel Crawford, was able to make this masterpiece and wipe Disney's nose. So I recommend it to everyone.","22 January 2023",9,1,1
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","Upon discovering that he spent his 8 lives and only one remains, Puss gets scared, and flees to a crazy cat lady, where he becomes a house cat. He encounters Perrito... a dog disguised as a cat, who is full of life and hope, and is the main reason why this movie didn't suck in my opinion. I started watching my watch to see when the movie would stop around the 45min mark, and only Perrito made me want to stay. His one liners, while discovering a world that he never actually saw, is kind of cute and sometimes hilarious. Clearly not at the level of a Shrek, but easy enough to watch if you want to unplug your brain.","5 January 2023",5,6,28
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","What is to say that hasn't already been praised about this movie?

The two villains are incredible, especially the ""side villain"". It's refreshing to have a straight main villain. No lame tragic or misunderstood villains like in Disney (even lack of villains). Just a classic villain.

The B plot with Goldilocks and her bear family was great. I suspect it was to make the movie feel more ""full"", otherwise it would've felt a little empty with just Jack Horner versus Puss.

Puss's side characters were great. I thought the dog was going to be an annoying ADHD character but he's got depth.

90% of the jokes land. The pacing is brisk. Didn't realize it was almost 2 hours because it was so engaging. The driving theme of the story is excellent and well handled and not too in your face.

Please don't let this gem miss you.","7 January 2023",,2,3
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","Story is well written and progresses well. Every scene taken nicely with good elements. No unnecessary absurdness even though its animated. My first time watching Puss even though been seeing posters and hearing about for like past 10 years. Good cast for pull and good animation bringing the character lively and captivating. Must watch. Watched in 2d but 3d might be good too for those wanting in 3d. Its that kind of movie that is good to watch in theatres. Kid friendly too. Liked it much better compared to many animated series that are overly complicated. Those who have pets either cats or dogs especially will connect with this more, on a separate level.","28 December 2022",10,5,7
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","The best dreamworks movie in cinema history. When I saw the first puss in boots movie 11 years ago with my dad we absolutely loved. The story taking place after shrek forever after was perfect for dreamworks . Puss has lived a very different life than shrek and donkey including Fiona . His friend and brother Humpty Dumpty was tried to take his revenge against puss I knew they're was still a good cat in him . Soft paws I say she was so awesome. She was no different then the other dreamworks female characters I remembered from my childhood. But I say she was one fluffy cat . The fairytale characters were more exciting than ever before. They had more expressions and had more storytelling then the books I was read when I was little . But I say shrek and puss in boots have a better happily ever after stories more .

I can't wait for shrek 5 this year .","7 January 2023",10,1,3
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","Wow, I was really pleasantly surprised by this movie. I took my daughter to see it simply because it was the only film that was appropriate for her age, but it ended up being one of the best children's movies I've ever seen. The animation was stunning, the story was engaging, and the villains were well-developed. However, I should note that there are some scary moments, also some light curse words in the film, so it may not be suitable for very young children. Despite this, the overall message of the movie - to live life to the fullest - is uplifting and inspiring. I highly recommend checking it out.","30 December 2022",10,5,7
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","There was a lot of hype surrounding this film, so I had a feeling that it was going to be a good movie, but I had no idea that the movie was going to be THIS good. I walked out of the movie theater pleasently surprised. The film has amazing animation, a great pot, but above all the characters really carry this film. Puss in Boots, the side characters, and the villains are amazing in this film. And a special shout out to the voice actors is in order because the voice acting in this film was simply amazing. I would highly recommend watching this film, it's great for people of all ages. Great work dreamworks!","7 January 2023",10,2,4
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","The cover art or movie poster of the animated movie lured me into watching. I know by heart the story of Puss In Boots because as a child I was fortunate to have an illustrated book of that immortal tale by Charles Perrault. Indeed I should credit the great man for making my childhood a colorful one with his classic fairy tales.

Back to this horrendous C. G. I. Adaptation. Yes it is horrendously bad. It is so bad that people who have read the fairy tale, gasp. I understand the necessity to create something new to ensnare people into watching but to ruin what someone has created and taking the life out of it doesn't appeal to me.

Verdict: Antonio Banderas(Assassins, The 13th Warrior) voice acts Puss in Boots. His co-star Salma Hayek(Desperado, Everly) plays Kitty Softpaws. The plot concern's Puss being killed by bell shortly after
subduing an earthen giant. Waking up, he is informed by a doctor that he only has one life after burning through his past eight and suggests he immediately retire from adventuring. Well Puss doesn't and the rest of the movie concerns comical events as he goes on a journey to find the mystical Last Wish for the Wishing Star so that he can restore the eight of his nine lives that he lost while escaping new enemies.

I've seen too many good animated flicks to go deep into analyzing this one. In short seasoned movie fans won't find this one amusing. I enjoyed Paws of Fury: The Legend of Hank more than this one.","17 January 2023",1,4,38
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","This review is more than anything a PSA to get people to watch this movie. I decided to go see this purely because I heard good things, considering I wasn't the biggest fan of the original as a kid despite loving Shrek. However, not only was this one of if not my favorite theater experiences of the last year, it was so good I already want to see it again.

This film is very separate despite being considered a sequel. It stands on its own as one of the most clever and creative animated films of the last few years. Puss is a great protagonist. The lessons he learns throughout the movie are predictable and easy to grasp for kids while also being portrayed in such heartwarming, complex, and interesting ways that make the moments entertaining for an older audience as well. There are also plenty of subtle dark jokes and other crazy moments that adults will love.

However, it's not just Puss, this entire cast is amazing. This franchise is great at thinking of new fairy tale characters to add to every film, and the ones chosen here are some of the best. Their classic stories are implemented in a way that makes this plot surprisingly unique and well put together. Kitty Softpaws was a welcome return from the first film and the antagonists are all amazing.

I loved the family dynamic of Goldilocks and the bears! Their flashback scene really got me to care for their relationship. Jack Horner was a great vehicle to push the heroes forward and his back and forth with Jiminy Cricket was hysterical. Death was also a great looming threat, being a literal representation of Puss' fears.

I also have to specifically shout out Perro. Harvey Guillen does a fantastic job at bringing to life a cute, comedic relief character that is not annoying. His comedic timing is always on point and occasional dark humor that is blended with his adorably oblivious personality worked very well.

I would love to see him continue to appear in future Shrek and Puss movies. The movie does not overstay its welcome at all. It's relatively short but incredibly well-paced. At a glance, it may seem overstuffed, but the rapid-fire action format of its very intentional and there's still room left for good character moments.

The action is fantastic, being very reminiscent of Spider-Verse in all the right ways. Some of the fight scenes feel pulled out of a Shonen anime. They're all fun and visually impressive.

While not relying on them at all, this movie is also filled with great cameos and nods that will make any Shrek fan happy. I can safely say if this new animation style and writing have some influence on Shrek 5, it could become the best Shrek movie.

Simply put, this movie is incredibly fun. It is a project where you can feel the passion put into it by the writers, animators, and voice actors. This is truly Dreamworks' answer to Into the Spider-Verse. It is a needed unique twist on an existing big franchise and I don't think I could've been more pleasantly surprised by it. Go watch this movie!","9 January 2023",10,1,3
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","I really need more of this one, like I couldn't get enough how great this film was. It has meaningful characters, like everyone in here have meaning for reasons, their own stories, not just regular side characters. The artstyle is spot on with that quality too, like Dreamworks nailed it! The plot is great and I've pretty much enjoyed it so far, keep it simple but not lame, well done again. I teared up a lot when i was in the cinema, the skill of storytelling is amazing! They don't make it too long like it lasted forever, they take it easy and with that, it's perfectly just fine. So, I just want to say, thanks Dreamworks for this one, love P. I. B a bunch.","15 January 2023",10,4,5
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","The last movie came out when I was a kid. I thought it was really fun, but it didn't strike me as a masterpiece the way other movies of the time did. It just felt like a nice little movie to kill some time.

Now that I'm older, I can see that it came out after Shrek the third and Shrek forever after, and it just feels like yet another mediocre (mediogre) movie for children with not as much artistic merit as other Dreamworks titles. It's a fine movie. It's fine.

For that reason, I was expecting nothing out of this one. I saw that it was coming out and my attitude was completely ""Meh"".

Then, it actually came out, and it started getting good reviews. I was very surprised. What could they have done with this franchise to make so many people suddenly like it again?

And then I watched it. Oh boy.

It's so far from the previous three movies that it might as well be from an alternate universe.

There are so many aspects of the film I could talk about, but for me the main ones are the animation and the story.

The animation is top notch. It's clearly inspired by Spiderverse, but it's far form a straight ripoff. It feels vibrant and full of life and it lends itself extremely well to the fast-paced adventure style of the story.

Speaking of which, it's amazing how good the story is. At its core it's very simplistic, like all Shrek movies. There's a wishing star somewhere and several different parties are interested in getting to it. That's it.

But seeing the motivations of the characters for getting the wish is so fun and interesting.

The main one, obviously, is Puss in Boots himself. He's down to the last of his nine lives, so now he wants to use the wish to get his lives back, so he can continue being a reckless, adventurous, fearless hero.

His relationship with death, both literally, and metaphorically, makes this one of the most earnest movies in the Dreamworks catalogue.

The other characters don't get nearly as much focus, which is the right call. Side-characters in animated movies tend to be annoying, but this one doesn't fall into that trap. All characters feel perfectly balanced, which is a massive feat in a movie that has so many of them.

The acting is also amazing. Every character that has screentime in this movie is fun and entertaining to watch, and the main characters are emotionally investing and relatable.

Overall, a refreshing restart to Dreamworks' oldest franchise. It single-handedly shattered my expectations and made me feel genuinely excited to see what they do next.","17 January 2023",9,2,3
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","Puss in boots: The last wish is a solid 7 for me. It is nice to watch overall and good family movie but
i think they could have done better with it
the first half of the movie is poorly written for me and
less interesting to keep up to. Also didn't enjoy the
pink haired guy villian..he didn't give any emotion at all not good as villian and overall character plot was boring. Also new dreamworks intro was turnoff for me.

Also i don't get why they changed old animation it was more realistic and smooth to watch. New one isn't bad either but i personally think old one fit better. The wolf arc was good.","10 January 2023",6,3,6
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) dies. It turns out that it's his eighth death and he only has one more life. He has an existential crisis and retires from his adventures. He is told about a Wishing Star and sets off to restore his lives.

Puss in Boots is a fun character in the wider Shrek universe. It's over a decade since his first stand-alone movie. Ignoring dangers is what make him fun. There is a charming cluelessness to the character. I've never considered the why and how of it all. I certainly didn't consider giving him existential dread as the catalyst for his next movie. This maintains the fun and vibrant energy of Puss in Boots while giving his character some real depth.","15 January 2023",8,0,1
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","""Puss in Boots: The Last Wish"" is one of the most unexpected sequel masterpieces in years. How is it that a decade later a sequel to a spin-off is one of the sharpest, most thoughtful, genuinely hilarious, and heartwarming films of the year?

Undoubtedly one of DreamWorks' best. The writing is brilliant. No second is wasted on this beautiful animation that is much like the Spiderverse. The voice acting was superb! Banderas and Hayek are perfect. Pugh as Goldilocks nearly killed me. All of the cast was great.

This film is quirky, witty, full of heart, and again genuinely funny. It manages to juggle many interesting and memorable characters. Great for all ages with themes of trust, friendship, family, and a satisfying and emotional payoff.","3 January 2023",10,2,4
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","Did not watch the first and original Puss however over the holiday of ""Christmas"" decided to be sentimental and watch for some feel good cheer to see the adventures of a fury male cat as he tries and rules the world.! My parents are cat owners so I felt in the mood to watch this. And the scenes and mood was fun watching Puss travel and be slinky and drink milk also the film's look and cartoon like color make it likable even though it may not be ""Tom and Jerry"" still it's a watch that many adults like me enjoyed. The work and on screen chemistry is good as Antonio Banderas as the voice of Puss is well done and the voice of the sexy Selma Hayek as Kitty gets anyone in a cat like mood. Good well done animated watch!","3 January 2023",7,0,2
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","Puss In Boots: The Last Wish (2022) Review -

Puss In Boots: The Last Wish serves as a sequel to Chris Miller's spin-off Puss In Boots, which was born out of Shrek's Pandora Box. I haven't been a huge fan of the Shrek franchise except for the first film, and moreover, Miller's spin-off didn't suit me either. But now, after watching Joel Crawford's sequel, I might want to join the fan club of Puss In Boots. Sometimes a sequel exceeds expectations and sets a benchmark, and Puss in Boots 2 has done exactly that. Unlike many other animated sequels, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish comes with the promise of cinematic expansion in many aspects, be it characters, storyline, or visuals.

Puss in Boots: The Last Wish follows Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas), who has finally started to fear something, and it's none other than 'death' (a wolf). He starts living a boring and eventless life in a cathouse. As the last hope, he goes on a journey to find the mystical Last Wish for the Wishing Star. Puss teams up with his old friend (girlfriend) Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek) and the little dog from the cathouse, Perrito (Harvey Guillén), to restore the eight of his nine lives that he lost while escaping fellow outlaws Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and Big Jack Horner (John Mulaney), who are also trying to reach the star.

Tommy Swerdlow and Tom Wheeler's story has both brains and heart, while Paul Fisher, as a co-screenwriter, puts a soul into it. Practically, a film is supposed to be imaginative, especially if it's an animated feature flick. Isn't Puss in Boots 2 a perfect example of imagination with a perfect blending of life lessons? Yes, it is. You know, some netizens say that DreamWorks is cracking the Pixar formula in their own style. I guess it's true. An adventure drama with emotions and a beautiful message indicates so. I should give credit to the writers and screenwriters for enhancing the viewing experience with their skills. They say half the battle is won on paper; here is the reason why they say it. There is something for everyone of all age groups, which doesn't happen with every animation film you know.

The big voice cast of Antonio Banderas, Salma Hayek Pinault, Harvey Guillén, Florence Pugh, Olivia Colman, Ray Winstone, Samson Kayo, John Mulaney, Wagner Moura, Da'Vine Joy Randolph, and Anthony Mendez is sweet with outcomes and different dialects. That's one of the easiest jobs in the world of animation, but it has to be done carefully. Some characters are too sweet here, which is unacceptable, but of course, how can someone hate the positivity? Even if it's too difficult to believe. Nevertheless, there is a message behind it, and it's not that intricate to understand. You are gonna enjoy that process and the results that follow.

DreamWorks almost hit a hundred dollar budget for the sequel that was late for its generation of audience, leaving everyone worried about the profits. Well, I must say, they spent where it was due. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is one of the most stunning visual spectacles ever produced by DreamWorks Animation for under $100 million. The action sequences are breathtaking, and the 3D effects are marvelous. Animation doesn't really require 3D viewing unless you have something special to show. Here, you have that something special coming in the first 10 minutes only. Also, the middle and climax portions of the film are visually gorgeous.

I wished for a better use of the background score, which remained average. The editing is misjudged in the first half but pretty smooth in the latter half of the film. Joel Crawford is just 5 years old as a director with 3 films in his kitty, and Puss in Boots 2 suddenly takes him to the next level. This is, by far, his best work till date, and I am excited to see how ""far far away"" he goes in the future. As a whole, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is a perfect family film for the holiday period; however, Indians have to see it almost a month later. Does it really matter as long as you are spending the money on something that is worth it?

RATING - 7/10*","18 January 2023",7,0,1
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","One of the best films of the year, one of the best animated films of the last several years, and a welcome and unexpected enthralling return to the world of stories of Dreamworks Far Far Away. Myself, my wife and my teenage daughter actually had the good luck to see this a month ago, right after Thanksgiving, but I forgot to review it. The story is complex, both structurally and philosophically. It brings in some surprising darkness into the Puss in Boots/Shrek film world while keeping it grounded in its imaginative, kid-friendly exploration of fairy tale legends. It never feels redundant to the previous films or a rehash of what the characters did before. It explores real character growth. At the end, I was really excited by the idea of a 5th Shrek film and what this kind of complexity could do for one. I was going to rate this 9 out of 10, but I realized I couldn't think of any way it could be improved upon, so there's no reason why it shouldn't be 10/10. I hope it makes enough money to encourage a new Shrek film.","29 December 2022",10,2,4
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","I have been waiting for this movie for so long and when I watch it I think director took right time to gift us this masterpiece what a movie it was fun to spend 1 hour 40 minutes on this movie I love 2 characters from this movie very much first wolf was one of the scariest villainin in animated movie I have ever watched in my life and 2nd dog perrito charcter was also amazing it shows you should always be calm in every situation and always be good to others and god will always help you in your difficult times and every other thing in this movie was also perfect from starting to end this movie was best animated movie ever created and it deserves oscar and Disney should learn from DreamWorks animation how to create great movie like this one.","22 January 2023",10,1,1
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","It is rare to find a sequel that is just as good as the original, but this one pulled it off.

What a great show to take the family to. It was so refreshing to see a movie aimed at children that just told a good story and didnt needlessly force an agenda (that is far above their heads and the age rating) that has nothing to do with with the story into it like Disney and Pixar does now on every release. I dont even know any parents that are comfortable letting their children watch Disnar movies anymore without watching them first, and that is beyond sad.

Take notes Disney and Pixar, since you obviously have no clue anymore, but this is the good enjoyable entertainment that families want to see.","28 December 2022",10,2,4
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","I'm glad I *didn't* take my younger kids to see this. I would not recommend this film for young children.

The big bad wolf appearing throughout the film is quite a dark/scary character, combined with the overall themes around death.

The other 'bad guy' characters (Jack Horner, Goldilocks and The Three Bears) are quite sinister in parts.

There are several jump-scare moments, suspenseful scenes and fight scenes with dramatic SFX.

There is some humour to offset the darkness, but this is definitely not the bright and happy comedy movie you'd expect from the Dreamworks / fairytale / Shrek spin-off franchise.","7 January 2023",5,5,16
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","Amazing artwork, beautiful animation with excelent movement, thought provoking and deep themes, great character design, cool worldbuilding, fair stakes and overall a good concept.

But then... the goddamn childish jokes and horribly lazy dialogue just killed it for me. I can understand that childrens movies cannot have too much subtext or the children wont understand... but for gods sake you dont have to have so many lame jokes, stupid jokes... you are making kids dumber than they are.

Also the pacing was a bit off too. It would have been a cool 8 episode anime, but right now it was too rushed..","16 January 2023",4,3,10
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","What a story. What a villain. What an experience. 4chan recommended this movie and boy am I glad I saw it. I haven't seen such an amazing, bone-chilling villain in such a long time. What an emotional story that has such cuteness overload and heartbreak intertwined perfectly. This is a must watch movie. Dreamworld hit it out of the park with this one.

I only saw shrek 1 and 2 which I absolutely adore. This movie has an awesome message even if the laughs aren't as good. The story of an adventurer facing retirement. It's a story that brings some Don Quixote vibes but also resonates with what I imagine old people feel as society tells them to stop living life and go to nursing homes.

Definitely going to see this movie again.","13 January 2023",10,2,4
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","How could I not love it.the animation is so beautiful and my favorite character doing there thing. Although I didn't expect much going into this film considering that it was a sequel and the original was released quite a bit ago. But I was not only pleasantly surprised but very stunned with both the story itself and the look of it. I honestly loved it. I will admit it is probably not everyone's cup of tea but it definitely was mine. I do think this movie is worth a watch if you are up to it and can be a fantastic family movie or friends movie especially if you all have watched sherk and all that follows. Can't wait to watch it again.","15 January 2023",10,2,3
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","The only reason i've seen this was because my children wanted to go. So i agreed. I didn't expect something good since most sequels are inferior to their predecessors and the first movie wasn't that great to begin with. So i was pleasantly surprised that this was a really good movie actually! Far better than the first one. Better story, more heart, and an amazing visual style! Yes! Even though its rendered it has a certain style to it that most visible in action scenes. But even in normal scenes it looks like a mix of rendering and painting. So visually there was nothing to complain. Almost perfect.

The story was also pretty good. It was completely free of woke elements and in its core it did focus on friendship and family. And it also had a real evil villain. There was even some great character development. Everything about the movie felt good. The best animation movie this year!","26 December 2022",8,1,4
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","Is movie was shot in 3D and it was an enjoyable show on several levels. The story is superior to previous Dreamworks movies and is even superior to the shreck movies. And the advantage is in the adult plot where very unusual elements appear in animated films such as death, redemption, love and payment for karma and the advantage of being naive at some moments in life. The characters that appear do not have much previous history and that ultimately helps the dynamism but also leaves holes in the story. There are characters that are not very appropriate for children, but the children of today are different from those of our time. It is a great animated film, recommended.","23 January 2023",9,0,0
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","We live in an era in which movies and tv/streaming series constantly bombard us with fake morals, emotional blackmail and empty content that insult both the intelligence and integrity of the viewer.

This movie is not one of those. For the first time in years you can sit back and relax watching a fun family movie that doesn't try to force an obvious political agenda on you. And I say obvious, because if this Puss in Boots movie has any political intentions, at least it is oblivious instead of being bad tasteful, without sacrificing the artistic legitimacy of the creators and the entertainment of the spectators like certain films.

Instead, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is a charming, funny and captivating family movie in every word. From the fantastic and stylish animation (which in moments of action reminds me of anime series) to the numerous healthy jokes that will make children and adults laugh to tears. I reiterate the animation, the film dares to use innovative techniques that at least I have not seen in western animated films, giving the film an exotic, wacky and cool style that fits perfectly with the personality of Puss in Boots.

Moreover, something that I really liked is the representation of the cultures that inspired the film. Besides the mandatory fairy tales refferences, the film is itself a fantastic pastiche of Hispanicity, from flamenco pieces to graceful Latino accents and coloquial language, all done with impeccable taste and detail.

Finally I will say that the message of the film is beautiful. It could be said that it manages to break certain stereotypes in a convincible way and at the same time promote conservative (and universal) values, something with which everyone can identify.

Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is one of the best animated movies I've seen in many years, a must see for all fans of animation and good comedy. I hope that the success of this film will inspire other producers to make more movies with heart like this, movies that do not seek to victimize or blame anyone. That's right, I'm talking to you, Disney.","17 January 2023",9,1,3
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","Just when you think you really know what to expect and that nothing can surprise you any more, life taeches you lessons.

This movie is one such little lesson.

I gave up hope on big Hollywood animated studios to make any true great movie any more.

And even while Dream Works didn't degrade nearly as bad as Pixar, and Disney's Encanto was really good and actually made me almost tear up at one point, in the end it left that feeling of a perfectly calculated, executed and polished product above all else.

But Puss in Boots: The Last Wish leaves the feeling of genuine creative inspiration and love.

It radiates brilliance.

The noble, positive story delovered through absolutely deligtful animation (which itself is a technically and artistically novel and perfectly welcome combination of the standard high definition rendering with a soft ""cell shaded"" layer on top of it) made me pause and smile, laugh and gaze at the visual experience throughout.

The character design and facial animations are sublime, and Jack is by far the most strikingly designed animated villain I've ever seen.

All in all, I just want to express my admiration and congratulate to everyone involved in making this gem.","9 January 2023",10,1,2
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","Puss in boots was fun, exciting and deep. Better than i expected. I liked how they addressed mental health and therapy with the dog and how death coming for puss in boots was a metaphor for anxiety.

I thought the animation was great. It had a fast style and the fighting scenes were cool like kung fu panda. It had nothing to do with shrek but is a great story in its own right. I don't have children so i don't know what it would be like to take them and watch it together but as an adult i thought it was great.

Funny and my girlfriend loved it too. Last few scenes really brought everything together. Cheers.","26 December 2022",10,3,5
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","Great voice acting, animation every character is quirky, distinguished and likable like puss'es beard. Surprisingly villain was very likable too, action sequences are well done and flows.

It would be great if we get to see some old characters but not complaining.

And for some reason I have to write an essay of 600 words to review which seems dumb and it might also discourage many people wo write reviews this long because no one wants to write review this long.

But I really appreciate people who come here and write a review and making helpful for all of us.

How is this still not 600 words??","16 January 2023",9,2,3
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","I really loved the characters, side characters, plots, adventure, the many competitions. The animations. Plot progression and timing. I liked the fairy tale and story links. I really liked to see how the main character learned and grew and learned from the past. The movie was perfect in some ways.

The main character, the cat, learned and grew so much and realized his mistakes and changed. I learned a lot from it.

I want to see the movie again. I loved the visuals of the animations too.

The main character was annoying at first but that was the point. To see him progress and change. Great movies.","1 January 2023",10,1,3
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","I loved this movie and so did my autistic friend I watched it with at the cinema. My friend gave it 5 out of 6 stars withdrawing one star because ""cats are not supposed to talk!""
I loved the villains in the movie. The wolf was scary enough for my autistic friend to start talking out loud that this wolf is ""not nice!"" The baker villain is also scary as well as comical and absurd. The girl and the bears also have important lessons for us, the viewers. Of course, the movie is totally brilliant technically and the music is wonderful and enhances the story which is solid and void of politics and idiology. The story wants to give us important lessons about life and entertain with action, drama and comedy at the same time.","20 January 2023",10,0,0
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","No joke. Wildly entertaining animation & dynamic storytelling make for one impressive cinematic adventure: The Last Wish was probably the most fun I've had watching a film since PG: Psycho Goreman.. It's platinum-solid family affair with tons of in-jokes, expertly crafted dialogue, & pitch perfect performances from its actors. I did not expect nor desire to enjoy this movie as much as I did, & indeed I would watch it again. Highly recommended for fans of other instant classics such as The Brave Little Toaster, Zazie dans le Métro, Birdboy: The Forgotten Children, Boris & Natasha, The Girl Who Leapt Through Time, or A Bug's Life. Ok love you, be safe out there & Super perfundo on the early eve of your day.","9 January 2023",10,1,2
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","Dreamworks really know how to nail their sequels. With Shrek 2 and How To Train Your Dragon 2 being better then the first. They really know how to see the room for improvement that is left behind by previous movies and expanding on them in very interesting and inventive ways. With Puss in Boots making his first apperance in Shrek 2 almost 20 years ago now, he has been a very popular support character in the Shrek franchise with a memorable voice performance by Antonio Banderas, he was bound to get his own standalone movie sooner or later. Eventually in 2011, one year after the supposedly final Shrek movie was released, the self titled Puss in Boots was released to mediocre reception. In my opinion it was a bit to weak and not very memorable when it came to Dreamworks productions at that stage and lost some of the charm that the Shrek movie were known for. It wasn't a terrible or even really that bad of a film. But it felt pretty throwaway that left a lot to be desired.

The thing that makes Puss in Boots: The Last Wish so much better than the first, is that this felt purley like a passion project than a character cash in which is what the first one felt like. It is obvious that an insane amount of passion went into this movies direction, animation, writing and voice acting to make the movie as entertaining as possible aswell as giving us a few things that we haven't seen before.

First off, the animation in this film is gorgeous. This type of cel shaded and traditional 3D hybrid style really fits this film and leaves me wondering if this is the type of style that Dreamworks Animation will stick with from now on, or they will do something different again with their next production. It is also incredibly vibrant and detailed in certain shots. I also like how many of the fighting and action scenes put the characters in this lower frame rate choppy but kinetic style of movement which worked very well when it was used.

Antonio Banderas has never sounded better as Puss and every supporting actor knocked it out of the park aswell. Kitty makes a return aswell and she is utilized much better here than in the previous movie but the biggest surprise of this movie was the new character called Burrito. Whoever voiced him did a fantastic job and is the best new Dreamworks character in a very long time! You would think his infectious niceness would get old really fast, but they use it very well and he is actually pretty multi layered and gets a lot of laughs. I think he is in the realm of superniceness which is a term from reading a Richard Dawkins book a few years back where he said that being overloaded with the perk of niceness and kindness is a perversion of darwinism from a scientific standpoint. Though he also said that these kind of people don't bother him and wishes there were more types of people in this world. Burrito as a character symbolizes this type of person in my opinion.

The humor in this movie is actually really good aswell and a bit edgy with a lot of bleeped swearing which lets your mind fill in the blanks without it breaking it's family rating which I thought was really smart. And there were quite a few good visual gags aswell.

I do have to talk about the villans in this movie because there is more than one, and they all play off eachother basically perfectly and it really shows how smart Dreamworks have become at crafting origional villans. The character of 'Death' is the scariest and most menacing family film villan I have seen in a long time and I was surprised at how hard they pushed him as a character, because he's not really a typical villan but the embodiment of a dark concept, a force of nature.

Overall I thought it was a brilliant animated sequel which took more risks than what I've seen in a very long while in the Western animation industry. Absolutley fantastic!","12 January 2023",10,1,2
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","Went into the film expecting nothing extraordinary, but I came out pleasantly surprised by how good it actually was. The story was charming and the writers managed to make me actually care about the characters (which is something that's not always achieved even in adult films). I wasn't sure if I liked the animation style at first but it grew on me after I saw how well the action scenes mingled with the other scenes. I also loved all the cheeky Disney film Easter eggs that were just specific enough to make you realize they're referencing those films without explicitly violating copyright laws (bravo, DreamWorks). To top it all off, the writers actually managed to find a balance between kid and adult humor. I, a 24-year old grad student, genuinely laughed out loud at a children's film and I'm not ashamed to admit it, because DreamWorks didn't go the ""let's pander to all the kids without any consideration for the adults in the room"" route. Overall, a pretty decent film with fun storytelling and a good message.","28 December 2022",9,2,4
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","The art in this movie is FANTASTIC, especially the backgrounds that look hand painted, are they hand painted? I love almost every aspect about this movie the ONLY thing i dont totally love is SOME of the character design, i love goldi, jack looks like a dreamworks villain and that works well (also why does he look like hes made of jello?), but the therapy dog (who i dont totally know the name of im watching it for the second time right now) is a little off somehow? I feel like the eyes are too big as kind of a cheat-y way to make it cute you know? Honestly i would have loved it way more if the eyes were like overly small. Its just a personal change i would make. But none of that matters because theres cats in this movie and i love cats :)","18 January 2023",9,1,2
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","I think this is the best animation movie of the year. Amazing job as usual by DreamWorks Team. Mesmerizing views and story!

The animations first of all is just so amazing (modern styled)-it really got me to the edge of my seat looking at the flashes and the bright colours. And there were the antagonists which were AMAZING especially Big Bad Wolf. I mean haven't seen any other movie where the villain makes a cool-spooky entrance (it literally gave me chills). The comedy and jokes were also pretty fun to watch and listen to it.

And thats why if you're a big fan of comedy/drama/fantasy/adventure/magic check this movie out and see it for yourself.

Always been a Shreks Franchaise Fan. Its good too see they've really done justice to this franchaise as well.

Can't wait for new advenrure of Puss In Boots!

Puss in Boots : The Last Wish 😽
Best Animated Movie of The Year 🏆","6 January 2023",10,4,6
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","Now I know that the top animation studios want mass production and marketable characters. The billions of dollars they bring in should mean that there's at least some heart in the mass production. In a world where animation has literally peaked with graphics and realism you have two options to stay in the game: 1:Great storytelling and originality, and 2: Stylize the crap out of your movies. While Disney has definitely brought in some stylization primarily with Luca and then turning red, the story writing is still lacking. Dreamworks looked at those two options and said ""why not both"". Bad guys is another great example of this. Studios need to realize that the animation community isn't just for kids, and when they produce films like Spiderverse where all the animation nerds make YouTube videos on the freaking frame rate, there is a business in styling your movies. Also I noticed how recently there hasn't been a token ""cute character thst sells well"" in the recent dreamworks movies. They fully focused into making unique character designs, even if it meant not getting the toy sells. Puss in boots has great writing, excellent character arcs, hell my parents laughed, my young cousins laughed, and my teenage siblings laughed. EVERYONE laughed. The textures are amazing, the world building is incredible, character design is immaculate, it feels very alive. It wasn't an over saturation of color like most mass productions are, which real atmosphere being created. Voice acting was incredible. The soundtrack was incredible and yes, the fight scenes were incredible. Honestly if you love animation, or even if you don't, see this movie. If we want to see studios do more of this (like spiderverse and bad guys) we need to show interest. Well done Dreamworks.","8 January 2023",10,1,2
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","The first thing I noticed was how they had changed the animation. I guess some people like it. But the choppy and poorly detailed animation style made famous by into the spider verse has made its mark. But there is quality here too visually.

The annoying part: it's a bit too jokey. I know it's a kids movie but it doesn't need to be a joke like you snap a finger. The dog? He's too annoying and over the top. I guess for contrast.... So that's the bad part.

The good part? Wonderful voice acting through and through. Great soundtrack and the best of all, a great villain! They spared no expense making the antagonist in this movie.

Antonio Banderas is a legend! He is.... Puss in boots!","21 January 2023",8,0,3
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","An amazing buildup on the world first introduced to us in 2001, with not only stunning new locations, but also colorful and interesting characters and ofcourse a plethora of phenomenal stories. When I left the theater I was left wanting more of that world. I can be lost in the visual representation of the animated world for ages. Every character only adds to the main plot and deserves a full story of their own.

I hope that this movie is Dreamworks saying ""We are here to stay"" as one of the greatest animation companies out there. I hope this movie is an omen of what Dreamworks have in store for us in the future and that their glory days are up to come.","10 January 2023",9,2,3
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","This movie caught me off guard 100%. Went with a buddy of mine to see this more as a joke but also just to pass the time. We (19M and 22M) just wanted to hang and chose to see this movie. There were numerous times we were bursting out laughing and also moments we understood deeply and connected to our emotions. I think the animation, while maybe a little too similar to spider-man, was still phenomenal. The bright colors used and the background artwork was amazing. Definitely not expecting that. Also the story was beyond amazing. Way better than it's predecessor and other animated movies released in 2022.

As guys who grew up watching the Shrek franchise, I for one am excited to see what's next.","10 January 2023",10,3,4
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","Puss in Boots: The last wish does what few sequels manage to do and that's create a follow up story that expands the characters while telling a good story.

The Last Wish starts off with Puss engaged in his antics before facing down a very serious, and kind of frightening foe. In searching for a way to fight this for, he comes across great past charactyand fantastic new faces that enhance the Shrek/Puss in Boots world.

This movie uses adult themes but delivers them in an action packed, fun way. The humor lands and the heartwarming moments work. With out giving the film away, what more could you ask for? Also, the animation style is fantastic (very inspired by Into the Spider verse).","23 January 2023",9,0,0
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","I am not a critic and I rarely consider movies to be great. But damn dreamworks nailed it with this movie. Characters were phenomenal, the story is fantastic and the overall experience was just so refreshing. This is better than the usual generic animated movies we are getting nowadays, and it mainly has something to do with Dreamworks willingness to push the movie to have bizzare and dark characters such as the wolf (I wont name him - he is one of the best things about this movie) and Jack Horner which are villains who are equally great but gives off different vibes.

It has been a long time since I've smiled almost throughout a movie, not because of quips or jokes every 5 minutes that tend to get old very fast, I smiled through the movie because of its high quality delivery of a great plot that never feels too congested and I think that all characters actually had great development within a movie that is less than 2 hours total.

I hope this would be the standard of animated movies going forward as other studios such as Pixar has become quite stale and generic lately.","17 January 2023",10,2,4
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","Dreamworks really made something great here. The animation is similar to Spiderman into the spiderverse movie. It looks gorgeous. Animations are over the top and fluid. You feel them!

The story is solid, no spoilers here! Main baddies (yes, plural) are both intimidating and well made.

Goldilocks story made me tear up. I'm grown up man and its weird, but on 2 occasions i felt my eyes got wet. The moral of the story is well.. kind of cliche, but there's so much you can do to reinvent a wheel. The way how they got to it though. Gooood stuff, really.

I'm happy to see Dreamworks picking up where Disney has stumbled and fell. No politics. No propagandas. No hidden (hidden as well as hammer to the face) messages. Just lots of fun!

Should you wa-YES. Definitely go watch it. I cant wait for whatever they will come up next!","7 January 2023",9,0,1
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","I went in high as a kite thinking this will be a good time in the movies and my goodness i was wrong. I had a fantastic time! I've never seen an animated villain so cool since Kung fu panda trilogy. This has got to be the best animated villain I've ever seen.

The story is way more dark and serious than the trailers would make you believe. And because of that, you actually feel for Puss and the rest of the characters. The pup is again a fantastic match for the cat and something so obvious I'm surprised it wasn't done sooner but glad it was done so well.

The secondary villain too was waay smarter than an animated family film usually serves. The action sequences, the animation style, the music, all fantastic! Even the fairy tale references are at par with those from the first Shrek.

I really want to watch this film once again!","19 January 2023",8,0,1
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","Alright story, but this spiderman/anime crap shouldn't be fitted into the magical Shrek universe, part of my childhood got hurt with this on 2s laggy animations and oil paintings, comic book effects.

I understand the team got inspired by the spiderman into thr universe, but it doesn't fit into the Shrek universe.

Most of us who grew up with Shrek loved its hidden gems and adult jokes, especially now that we ourselves are adults.

I wish they bring back the writters from the first two shrek movies to write on any related story in this specific universe. Also being back that lady who picked out songs for the Shrek movies, she is amazing at finding great fitting music.

Either way it's a bit disappointing for me.","10 January 2023",6,5,14
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","Solid storyline that's great for kids. It was a little scary for my 5 year old daughter but just scary enough to be cool for my 7 year old son. Though both liked it enough to pay attention the whole time without getting bored - which is half the reason we take our kids to the movies.

The animation is really great. It reminds of of when Disney's Tarzan was a blend of CGI and animation that had never been seen before. Puss in Boots looks like a combo of CGI, animation, anime and at parts even looked like claymation.

I didn't find the movie overly humorous but it was funny enough. The movie had a very ""epic"", LOTR feel to it.","5 January 2023",9,1,4
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","The way the whole movie is animated it amazing, especially seeing it on the big screen this movie was non stop fun and I was not bored at all.

Great to see a Shrek character develop and would recommend this film for adults and kids alike. Voice acting was superb as well shout out Antonio Banderas and Salam Hayek.

All in all this is a well animated movie with a great fun story and voice acting and would recommend you go and see this! (especially if you are a Shrek or Dreamworks fan you will not be disappointed) They did a great job with the art style and the story deffo go and see it it soon!","17 January 2023",10,4,6
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","The Last Wish's breakneck-pace comedy scenes come off as a bit hyperactive for my tastes, maybe because of just how much it's cramming into its 1 hour, 40 minute runtime, but when it wants to be, it is chillingly good. The best scenes are honest to god 10/10 material, executed to near-perfection. In an age when so many animated kids' films always feel the need to make villains somehow sympathetic or relatable to the audience, here we get some real monsters that get to be unapologetically fun and bloodthirsty. And because of that, we get a hero who feels genuinely imperiled. The film is smart. From its absolutely madcap opening sequence that makes Puss in Boots out to be an invincible Looney Tunes cartoon character, we then get a killer introduction to the movie's big bad who doesn't play by those same wacky rules. Puss has his whole world turned upside down in one gripping life or death fight sequence, and must learn for the first time what it means to be a legend who can actually live up to the high, prideful standard he's set for himself. It takes guts to stand up to terror and truly gamble everything one values-there is a subtle morality that infuses the hero's journey here which feels straight out of the most classic spaghetti westerns. But the emotions expressed come off as much stronger and more genuine for our vulnerable protagonist. His journey really brings out his kindness, understanding, fear, depression, and truly epic bravery which might be enough to move you to tears (amazing range from Antonio Banderas here). And it looks and sounds eye-wateringly gorgeous at times, with bits that beg to be paused and admired on re-watch. This is a great movie and one that absolutely deserves all the love (and word-of-mouth hype) it's been getting. I highly recommend you check it out for a vivid, gag-loaded swashbuckling fantasy with a heart of gold.","22 January 2023",9,1,1
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","Amazing animated movie from dreamworks, this and the good guys are showing us that Dreamworks is in a renaissance, best movie in the Shrek universe since shrek 2 and you know how good is that 2004 movie, Antonio Banderas And the hottie Salma Hayek have a very good chemistry, The dog character is funny not as much as the legendary Eddie Murphy as donkey of course, the Villains are all entertaining specially the dead wolf played exceptionally by Wagner Moura is scary and very threatening, the bears and goldilocks are very funny and wholesome, and my favorite character in the movie John mulaney as the Jack motherfucer Horner is amazing, greatest villain since the fairy godmother, i cried with ghe anxiety's scene with perrito scene, i suffer anxiety attack all the time so is easy for me to feel related to that, anyways stop with the sadness, amazing movie and congratulations to Crawford for making another great sequel.","19 January 2023",9,0,0
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","Eleven years since the solo premiere of Puss in Boots comes the premiere of the long-awaited sequel to the animated film about that character we learned to love from Shrek 2. In a wonderful sequel that makes worth all the wait we've had for throughout these years.

The magic of DreamWorks Animation is back.

A special joy is what brings me back to the arena of the studio that was able to bring us Shrek more than two decades ago, although the studio has never ceased to be present, it is with the second installment of Puss in Boots that I have felt again. That the magic of the studio returns to the ring and it does so with a wonderful film that still brings us perfect entertainment for young and old alike who will equally enjoy an adventure that leaves us with great messages and above all a vibrant visual enjoyment.

A story that entertains you from beginning to end without stops. It is a fairy tale without nuances that captivates you at all times with a story full of magical moments and reflections on how we appreciate our life and how we stand in front of it, without ceasing to reflect on everything we have and do not value.

It has all the arguments of that always efficient hero's journey that touches our heartstrings with each adventure that unfolds as the story progresses. The integration of genuine characters allows that message and journey to end up being much more special, because they are the perfect condiments for us to enjoy with all the love, a simple but fulfilling story that takes us to the Dreamworks Animation of yesteryear and that is the best news that we can receive.

In the right hands.

Joel Crawford continues to hit the right direction and brings us refreshing and innovative animation that sets a new standard for competing studios. The animation is a real past that mesmerizes both for adults and children, with colorful settings and handling of action sequences that makes it clear that we are in the presence of a first-rate visual spectacle.

A perfect script, with a development executed with tweezers and the management of humor and sensitivity, with all the greatness of knowing how to deliver what you want and being clear about it, without leaving precedents for dead moments within what we are seeing.

Conclution

The perfect animated film of the year 2022 and the mark that DreamWorks Animation has returned forcefully and what better way to leave us that gift that makes us dream of the return of that character that you are all waiting for again.","8 January 2023",9,0,1
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","I watched the original Puss In Boots the day before seeing this one and I think I would have enjoyed this a lot more if I hadn't. The story and characters were fine, but there was a noticeable drop in quality of the animation and cinematography. Firstly the animations style had added clear Manga influence. Especially in the fight scenes which often had that flying background, stuttered amazon that Manga uses. The second issue I had was that the final rendering had obviously had a paint effect applied. As if each frame had been hand painted rather than 3D rendered. The result dropping a lot of the quality and detail that the original film had. If it hadn't been for both of these issues I would have given this film a much higher rating, but together it felt like a cheaper, less finished film than the original.","22 December 2022",4,18,113
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","The writing and character development in this movie is phenomenal. The voice acting is the best you will see in animation. This movie has everything, it really does. Most people won't give this movie credit because it is a Puss in Boots movie but it has such creative storylines it is unbelievably enjoyable for everyone. My kids loved it, my wife and I loved it.

Might actually go see it again in theaters. The build up of all of the characters in this movie is wonderful. While at the same time they give them all their instinctual animal traits. John Mulaney's character was such a perfect and creative villain.","11 January 2023",10,3,4
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","The movie is fun. It felt like the animated movies from my childhood: lighthearted and timeless. It wasn't groundbreaking by any means, but it was one of the first times in a while that I went to a movie for the sake of entertainment and actually was entertained.

The story was also fairly interesting also; I liked the addition of new fairytales that we hadn't seen before in the Shrek universe. Overall I think it added depth to Dreamwork's' filmography, and was a great follow up to the first Puss in boots movie which was such a fantastic film.

The movie was also fairly funny, but I do have to say that Harvey Guillen's character Perrito was annoying to me. The character felt forced and was just overly ""cute"" which felt tiring after a while, but it is a kids film so its not too big a deal.

So with that said this is still the type of movie that someday when I have kids I won't actually mind showing them despite it being being made in the era of dead art and overly greedy Hollywood execs. It's fun, it's cute, and I think in general a step in the right direction for animated movies that can be enjoyed by all.","2 January 2023",7,1,4
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","This movie is simply incredible. It has an amazing combination of emotions, humor, and stunning animations that can make you both laugh and cry. I honestly believe it surpasses Shrek in its quality. Dreamworks has done an exemplary job here, and I'm hoping to see more of their work in the future. Puss in Boots was an especially delightful surprise, and I'm looking forward to seeing more of him in future productions. I don't often take the time to write reviews, but this movie definitely deserved one. Antonio Banderas was also spectacular in his role. In conclusion, I wholeheartedly recommend this movie and believe that it's an absolute must-watch.","10 January 2023",10,2,3
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","The overwhelming positive reviews tell me one of three things: 1) There is a secret, better version of this film that I didn't watch, 2) Dreamworks paid for hundreds of bot reviews, or 3) most people's bar for American animated films is so low it might as well be in the ground. Suffice it to say, this movie absolutely did not live up to the hype. Puss in Boots 2 is not only NOT as amazing as everyone is saying it is, is actually a pretty bad movie. Mediocre at best. If you love animated movies then go watch one of the movies that made you fall in the love with the medium again. This movie does not deserve your money. Watched on December 27, 2022.","28 December 2022",2,26,100
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","Honestly I had little hope for this movie after the 1st, but seeing the trailer showing a new a fresh animation style got my interest.

The animation and sequences steal the show. I have never been this entertained by an animated movie's action scenes, it is actually that good. The action feels fast and does not linger on anything that does not add to the fun.

The story itself is nothing too special or crafted, but it does not mess up what is a great movie. The characters are very good and I was motivated every scene they were in, it felt like they spent time at every stage asking themselves ""does this need to be in the move?"".

I also love Jiminy Cricket, I was surprised that I laughed at this movie, and it was because of him.

I hope the possible future movies in this storyline are just as creative and fun.","31 December 2022",7,2,5
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","I'm incredibly shocked by Dreamworks and how they animated this movie, the colors the designs of the characters! I loved all of it. I'm not going to lie, I came into this movie thinking that it's not gonna be that good. Normally sequels don't always beat the original. This one certainly did. It goes hard with its theme and I think it does a great job with it. The villains are well made and one in particular is down right terrifying, arguably one of the best villains I've seen in a long time. I feel like this is a movie that both kids and adults can watch! Great job Dreamworks, I can't wait to see more from you!","8 January 2023",9,2,3
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","While the earlier films (going back to the first ""Shrek"" in 2001) had a rubbery CGI style that typified the form in the early aughts, it hasn't aged particularly well. New director Crawford borrows a page from 2018's Oscar-winning ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" and DreamWorks' own ""The Bad Guys"" from earlier this year to give a stylized, dynamic approach to ""The Last Wish"" that imbues the proceedings with a whole new energy.

There are several digressions - occasionally uplifting and oftentimes uproarious - as each group attempts to claim the Wishing Star, all with very different plans if they get it. Goldilocks, for example, wants everything to be just right, which might be positively endearing were it not for the fact that she sounds like a cockney gangster out of a Guy Ritchie movie.

Of course, the most important part of the mix is the man whose dulcet tones carry us along on this fractured fairy tale. Banderas is in fine form as his animated alter ego, clearly having lost none of his affinity for the role in the intervening decade and change. Quick, someone convince Banderas to reprise his other iconic sword-slashing hero as well!

How things culminate in ""Puss in Boots: The Last Wish"" isn't exactly surprising. But in true storybook fashion, the script by Paul Fisher and Tommy Swerdlow offers enough swerves to make the journey worthy of the destination. It's a perfect package of whimsy, sass and sweetness. Based on where this one ends, the filmmakers are no doubt already at work puzzling out Puss' next cinematic offering, and here's hoping it's not another 11 years before we see it.","30 December 2022",10,2,4
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","Puss in Boots: The Last Whish is the kind of movie that makes a menacing villain even with less screen time and that further more brings this aspect of threat to the viewer. The film has many good points, but the main one is its premise of putting family first and also the change of the main character, dropping his selfishness as the plot evolves, which makes the film split into acts, for example: fear of the unknown villain, development of the villains, family and more, not to mention the animation that, in my point of view, was simply perfect, this film is definitely one of the best animated films I've ever seen.","20 January 2023",9,0,0
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","It was funny and overall charming. I enjoyed the way they dug deeper I to Puss's character, he went from being very egocentric to admiring to needing help and being able to trust and be trusted by other. Goldilocks and the bears' accent was brilliant. Perrito is adorable, he was a very well written character. The movie, although appropriate, took a darker turn and I enjoyed, the wolf's whistle is terrifying, and t was overall more serious than many other children's movies. The voices are amazing, Salma Hayek, Antonio Banderas, and Florence Pugh did a great job. I expected it to be an okay movie, but I was agreeably surprised and thoroughly enjoyed it.","22 January 2023",9,1,1
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","What can I say? I'm a sucker for movies that don't take themselves too seriously. I grew up watching movies like Shrek and I still enjoy them today with my little ones. It's a shame that it took so long to come up with another version of Puss n boots but I'm glad they waited because this was very well done. The movie doesn't pull any punches with making fun of pretty much everyone at some point of the movie. It has simple life lessons that can be looked at not through a spectrum but as a whole, thus applying to everyone. I love that. There were several moments through the movie that I laughed out loud and I have to say it's been awhile since I've been able to do that during a kids movie. Usually I cringe and change the channel. I hope Dream Works continues to push that envelope and comes up with some new movies for my kids. We'll be first in line. Thanks Dream works for knowing exactly what we needed.","23 January 2023",9,0,0
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","Puss in Boots 2 is everything you expect from a school, but better, although it does not reach the point of Sherk 2 (Movie with which it will be compared) I must say that it is exquisite in every way, the characters are a delight, I can not believe that in 1 hour 40 minutes they have done something better, something incredible, something interesting to the point that he made me say ""This with Pinoccho del Toro must be the standard of animation"" I must say that Dreamworks does something that Disney does not.

Dreamworks makes movies with love, with brains and respecting children and adults, responing their intelligence, unlike Disney that thinks that we are all stupid and gives us the same garbage every year, because YES gentlemen Pixar is the only good thing of this company in most of the year. Congratulations, you have done the impossible and I respect this. You have to see this movie.","1 January 2023",10,1,4
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","This is no longer a children's cartoon. This is a powerful psychological drama. The search for the meaning of life, panic attacks, the battle with death itself. The cartoon will appeal to both children and adults. Children will laugh at funny moments. But adults will have a lot to think about. You can talk about the main villain forever. The wolf turned out super-charismatic. Cartoon impersonation of Christoph Waltz. When viewing, you get the feeling that you are in the cartoon universe of Quentin Tarantino's characters. The final scene will definitely not leave anyone indifferent. Definitely a recommendation to watch.","10 January 2023",9,2,3
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","First off, marry Christmas or Xmas to everyone on this long awaited project. My verdict for this movie is 9 out of 10, I felt that there was no indication on if we are going to have a Trilogy (Highly needed). I stayed in the theater hoping for a hint (Perhaps in my own view while there), but as far as entertainment concerned, thank you DreamWorks for making smile on Christmas, God bless.

Moving onto the plot, well written I'd say, from the introduction all the way to the conclusion of the film, it kept me on the edges of my chair, but I started to really pay attention on the development. Lot's of villain to enjoy, good vibes between Puss and his new friend, fun fun fun.

This is a great franchise and I highly recommend seeing this magnificent art, thank you.","26 December 2022",9,2,4
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","I am suprised about how good this movie actually turned out to be. I'm 20 years old and I never write reviews, but I felt like I have to. I'm sad that this movie is not getting the recognition it deserves, that's why I want to help out a little how I can hahahah This movie truly made me more emotional than Avatar 2 and it's a kids movie. It was dark but heartfelt, funny but serious. It was also interesting to see how accurate they potray panic attack, which I have not seen in children's movie before. Also the animation, it was so beautiful and artistic. The characters were great and the Puss in boots himself, had great character development. Overall, I loved everything except one tiny thing, the song after the movie did not fit and it sounded quite annoying, I'm not judgy about songs usually but it just threw me off a bit hahah but that's the only tiny flaw, that I don't think you can call it a flaw really, when everything else has clearly outshined it. So that's why I'm still giving 10/10 for this outstanding animation.","13 January 2023",10,2,3
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","If you haven't watched this film, do yourself a luxurious favor by gifting your eyes the pleasure of viewing this cinematic masterpiece. And the rest of this review is just gonna be random because it needs 400 more characters. Sorry. It starts now, and it will take about an L for the next few weeks before it gets too late for the rest the year for the next one in my opinion on this project and I hope it works for the next couple months and I will get it to the point I am going with a more solid foundation that will allow the rest to go away in a couple months or two months time to be fully healed... there sorry :)","16 January 2023",10,2,3
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","I am a 24yr old female who watched this with my 45yr old mother. Neither of us like animated kids films. You literally couldn't pay me to watch films like Finding Nemo, Monster House, Walle, etc. The only animated film I watch is Monster House and Polar Express once year 5yrs.

But some how the commercials really drew me into this movie.

This film had me and my mom laughing out loud like children!!! I could (and probably will) watch it 1-2 more times.

I gave it a 9/10 because the ending was just slightly boring for me.... But truly great film!!! Great comedy!

I would purchase this on DVD.

If you're doubting, go see it!!!!","15 January 2023",9,1,2
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","After years since anything new from the Shrek franchise graced the movie screen, DreamWorks jumps us back to the fairytale setting we know and love. While we end up following Puss in Boots instead of our favorite green ogre and his noble steed, Puss manages to take us on a fun adventure with references and fables we know with a twist on them.

Puss is living life as a great legend, but after a fight he finds his confidence shattered. Upon hearing of the Wishing Star, he goes off with Kitty Softpaws from the first Puss in Boots and a new side character to find it before his enemies do. Meanwhile, another character lurks in the shadows, who manages to strike fear into the fearless hero's heart. It's a race to see who can get the Wish, and who will betray who to get it.

Despite his appearance in other media, viewers don't have to have any reference to understand the plot and characters of this movie. There's a few cameos and easter eggs fans will pick up on, but the story itself is well contained.

Puss in Boots remains a lovable rouge who fights with immense style. Watching him fight and interact with all the characters is great to see, and is held up by the pace and style of the animation. There's tons of details animation buffs will enjoy and is quite unique and smooth even to the non-trained eye.

The story takes a little bit to get started, but it's a well paced film once it gets going. I found myself unable to look away from the screen even for a second, as did most of the audience I was watching with. Even pretty young kids in my viewing were glued to the screen and there was not any fidgets or whines coming from them. Everyone wanted to see what would happen next.

The movie is rated PG, though are some scenes and dialogue that danced the line as smooth as Puss's tap dancing. There's a group of characters created with a British flare, so don't be surprised if you hear them pushing it a bit. There's also a few themes dealing with mortality and fear, so parents or guardians taking their kids should definitely sit down with them afterwards and go over the movie with them. It may scare some kids, but I think a lot more will appreciate the message.

Overall, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is a fun, fast paced adventure featuring the best of Puss and a whole cast of new characters. There's a lot of heart, growth, and beautiful animation that can appeal to anyone, young or old. It's definitely a movie you want to see at least once on the big screen and definitely add to the Shrek collection.

If this is a glimpse of what Shrek 5 will be like, then Puss definitely sold me on it!","27 December 2022",9,1,3
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","What a big dissapointing movie! Me and my family loved part 1. But do not waste your time on part 2! It was way too dark for kids, horrifying. Also very cheap that it was 50% animation and 50% drawing effects. Just stick with animation, was very annoying and ugly too watch. Very sad they took this dark and weird turn with their movies, there was nothing wrong with how it was before.

You will lose a lot of fans over this.

We were watching this in the movies with are daughter who kept putting her hands in front of her eyes. This is really not suitable for kids, even though it should be a kids movie!","3 January 2023",1,15,147
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","Seriously, it's just perfect. The first episode was also entertaining, but the sequel just blew my mind. Puss in Boots just grown to be the best spin-off movies in the Shrek universe. The animation - which is slightly reminded me Into The Spiderverse, which I also love - is just candy for the eyes. The plot was well crafted, it just glued me to the screen. The character development of Puss is just spot on. Perfectly emotional, fun and filled with action. Well done DreamWorks. Looking forward what's coming up in the near future for them. If they manage to make Shrek 5 this much fun, DW will be the best animation studios out there imo.

Please go and watch it, this movie and DreamWorks deserves the support!

10/10.","5 January 2023",10,2,4
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","This was a CashCow ploy on the previous Shrek and Puss n boots movies.

It sucked, no wait It Suuuuuuckkkkked. This s..t looks like it was made from an iPhone. If Dreamworks is responsible for this, then everyone that used to be Dreamworks must not work for them anymore or they just totally lost touch of creativity. Also what is wrong with Selma H. Voice ? She sounds like shes not even trying, just trying to get a check and move on. No passion behind this character, its just blah blah blah, you can almost hear her say, ""Thats all Im giving you, you don't like then you get someone else""

Don't waste your time, Its a good thing I had this s..t on underground streaming.

Because I lost my time, but at least I kept my money. So F..off if you're mad at that.","15 January 2023",1,5,64
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","The first one was a master piece in my opinion, but this was rushed, rushed and rushed. They took out things that made the first one brilliant and everything moves at a pace of tremendous pace which means you don't get to know the characters and the speed is uncomfortable to watch.

The animation style was change and I think this new company really destroyed that which made the first one so good.

The story wasn't really something I could relate to either, it was detached from its true meaning and that kind of sums up the whole movie, discombobulated and lacking true meaning all of which the first movie had bucket loads of.","23 January 2023",5,0,3
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","Way better then the first one it's a interesting movie to watch you like how it feel everything about it. . Yeah that's true I think it's just like a new one lol but it's just like that one time with me and my family primo that's why I'm going on the other one lol and I'm so proud of you and you I can't wait to see what I can see what I mean by you doing right I don't want you in my mind I love that I don't know what to say but is it that you can talk about it and say that you don't have anything to do with that you don't know how you feel about that but you don't know how much I appreciate this movie it's amazing.","7 January 2023",10,1,3
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","This movie got all my attention during 1h43' thanks to the excellent script. Each character is unique in its own way, charming & attractive whether it is a villain or a hero. The most special is the little dog Perrito, who looks dazed but super cute with his philosophical sayings & a bright, warm heart. Although the film is for kids, it has many extremely meaningful messages for adults to reflect:
We can't love anyone if we only love ourselves.

Sometimes we already have what we wish for without even realizing it.

We don't need 9 lives like a cat, just live 1 life to the fullest.

I would have given this movie a 10/10 if it had had better soundtracks.","7 January 2023",9,1,3
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","I am surprised that on a tiring evening deciding to watch a fun animation took us on a ride that does not take itself seriously, but it is magnificently serious.

Swept away by the themes explored, I deeply relate to it, heck I even found solace and learned something from the simplicity in this complexity that I can take into my life.

As a seeker of better ways to animate that would enhance the ability of telling stories. I am glad to share that the mix of CGI, drawn images like painted and frame rate changes are truly unique. It is innovative not just in its techniques but how it has been used to show the range of expressions and details of each element of this journey.

"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","The movie was so wholesome and awesome, colorful and entertaining. Not a moment of boredom. Loved the new characters, loved the animation style and loved the simplicity of the story. Magical elements were so funny. Surprisingly violent and foul which only made it more compelling. Gotta say that my expectations were high but it did not disappoint. Easily one of the best animations nay best movies I seen lately. It is hard to deliver such a strong sequel story. Puss in boots himself had a strong character development and the villain made him even sweeter. And yes, even though the villain has to be the best animated villain I've seen for the past decade. For a animated sequel movie, it delivered! Big time!","7 January 2023",10,1,3
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","This is literally the best movie of 2022 and one of the best from DreamWorks. When I saw the trailer I could already tell that the animation was going to be amazing, and it completely blew my expectations away. Its an absolutely gorgeous movie.

From a story perspective it's also that good. There is the perfect number of characters, villains and friends. There isn't too much comedic relief or not enough, it's just exactly right.

I can only recommend this movie for everyone, no matter the age. It's just the perfect movie.

If you have the time to watch it, absolutely do, otherwise you'll miss the absolute best movie of this year.","16 January 2023",10,2,4
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","This film has renewed my faith in movie making. There are still some really talented people out there, there must be. This film is a testament to it. I was really taken aback by how good it was.

There is so much in this film, so many references, so many tangents it could well have veered off on, but it didn't. It held itself together perfectly.

All the characters were well rounded, remarkably so. I wouldn't be surprised if other films were made off the back of the rich pickings found in this film. By this I mean in regard to the attractiveness of the personalities it so clearly defined.

I haven't seen a film of this calibre for quite some time.

Well done.","7 January 2023",10,1,3
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","Finally! A kid's movie with a worth-it plot with great characters and a lesson. Seeing my childhood characters on screen again was so nostalgic and fulfilling! I was not a fan of the animation (comic book style, is it?) probably because I grew up seeing Puss in the Shrek style animation, but it was outstanding considering how animation styles have changed now. They need to make more movies like this again! (Disney Pixar take notes!) Not everything has to be modern social topics, politics or cupcakes and rainbows.

The ending was perfect as well! Brought back so many memories! Maybe we'll see Far Far Away in the near future! (HOPEFULLY)","18 January 2023",10,1,2
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","This movie is the best (kids) movies of 2022. The reason why I put ""kids"" in parentheses is because this movie can be enjoyed by both kids and adults alike. I am an adult that found this movie really good, funny, and heartwarming.

There are scenes that almost made me cry, and countless scenes that made me laugh. This story is also neatly constructed, with many characters and twists. Yet it doesn't feel bloated.

Not to mention the animation is amazing. It looks like a magical pop up book. It somewhat resembles Spider Verse, but it definitely takes its own twist on that type of stylization.

If you are an adult who saw the trailer and was worried about the dog character, worry no more. The dog wasn't annoying at all. He was endearing and had an actual purpose to being in the movie.

In conclusion, this movie is great. I've seen it twice now, and I don't regret it at all. I want it to make as much money as possible. You should too because it is phenomenal!!","9 January 2023",9,0,1
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","The trailers for this movie don't give it justice at all. The film starts out pretty playful but gets very serious really fast. The characters are awesome, the settings are vibrant, and the animation is gorgeous. Although, one character who is a wolf could be scary for very young children so I would be mindful of that. But I do have to say this is a major comeback for the franchise and nobody should over look it at all. The humor has the same bite to it as the original movies and the drama is awesome. Please go see this movie though. The theaters are very empty and we need more people to support so that a Shrek 5 may be more likely.

9/10, exceeds expectations.","29 December 2022",9,1,3
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","I honestly had no idea what to expect going in, through out the year i had dissapointment after dissapointment, with certain agendas being pushed and stupid side kick characters that are just plot devices to move the story forward. However this movie since the fist fight scene subverted all expectations and hooked me immediately. The movie overall was a touching meaningful masterpiece, so amazing i watched it twice. The Second time the movie hit harder in my opinion. As a person who doesnt really cry in movies...i had to be honest sometimes i just wanted to. The animation also was stellar and beautiful. I would recommend watching this movie.","16 January 2023",9,2,3
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","Was it just my theater? The action scenes appeared like they made fewer images so the movie seemed very jumpy. Did they run out of money to create the animation required? It was like they were trying to go anime style but it gave me a bit of motion sickness because it was so poorly executed. Still love Antonio Banderas! He and Selma Hayek made this movie great. The story had some scary moments in it for my 4 year old granddaughter but overall it's pretty tame as far as kids movies go. The other two granddaughters 6 & 8 seemed to enjoy it very much. I had hoped for an ending credits scene but there was none.","23 December 2022",6,6,51
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","This movie deserves the silver screen any time any ratings out there that are negative... you don't deserve good movies.

I will write 600 words just to fill out the minimum capacity for reviews here that I didn't know I needed but this movie is fantastic and I wish more people would go see it because not only is it a movie that ""oh my mom loves puss in boots"" it's a movie for people of all ages and a movie that really ""Moves-Me"". So yeah all kids would love this and I'm sure would be encapsulated by the design of which I ""WISH"" the studio and others will use more prevalently in further films bc the best CINEMATIC UNIVERSE is the SHREKAVERSE officially.","5 January 2023",10,3,6
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","I really thought this film was going to be a mediocre film like the first one. So my initial expectations were low. After seeing the film I would argue that is way better than Avatar 2 or really any film in 2022. This film tackles very heavy topics like anxiety, death, letting people down, and dealing with huge changes if your life. All the characters are humanized, visuals are better than Spiderman into the spiderverse, and I was rarely bored.

Another thing to consider if you are taking your kids to see this film, is that the film has a dark themes. However is still more suitable to watch with kids than 90% of the films currently out there.

So expect a roller coaster of emotions.

10/10.","11 January 2023",10,1,2
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","One of the best movie that released in 2022. I really enjoyed this movie even i never watched all of Shrek franchise neither first puss in boots movie. Somehow i never interested to those movie, then i just watched this movie and thankfully this is almost perfect.

Compared to another Dreamworks movie that realeased in the same year : the bad guys, this movie is just better in almost everything. There are not much plot twist, Big Jack Horner is a real bad guy, the wolf is just ""Death"" straight up, perito is an annoying, kind and dumb character and Goldi is another wish Hunter that make the movie just better. The animation is simply better. The story is Good, very easy to understand as the way it should.

Things that sadly miss in this film is the fighting scene especially when Jack Horner there. It's kinda too violence for a child movie.

Conclusion, it's one of the best animated movie especially that released recently, very easy to understand, good story, good character, good animation, very worth to watch.","12 January 2023",9,0,1
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","The Wishing star is a symbol of the ""fantasy"" that occupies a place in everyone's heart. Because life is not perfect, we fantasize about immortality, we fantasize about never being apart, we fantasize about never being defeated. Many of us spend our lives in vain for this fantasy, but we don't stop to look around us. What is the beauty and truth that is neglected?

Death, loss and failure are all things that we have to go through in our life. This story about the omnipotence of Wishing star and the non-existence of Wishing star tells us that nothing can help us avoid all these things. We can only accept, face and adapt to them with the spirit of our heart. The beauty of fantasy may not be so good, but the real beauty may be in the present, perhaps it is not too late, waiting for your discovery and embrace; Abandoned heart, insatiable, will come back to bite you.","10 January 2023",8,1,2
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","After watching the trailer I had really low expectations, but reading the reviews prompted me to watch it, and I'm so glad I did. Heart, Soul and humor, plus a smooth and creative animation experience that just shows the pinnacle of what DreamWorks is capable of.

As other reviews have mentioned, what makes this film shine is it's characterisation and their individual development, without losing track of the overall meaning of the film. It's not just another kids write off but also something meaningful for older animation lovers to enjoy as well.

Kudos.

TLDR: A touching start to 2023, with great characters a meaningful story line and proof that DreamWorks still knows what they are doing.","7 January 2023",9,2,4
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","Yet again another overhyped terrible animated film. No plot, no good characters, no fun or interesting villains, and terrible action scenes. I can already tell this film tried to copy into the spider-verse, but that was a very bad decision. If you want good action look at a movie like Batman and Robin a cinematic masterpiece. The wolf was just a character made for furries. You want a good villain? Go look at Hans from Frozen then you will know what a good villain is. Oh boohoo meow meow oh no only one life left I'm so scared. And what's even worse? No Shrek! 😡😡😡 I am not kidding when I say that I am truly ogre with these Puss in Boots movies. They somehow made this worse than the first one. At least with the first one and had a good twist villain, but this couldn't even deliver a good villain. And I can't stand when this film tries to be dark. If you want to know how to make a dark film then go look at Shrek the Third and Boss Baby. DreamWorks really needs to learn from their past mistakes such as Kung Fu Panda, Shrek one and two, and How to Train Your Dragon. They have finally been making good movies such as Boss Baby 1 and 2, but they just never learn from their mistakes. 😤","12 January 2023",9,1,11
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","I haven't seen any of the other Puss N Boots movies so can't compare but this one took me by surprise. We had been seeing the trailer for months and it looked mediocre. I honestly did not want to go see this but my 5yr old did so we went to go watch it and hands down one of the best movies I watched all year. The whole family enjoyed it and I would watch it again.

It's hilarious, has a great story, heartfelt, and just overall fun to watch. I loved how they brought back some old fairytale characters and it brought me back to my childhood. The best part is that it was under 2 hours and being 9 months pregnant it's hard to sit in one spot for too long so this was perfect.","4 January 2023",10,0,3
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","I went to the cinema thinking ""Is that movie that good? Lets find out shall we..."" after seeing all those videos, having absolutely no expectations whatsoever. Well let me tell you, it SLAPS hard. The visuals are intense, the colours are vibrant, the story is interesting, the villains are... FREAKING amazing. This movie honestly made me want more, like I was begging and hoping Dreamworks would make at least one more installment of that franchise. Now, to get into more detail, I want to mention the villains in particular. One of them is actually dreary and makes you feel anxiety, ultimately making you sympathise with the main character. It is so well done and well written that I actually shivered multiple times throughout the movie. And this is A PUSS IN BOOTS MOVIE! A kids movie, if you wish. Astounding, absolutely blew my mind. I highly recommend it to everyone, kids and adults alike, its pleasing to watch, the morals are good, there are jokes for both kids and adults, its just... Perfect. Take my word for it and visit the theaters as soon as you can, so the studio will make more like this...","22 January 2023",10,1,1
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","Okay let's just be honest. Puss in Boots 1 wasn't that good. It was lame, a bit boring and had a terrible villian. But Puss in Boots 2 is big step up. The storyline was amazing. It was Dark, Intense and Adventurous at the same time. It was only like an hour and forty minutes, but it was still pure entertainment. The villian, Death, based of the Big Bad Wolf, was horrifying. I do warn you there are jump-scares with Death in it. After all he is the sort of Grim Reaper. The other villians like Goldilocks and the Bears were great too. But not as good as Death, the best DreamWorks villian in my opinion. Can I just say, with Puss's therapy dog, the whole movie just gets 10x funnier. The animation is also pretty decent, though it resembles Into the Spiderverse animation style. Anyways, action is amazing, storyline extremely good and the villian, perfect just absolutely perfect. I strongly recommend watching this film if you like, well... Masterpieces. Young audiences may get jump-scared with Death's scenes, but it's just mild horror. And we'll that's it. Please have a Puss in Boots 3.","2 January 2023",10,0,3
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","I really loved it.

Every life matters. The action. The animation and the death character just amazing. Gave me goosebumps several times. The efforts on animation, the effects characters. Just amazingly amazing. Antonio sir I have been fan of yours since my childhood. Never missed a single movie of yours.

And you being the puss in boots made it even more amazing. The soft paws tremendous. Everyone played their role amazingly.

Just awesome.

I know how much efforts were their and I really do loved it.

It's not just a movie but a moral story if anyone could get it.

Life is a gift, have some value for that.

Lots of love to everyone
The cast,
The director
The singers, musicians,
Sound artists, video effects artists,
The graphics engineers,
The team

Stay blessed.","7 January 2023",10,1,2
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","I sat down not expecting much from the movie. Loved Shrek 1 and 2 but the sequels that followed along with the first Puss N Boots movie were average to below average, which set my expectations rather low.

However I found this movie highly entertaining. People will complain about the animation but it was a production choice to go the route they did...at first I wasn't sure about it but as the movie progressed I understood their choice and embraced it.

The story overall is great...family, living and loving the life you have, what more do we need. This coupled with the interweaving of the characters was smartly done. If you like me, watch animated movies to be entertained, have a few smart laughs along the way and smile when they are over...then I think you will really enjoy Puss N Boots The Last Wish.","7 January 2023",9,1,3
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","First things first, the animation looks incredible, with comic-book like aspects incorporating 3D animation with 2D effects, and character design that isn't ugly, but pleasing to look at, and creatively done. This movies messages apply to everyone, that you should enjoy the life you have instead of fearing your inevitable death, and appreciating those who you call family. Even as a grown adult, I still got something out of this movie. The character design and creativity is peak, and the movie lacks cringey, immature childish jokes, using genuinely clever humor. Everything about this movie trumps your average Pixar film, making it a very enjoyable watch, even from a picky film fan.","27 December 2022",10,2,4
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","Having been recommended by a friend I entered the cinemas with the highest of expectations in mind. Having said that, this movie went above and beyond the highest of my expectations, with its delicious animation and simply perfect plot-line and character development.

It is clear that DreamWorks took the animation of this movie to a new level, embracing elements of 'The Spiderverse' along with the more traditional animations we'd seen previously. The animation was refreshing and engaging.

More importantly, the characters in this were well thought out, with personal stories and struggles that all of us can relate to, resulting in an often highly emotional watching experience. Furthermore, this movie has a consistent theme and message interwoven in its plot, one that is inspirational and often lacking in most contemporary films today.

All in all, this is a film that I will continue to watch on an annual basis, as it's message is one that we all too often forget in this current climate.","20 January 2023",10,1,1
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","I was skeptical before the movie at first because a lot of quarantine-delayed films haven't done so well. BUT MAN WAS I PROVED WRONG THIS TIME!

A good handful of Dreamworks' movies are very good and this one didn't change the pattern.

Puss In Boots: The Last Wish surpasses the first Puss in Boots as it establishes great plot, amazing climax, and OUTSTANDING SATISFACTION of the characters' wishes.

Go see this movie with family and/or friends as it's a treat for all ages and actually causes tears- well for me...

Overall, from beginning to end, I enjoyed this movie very much and want to see it again very soon.","28 December 2022",10,2,4
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","This movie was absolutely amazing, it was like that old childhood friend of yours that you liked reconnects with you and they were just like you remembered them to be. I always criticize current children's animation to be too childish for my taste compared to what came before them. Well, this wasn't like that there were bits and pieces at the beginning that were a bit cheesy yet later on, the movie becomes that 2000s to 2015 style of non-dumbed down somewhat darker piece that doesn't treat their audience like they were a bunch of 4-year-olds. In summary watch this movie, watch it with your kid, watch it with a friend, and recommend it to random people in the streets.. so studios keep making movies like this.","13 January 2023",9,1,2
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","This movie is terrifying. You know those movies that we look back at and say, ""that one really messed us up."" This is that movie for a new generation of kids. I should of have NEVER off have seen it with my 5 year old. It's 9:30 and he's already gotten up once wanting to get in our bed. It really went out of it's way to be extra creepy. Nothing like Shrek. And it's terrifying the whole way through. It's not just like one scene. Great film, but don't go see it with your kids.

My review needs more characters...So charachters and other characters that have to go to the same places to make the most...great thanks autofill.","28 December 2022",7,1,13
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","Lately I was watching a bunch of movies. ""puss in boots the last wish"" is undoubtedly the best movie I have watched during the Christmas season. It is light hearted, it is funny and every one can enjoy this movie. I was engaged with each of the characters from beginning to end. There was a different perspective to some of the characters. Goldilocks comes as bit selfish and narcissistic but all she was craving is for a human family. The sweet Little jack from one of my favourite childhood nursery rhymes is definitely not the bully.

The animation and special effects in this movie is mesmerizing. So is the dialogue.

All in all there is a very good message, you have one life and enjoy.","2 January 2023",10,2,4
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","I didn't expect a lot watching this film and perhaps that's why I enjoyed it so much. Puss in boots is laid back and witty, I found myself laughing and smiling through the whole film. It's a kids movie, but there's enough witty humor to entertain an adult. I highly recommend this movie for anyone who wants something funny to watch with a good moral to its story. At the heart of this film is the importance of friendship and love for those closest in your life. A simple, but powerful message.

Now the artwork in this film is incredible 😍. Ever shot looks like a painting, truly beautiful. Well done!","7 January 2023",10,1,3
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","This movie checks all the boxes for a good animation film, it has a creative and artistic animation style to it along with a deep story to go along with, upholding the good rep of the Shrek franchise.

The movie also introduces many new characters without making it feel overdone and also manages to develop these characters to a sufficient degree.

The villian does an amazing job of commanding your attention everytime he shows up.

The biggest problem in my opinion was the climax/ last stand against the villain, can't talk about it too much without giving it away but I was expecting a much more extraordinary duel.

Worth and watch whether you're a child or adult.","15 January 2023",8,1,2
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","Shrek and earlier Puss and boots were clever and delivered a great message- we all have our strengths and weaknesses, but kindness is available to all, so be kind and spread it around.

This is just a rehash of flying/ flipping/flopping with little or no plot. Animation is great- but old school plot is what knits a treasure together. This is no treasure.

No one is dazzled anymore by computer generated stunts. There is no substitution for great writing. Great writing it ain't ( poor grammar intended). I've read comparisons to Bullwinkle which is like claiming McDonald's is fine dining. Can you eat it? Yes. Is it good- not really.","24 December 2022",1,24,205
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","Loved it.

Puss in boots 2 doesn't have the most compelling plot, it's very predictable even, but that certainly doesn't take away from the experience. It's a beautiful story, filled with many funny moments and with amazing animation. The scary bits are amazingly well executed, gave me goosebumps! Very friendly to fill in your own references to other works and let your imagination fly. I applaud the artistic decisions of the studio and absolutely loved the classic animation ""12 fps"" scenes. Don't know what the future of animation will bring, but for me once again DreamWorks has delivered something really unique and new to the scene, and I hope they will continue to develop on that path.

Bravo!","6 January 2023",9,2,4
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","I remember watching the 2011 Puss in Boots at least once a day when I was a little kid, so naturally I was super excited to see the movie. I was kind of worried because the style was different and it seemed very different from the first. But it was honestly better than the first one. The characters are all so much fun and fleshed out perfectly, the art style is gorgeous, and the story is so engaging and creative. I even teared up in some parts. All the characters are so cool, especially Death. I appreciate how they still made the first movie canon to the second story. I was bracing for the dog to be insufferable, but i ended up adoring him. It's just mature enough to appeal to both young and older crowds without being insultingly simple. Worth a watch in theaters and all your love! Very excited for what comes next with Dreamworks!","8 January 2023",10,0,1
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","Humor for both kids and adults, and a heartwarming message. I was so impressed that Disney could make this without it being a soulless money-grab...and then I realized it was Dreamworks, not Disney. Good on them for not being like Disney! My four kids and I were highly entertained, even the 3 year old which is a rare find.

Nothing else should really be noted other than that it actually had some slightly scary parts. Nothing was too scary for my littlest and ""dark"" is a better description than scary. I realllllllly hope Dreamworks comes out with more content like this, and it doesn't have to be Shrek. Please keep promoting the stories with good scripts!","30 December 2022",9,1,3
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","Such an amazing movie, great for any and everyone. Dreamworks has given us the best animated film I have seen recently and perhaps the best movie I watched in 2022. This unexpected gem has an amazing plot, phenomenal writing and stunning animation. This sequel is a great blend of humor, edge & darkness, appropriate for kids and entertaining for adults. I found myself laughing heartedly and just enamored with all the childhood classics littering every scene. The underlying theme of valuing life and friendship is extremely relevant and relatable for all audience. This is a surprising must see for the entire family.","21 January 2023",10,0,1
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","Pros
Amazing animation, fun to see into the spiderverse inspiring movies like this oneFelt a lot closer to an action adventure compared to Disney / Pixar movies. While those movies have to have most set pieces advance the main characters' arcs or villains that are foils to the main characters, this movie seemed to have villains that have their own arcs and act primarily as obstacles to the heroes. Felt more like a rollercoaster then a movie meant to deliver one primary lesson or theme, though Puss in Boots still has his own satisfying arc with lessons learned throughoutThe Wolf was actually an intimidating villain with a satisfying arc through the end""Jiminy Stewart"" Cricket, every line was brilliant

Cons
Comedy is hit or miss. Good for a kids movieGoldilocks and the three bears have an interesting ending with one gut punch in particular but are otherwise kinda forgettable.","8 January 2023",8,0,1
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","I haven't seen an animated movie this impactful and truly moving in such a long time. However, from the moment I saw the trailers, and only got a snippet of the amazing action sequences, I just knew it would be something special.

(Very Minor spoilers)

First, I'll start off with the story and characters. Puss in boots has some of the best character development I've ever seen, and it was truly impactful. Kitty Softpaws' internal conflict is also integrated very well and leaves a nice message that isn't too in your face, but it was still crystal clear. Perrito was an amazing addition that not only made me laugh, but cry, frown in sadness, and feel warm inside. Perrito also taught me that it's great to stop and smell the flowers throughout life ;). The bear crime family was an amazing addition to the cast, and the message that they gave was so heartwarming, and they made me cry a few times too for sure. Jack Horner was a hilarious villain that brought some nice good vs evil conflict and levity to the film. Finally, Death gave me the chills every time I heard his whistle theme play throughout the sound system, and he was a truly harrowing villain that I couldn't get enough of. Truly terrifying. The story was executed fantastically as well. Nothing felt too rushed and everyone in the movie got enough screen time. The humor was hilarious, the touching scenes were tear inducing, and the action was butt-clenching. 10/10

Now, the animation was something else. The way the frame rate of the movie shifted gave the action such a dramatic effect. Sometimes, I thought I could almost see a smear from for a millisecond and I found that to be such a cool effect. The camerawork was INSANE. As the characters flipped and fought, the camera would move a ton of different angles, making this not just a movie, but a whole experience. The stylization was beautiful too, I really like how more 3D movies are going a more ""2D"" stylization. The backgrounds looked so vibrant, and the characters really popped out as well, I have to say this is the best animation I have seen in a while.

In conclusion, Puss in Boots really knocked my boots off this movie. I have no regrets spending my time and money on it, I wish I could give it more. This movie was made with so much love and care, and it shows.","29 December 2022",10,2,5
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","We are a cat family so we do enjoy comedies featuring cars. My wife and I were hoping that it'd be as good as the first one. Unfortunately the structure of the story line, maybe too many characters to fit, meant we couldn't get into it. Very few funny scenes and most of them were lofted from the previous movie.

The animation is mostly nice but at times it felt cheap. It felt a half way of some of the 3D TV cartoons and Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse.

Hollywood has lately been giving us too much style/packaging over substance in the past few years. Pixar is an example of that and it's a shame to see this franchise going the same way.","8 January 2023",3,5,28
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","It is, without a doubt, the most visually impressive movie I saw this year, and I watched Avatar 2 like a week ago. Mind blowingly good looking, Puss in Boots also hits right in the feels when it needs to : I cried multiple times during my viewing, and I was the first one surprised. It's all about family and valuing the ones around you, and good lord, these characters are so touching sometimes.

I had a big smile on my face for most of it because what I was watching was AWESOME. Simple warning : if you go watch this movie with little kids around 4, 5 years old, they might get really impressed, even scared, by some scenes. My 4 years old niece was not that scared, and you can definitely go watch it with childrens, but know that this movie takes itself REALLY seriously sometimes (which is a good thing)","8 January 2023",9,1,2
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","The animation in this movie is top tier, absolutely AMAZING. The movement in the fight scenes, the painting art-style. Just absolutely jaw dropping. And the story, the character growth, it's just absolutely incredible. The journey that these kitties and dog go on is so heart warming and fun, it's wonderful.

I recommend this film to anyone who is a fan of animated movies, or a fan of the Shrek franchise. And even if you aren't a huge fan of Shrek, I still recommend this masterpiece of a film.

Hats off to all the animators who worked on this film, they all did a wonderful job. 10/10 film, a must see!","31 December 2022",10,0,2
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","I had no desire to watch this movie. I wasn't a fan of the first Puss in Boots and the last Shrek movie wasn't fun....but a dad's gotta do what a dad's gotta do and I took my kids. I was pleasantly surprised by this entertaining little number. The animation style of the action scenes harkens to some of the newer anime and video game cut scenes with a little Spider-Man: Across the Multiverse thrown in. Many of the jokes are meh or fall totally flat but there's enough there to make a 40-ish guy giggle a few times. The voice talent does an excellent job, which is something we've come to expect from the Land of Far Far Away.","3 January 2023",7,1,5
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","Another fun filled adventure with heart, humor and action. This movie wipes the floor with many of Disney's offerings of late. The quality was excellent. It was a great movie for young and old alike. Great and memorable characters that defy their tropes. Some good lessons presented in a way that was natural and followed the fairy tale origins. The music was catchy, and the jokes actually funny. I wasn't sure if the dog was going to be annoying, but he turned out to be the glue for the characters. Definitely a movie to share with the family and provides a fun and exciting experience for all - and I'm usually a dog person.","3 January 2023",10,0,2
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","The story is meh. It drags in the beginning. The person next to me started to snore. No one in the audience was bothered by the snoring. It was received as more entertaining than the movie. The animation made it difficult and unpleasant to watch. The fight scenes were choppy . I actually turned away several times because visually the movie was stressful. The movie leaves the impression that the studio needed money and rushed production just to have a product. Or worse the studio supports lazy production now. I didn't see much advertising for Puss in Boots so I feel they knew it is a bad product. The hype of new animation and what I now expect as cooked reviews on another sight appears as spin to catch the dollars. I really want an apology.","14 January 2023",1,8,68
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","I went into this movie having absolutely zero expectations, other than that the animation looked pretty good. Impulsively decided to go see it with a couple of my friends, and boy was it good!

I could rave about everything. The animation, the music, the characters, the story- all spectacular. I appreciated how, despite being a kids movie (and I am very much not a kid), it did not treat the audience like they are dumb. Because we're not, and neither are kids! It was very refreshing.

The spiderverse style inspired animation was VERY much appreciated. I hope dreamworks continues with it in the future, as I'm now invested. I thought the Shrek franchise was dead to be honest (Not that the previous Shrek stuff was bad, just thought they'd had their time and it was over), but if they keep up the work like this I will gladly continue watching.","5 January 2023",10,2,5
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","I watched this movie in the cinema around its release and the experience was amazing. This is definitely a movie that benefits from a bigger audience as some moments can be quite cringeworthy due to trying to get a particular emotion out of the crowd so actually experiencing it makes it so much better.

The art direction in this movie was fantastic and borrows elements from Arcane and Spiderverse. Characters have a nice dynamic together and the mature jokes as well as dark experiences definitely turn this movie into something everyone can watch, no matter their age group. It was a captivating movie with a well thought out plot, a story that caters to all emotions and amazing character designs. I love it!","9 January 2023",10,0,1
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","Honestly when I got into the cinema, I thought it would be a good kids movie that is also kinda enjoyable for teenagers/adults, but I didn't expect it to be a MASTERPIECE. Especially the wolf was one of my if not my favorite Villain of cinema Villains of since 2000. It also has Goldi and the bears and this pie Kid guy, although they are sometimes funny, they are definitely not as good as death. I also LOVE the animation. It's the same as the animation in spiderman: into the spiderverse wich I also loved for its animation and especially the fight scenes with the wolf gave me goosebumps. The humor is also sometimes pretty funny although sometimes it's just basic kids humor, but I think that's a good thing, because it makes it enjoyable for even more peoples. But at some parts it's sooo dark that I would definitely rate it for 12+ years and not for 6+ years. It isn't that long, but at least there isn't ANY part of the movie where I would call it boring it's pure enjoyment and I would really suggest everyone to give it a try.","6 January 2023",10,0,2
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","The first movie is one of my favorites. It's funny, the story keeps you on your toes, the visuals are amazing. This one... didn't live up to the amazing adventures of puss in boots, nor his humor. Watching the animations I thought to myself that something must be wrong because it looked like something from 2005, not 2022. Or at least a different style that the original and what I'm used to seeing from DreamWorks. Puss in boots, kitty and some other characters were really well animated whereas, comapared to perrito and the environment which felt like a really early scketch. It didn't feel finished and it wasn't worth the wait.","12 January 2023",5,3,16
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","As I entered the movie theater, walking side by side with my beloved husband Jerry, I didn't know that this absolute cinematic masterpiece of a film would completely and utterly restore my marriage, rekindle my sex life, file my taxes, solve the hunger crisis in Syria, and bring me out of my depression. Jerry and I took our seats, and as we reclined to view the king-tier saga of a film that is Puss and Boots, we rejoiced, cried, and laughed at such a work of art. As the pure joy that this movie radiated continued, I found it to be the single funniest thing I have ever seen in the entire year and dare I say my entire life as well. Jerry and I couldn't hold ourselves from letting the entire movie theater know that such a movie had brought back years of laughter and most of all love that I had previously been without in my drought of a marriage. As soon as we walked out of that theater, Jerry Bear started to release a masculine, dominating, and sigma male growl from deep inside his lungs
His rizz was just right. He was looking for some good porridge. My puss in boots was all out to lose another life. This bed is too hard. This angle is too soft. When we got into the right bed, we had to find a position that was just right. At first he was too soft, then he was too hard, then mmphh, he was just right
Before this, Jerry was the most boring, dry, and limp-dicked shell of a man I had ever encountered, but after this, he turned into an absolute joy and my marriage was completely and utterly restored, and thanks to Puss and Boots, every aspect of my life was completely resolved. Thanks Puss in Boots. LOL! 💅😈","31 December 2022",10,2,7
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","The plot was good, the acting was good, the pacing was good, but the animation looks incredibly cheap. It is definitely a down grade in animation style, it was honestly distracting, especially during the fight scenes. The animation from the first Shrek looked better, and that movie came out over 20 years ago. If the animation was a conscience choice it was a bad one. Other than the visuals the story was pretty good. Puss is being followed by a mysterious wolf who's out to kill him, and he must find a magic map to get to the star that will grant him one wish, and he makes some new friends along the way. Story 8.5/10, Animation 2/10.","28 December 2022",8,0,9
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","When I saw the internet trailers, I didn't expect much of this movie. Honestly, I thought it would just be a cash grab like a lot of animated movies have been recently. A lot of people have told me it's great, so I decided to watch it.

I honestly didn't expect it to be so awesome to watch. Not even because of the beautiful visuals, but because the story was intriguing. The topic of mortality faced by a seemingly fearless is an amazing story concept- and Dreamworks excelled at using it.

The sound design is wonderful- Death's whistle sent shivers down my spine each time I heard it. The emotion put into every scene of this movie is astounding. I expected it to be a dull movie, and it certainly surpassed my expectations.","14 January 2023",10,1,2
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","Puss in Boots 2 clearly has a more polished, polished look, in short, aesthetically better than the first title, especially taking into account the blending of 3D and 2D elements... of fights, it's eye-popping. However, the script leaves a little to be desired, with some very truncated narratives, which does not mean that it is bad, just to say that the story was very mediocre in some aspects, but these aspects almost become imperceptible at such a large scale. Aesthetic beauty that the film provides. In short, it is a film with a charming aesthetic, which easily captures the viewer's attention even in the first minutes of the film, and holds it throughout the rest of it, in addition to guaranteeing some laughs, the comic tone is characteristic of DreamWorks films, however nothing exaggerated, here they hit the tone between the comic and the dramatic. It's a good movie, fun, interesting, thought-provoking, and aesthetically beautiful.","15 January 2023",8,1,2
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","As always, DreamWorks presented fans with a very professional work with friendly scenes, romance, action, and most importantly, an important life lesson. Unlike most of today's animations, which are made with wrong and base goals. Also, the initial scene of the animation where the boy on the moon meets other popular animation characters was really beautiful. In general, this work is another masterpiece of this company, which, according to them, was a prelude to making the fifth part of Shrek, and this is great! Because I am 90% sure that this will be another outstanding work of this company.

The best animation in 2023...","14 January 2023",10,1,3
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","This was something I was not expecting, the storyline is great, likable new characters, funny dialouge and the animation it's just outstanding and euphoric to look at. Not to mention they have one of the creepiest antagonist that I've seen from an animated film in a long time. They do an excellent job in immersing you in and making you feel something for each of the characters. DreamWorks did not pull any punches when making this movie this is by far one of the best movies I've seen come out in a while, and I'm starved of good entertainment if all of there future movies are going to be anything like this one was please give me more. A lot of people need to start taking notes this is how you enterain people disney.","18 January 2023",10,1,2
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","The movie is good from start to finish. Wonderful performances from the whole cast, especially Salma Hayek and Antonio Banderas.

The plot is simple to follow but not in a bad way. The story is set out from the start and there's a nice meaning. The sometimes more serious tone will be great for older movie goers.

The animation style is an squared taste, but much easier to handle than ""Into the Spider verse"". If you like that, then you'll like this one.

The comedy was good, but the movie was at it's best when the action was flowing; with a fantastic final battle.

One of the highlights of the movie was the true main villain (there are multiple). His final fight was a great watch.

All in all, highly recommend.","3 January 2023",9,1,4
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","The animation in this movie is actually well done and reminds me into the spider verse but it actually looked like water coloring in the movie like a fairy tale. Some of the scenes here was actually frightening to see because of this new and probably darkest dreamworks villain yet.. ""Death"". I really like what they done here with death. He is actually scary that my little brother started to tear up! And some of the scenes here can depict a anxiety attack which could be upsetting to some people. But the last scene in the movie actually made me cry because on how sad it was and pretty at the same time. 10/10 and i recommend!!","21 January 2023",10,0,1

"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","I kid you not when I say one of the best things in my life right now is an animated cat movie. ""Puss in Boots The Last Wish"" is a modern masterpiece of animation and I wholeheartedly stand by that statement. My God, THIS is how you do a sequel. Hell, this is even how you do a stand-alone film. I would argue that one doesn't even need to have seen the first ""Puss in Boots"" film to see this one. The only thing that really crosses over is Kitty, but even then she stands on her own pretty well.

I just can't get over this movie. Dreamworks brought their A game and man does it show. Such a simple story in concept but it's good so masterfully that it feels fresh and new. It's also incredibly character driven, with our main players all being likable and charming in their own ways. Even our villain is a nice change of pace, almost poking fun at the trope of giving villains redeeming qualities. Nope, he's just genuinely a bad guy with no redeeming traits. Yet he's still likable and charismatic in his own unique way. The character dynamics in this film are just gorgeous. The familial relationship between the bears and Goldi, the slow but sure bonds that build and strengthen between Puss, Kitty, and Perrito, even the dynamic between Puss and the Wolf when they encounter each other are all so endearing and believable.

Don't even get me started on the animation. My God, I'm in love with how this film looks. I'm so happy Dreamworks has been experimenting with their animation lately because it looks fantastic. The ""Spider-verse"" style lends itself so nicely to this film and the story it is trying to tell. I could prattle on forever about this film, so I might as well stop while I'm ahead.

I cannot recommend this movie enough. I know GDT's ""Pinocchio"" will probably (and rightfully so) take the Oscar, but this is a close second and my pick for sure. I can't praise this film enough. 10/10 recommend to all. A beautiful, mature, and charming story and film that can appeal to anyone young or old.","19 January 2023",10,0,0
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","There are a lot of great parts and my children absolutely loved the animation and character development through the whole series! How they introduced the bad guy was spooky, and entertaining! This is one of the best ones since How to train your dragon and Shriek and my children wanted to purchase it right when it came to video. We saw it in theaters and couldn't stop talking about the characters and detail in the art, it was truly something else. It fun and suspenseful during the fight scenes and death coming around whistling made puss in boots hair rise as well as mine. This is one all families will enjoy!","6 January 2023",10,0,1
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","I was not the biggest fan of the original. But this movie was one of my favorites I've seen all year, and one of my favorite animated movies of all time! Everything about this movie is beyond excellent: the writing, the animation, the emotion, the humor, the voices, THE FIGHT SCENES, everything! The Big Bad Wolf is without a doubt the best movie villain of 2022 and one of the best animated movie villains of all time! I laughed, I cried, and I jumped for joy! It's a movie that makes you want to experience it again and again! I've already seen it twice in theaters, and I cannot wait to see it again!","9 January 2023",10,1,2
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","I found the film exceptionally enjoyable. The animation shifts between action and dialogue, being given a more comicesque outline throughout fights, reducing the frame rate making them easier and satisfying to follow, while reverting to the normal 3d style, I must say the colors are really vivid, the character designs are stunning, and the story is fun and deep.

Each conflict I believe is given time to breathe, while we are also provided a breath of fresh air. For once, I understand the difference between an evil villain and a villain. You have characters to root against, and characters to outright fear. It's an outright genuine experience for Children and Adults who grew up or around this cinematic universe. It would be doing one's self a disservice to not watch this while it is in theaters!","7 January 2023",10,1,3
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","The book illustration like visual are so stunning, the animation are top notch, the voice actor deliver their role very powerful, the direction are so strong, the music was fantastic, the message make me cry! Solid movie to end 2022! It's so amazing that an animation for kids doesn't hide the darkness of compelling storytelling while being funny! A lot of animation movie nowadays trying hard to be funny but doesn't give moral towards kid. But this movie, it's teach us to value life, value of trustworthy, friendship, froster family, appreciation of the one you love, etc. The characters are so good that you can feel each of their personality and get attached towards em. I'm shocked a 2 hours animated movie can make me cried while 3 hours movie just felt empty lol.","7 January 2023",10,1,3
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","This might be one of the best-animated films to come out in the past 5 years. The animation looks amazing. The characters are all likable and endearing, the voice cast did an amazing job of bringing the characters to life. The story is one of the best I've seen from Dreamworks in my opinion. The movie isn't afraid to take dark topics such as mortality. The antagonists are some of the best villains in any Dreamworks Film, And the film is emotional when It wants to be. Go Watch This Film, It's worth your time and money. I hope we get more films like this from Dreamworks, And I hope you enjoy this movie as much as I did.","7 January 2023",9,1,3
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","Guys...this is nothing compared to ""old"" Shrek movies or even to previous Puss in Boots. If I could I would give ""0"" but I can't. There is vulgar language, absolutely horrific scenes, brutality, fast changing agressive colors, abusive behaviours etc. Some scenes are like recreated from adult horror movies. No idea how this was released and got these good reviews. Perhaps bots write them? Definitely not for children of any age to be honest. I can not unsee what I saw. We were so shocked we almost left the cinema. Please do not take your kids to that movie. It is a waste of time and money. I hope this is the last movie in these series...","2 January 2023",1,9,113
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","Minor Spoilers. The movie as a whole is a surprising masterpiece, but it is worth seeing just for the introductory scene of the Big Bad Wolf (Death). It is a sequence so haunting that it had me questioning if i was even watching a kids movie. The bone chilling whistle that precludes his appearance combined with stunning animation and a great vocal performance left my heart racing and a genuine feeling of fear coursing through my blood, which is more than i can say for most horror films. Puss in boots goes from an indomitable living legend, to a petrified and cornered animal in a matter of seconds at the hands of death. His fur stands on end as he stares at his bloodied paw, and his life flashes before his eyes. The fear and panic in the face of this unstoppable force of nature is only natural. Easily one of the top villains in the past few years of cinema, animated or not. It would be a shame to this amazing movie flop in our modern sea of soulless cashgrabs and mediocrity for the sake of marketing, so get down to your local theater and support this genuine work of art.","4 January 2023",10,0,3
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","I saw a few reviews before I went to watch it and they said that it is a good movie but I wasn't expecting this movie to be sooooo good. In my opinion was DreamWorks in the past few years not like back then. The movies were ok or just unnecessary but this one makes the old feelings come back, it was so much fun and as good as the best Shrek movie in my opinion. I would recommend this movie to everyone it is funny, not to long, catchy, and it has great action. I mean it's amazing. The characters are good and the the style of the movie is just incredible it is kinda like the animated spiderman movie. But there is not much more to say, just go in you won't regret it.","8 January 2023",10,0,1
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","From a mother's point of view not child friendly enough for a PG rating. With inuendos of death coming for you and statements like ""death comes for us all"" my little ones found the death wolf a bit scary, and John Horner the antagonist of the story was on the eery side. My little ones also had to hold their fingers and cringe in pain when the ""Spanish splinter"" occurred, they felt that. Children's movies should avoid blood, cringe, and spook, in my opinion. Great for older audiences, not so much younger children. The moral however at the end of the movie was great, but it was almost like talking a walk down a violent path to reach a dim candle.","22 January 2023",3,0,3
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","This movie somehow changed my view of death. And now thanks to Joel Crawford wonderful storytelling and animation style and I came too see this movie as more of lesson in life than just as an entertainment. It shows that even the most badass and fearless of hero like Puss. Have fear and insecurities despite his fame and bravado. And how it comes to appreciating the love ones you left out in your life. For that i am happy and grateful what this movie showed me. And especially how the creator are slowly changing this character's story and personality for the better. I am sure we can expect great things for this character stories in the future.","28 December 2022",10,0,3
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","I love the new Graphics and Colors there better than the old one this is the best movie for this year I love this movie so much it brings my childhood back and I really love puss in boots sooo much. And the new characters are really amazing too and I love the story a lot and it really made me enjoy the time watching them he movie on Dec 23, 2022 my family enjoyed it too. I hope DreamWorks makes another puss in boots later on in the years and I really love the Puss in Boots Cast & Crew the after so great and just one compliment Kitty Soft Paws Looked really Cute and Puss in boots together W Movie.","1 January 2023",10,0,3
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","I went into the movie theater with zero expectations and got a wonderful experience and my hopes up for the future of DreamWorks animation and further Shrek sequels!

The story flows naturally, even if the numbee of side characters make it seem like there's too many storylines to follow. But that doesn't happen! Everything is neatly done and all the story arcs have great endings by the end of the movie. They managed to give every character a change to shine, without giving up any of the fun gags and shenanigans.

The choice of dropping the framerate during action scenes is a master's trick in my opinion, the flow of the characters makes these shots very unique and differentiate them from the rest of the movie.

The themes were well thought out and come together at the end of the movie, the payoff is worth the incredible journey.

Will definitely rewatch this before it leaves theaters.","3 January 2023",10,0,3
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","Honestly one of the best movies or kids movies I've ever seen, definitely top tier DreamWorks movie next to how to train your dragon, incredibly more colorful and vibrant and especially to a cat and Hispanic person it feels a lot more personal and makes everything more lovable and enjoyable, even still you don't need to be a cat or Hispanic to enjoy this movie, it still has its laughs and the art style is as great yet different as spider man's art style that made it so nice, from the great art, enjoyable characters, an interesting narrative with enjoyable characters and especially villains, all with a lovable cat main character, the movie is perfect in nearly all regards and already finished my second play though, it's a movie all ages and backgrounds will love. If you haven't already please go watch it you won't be disappointed, hell I'm only a teen who plays games all day and hates just going out, but I'm so glad I did that night, and with all the mid tier/terrible movies coming out, gives all the more reason to give this one a try.","8 January 2023",10,0,1
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","""Puss in Boots: The Last Wish"" was filled with the same lovable characters reprising their roles from the previous films. Antonio Banderes and Salma Hayek Pinault's character's enduring relationship does not disappoint. The additional new characters are just as funny, charming, and comical. The storyline was easy to follow for all ages. A definite must-watch, at least a couple of times to catch the one-liners in both English and Spanish. The incredible background character antics and animation really keep the movie moving in a positive way. Overall, a comical, adventurous and heartwarming story of lovable characters.","9 January 2023",9,0,1
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","Before reading this review I want you to know that this film is quite dark for dreamworks film. This is not a film for small children. This was just my cup of tea. This may sound insane but the sequel to a bad spin off of Shrek is a masterpiece in so many ways. The biggest surprise I've had in years. Firstly, this movie balances three villains perfectly, (technically six but anyway.) I won't talk about them much but the best character is the wolf by an extremely long shot. All, and yes I do mean all, of the characters are so entertaining.

I can easily say this should win best picture or at least be nominated for best animated picture. Another thing to mention is that the trailer in my opinion should not be watched to get an idea of the film except the animation. Oh the animation. It is probably the best looking thing in the Dreamworks catalogue. They also use it in some of the greatest ways especially with the wolf villain.

Not to mention the fight sequences. Those both use animation to its fullest potential and are incredibly well choreographed. Please watch it. Dreamworks both needs it and deserves it for this amazing amazing film .","19 January 2023",10,0,0
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","I saw this movie in the theater and was amazed by the animation. It was crazy good. I have always been in love with dream work studios and puss in boots. Character design is amazing, totally recommend seeing this with your kids!! What ever karens are saying about Deaths character design is too scary, don't listen to them. I saw this with my 6 year old sister and she wasn't scared. His design isn't even that scary. To all of the Karens out there, if you don't want your kids to see an amazing movie, you probs make your 10 year old watch Cocomelon. Again, totally recommend this movie if your bored! It's one of DreamWorks best movie!","19 January 2023",10,0,0
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","This movie perfectly captures the world of Shrek and the atmosphere of the first movie, only with a better story.

As in the first movie the stakes weren't that emotional, this movie improves on the storytelling. The characters are well written and funny. This movie does not sacrifice it's story for some comedic jokes, but rather incorporates very funny jokes with a witty story with some emotional real stakes for the main characters.

The bad guys are well designed and either extremely funny or actually terrifying (or both).

In conclusion I think this movie really captures the magic of the world of Shrek with a style that perfectly captures puss in boots.","20 January 2023",10,0,1
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","The movie is interesting, the children enjoyed it very much. But the Bulgarian dubbing was terrible! Goldilocks and the bears talked disgustingly. The children did not understand what they were saying. We have to explain them what they are saying. The stunt doubles had chosen to speak a dialect from a region that was incomprehensible. I don't even know how they would translate this in English.

It was awful experience for us. We have to relax and enjoy, but we were afraid how to explain what you have in mind.

I think that in Bulgaria you have a big problem with the dubbed. Most of people won't understand the story.","23 January 2023",1,0,8
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","As a dad of 2 kids (10 and 8) is a becoming complicated to watch movies that I consider ""adequate"" for kids like the ones I used to watch when I was a kid.

Puss in boots: The Last Wish is a movie that I thought it was going to be a big bomb due to the lack of ads, or hype behind, it reminded me to St@ng3 W0rld. But as I watched Puss in Boots 1, I still had my doubts. Any way, I picked up my kids and just went and watch it and WOOOWW I got a great surprise. This is a movie with no agenda in it!!! You can really turn off your brain and just enjoy a good movie, it really delivers, as a kids movie you know the plot has hole and stuff but mainly is amazing.

As an adult, I enjoy highlighting when a kids movie has a good foe. The Big Bad Wolf is just AMAZING! Every scene he appears the movie gets hijacked, his whistle, looks, the way he talks just tells you how menacing he actually is! That's my favorite character (if there was any doubt by now.

This movie is able to deliver a big big big teaching to kids about family and life!

As a dad is totally recommended, if you still can, go to the theater and watch it.","23 January 2023",9,0,0
"Puss in Boots - The Last Wish","I felt like a kid who, during the winter holidays, cathected over and over again, a VHS tape borrowed from kindergarten with the adventures of the green ogre. It was all fresh - yes, the comparisons to ""Spider-Man Universe"", are apt, but this animation, however, has even more combinatoriality and flashiness in it, which come out in the end. Technically - yes a gem.

The inner child had a perfect time, but age and a more mature outlook made it possible to appreciate the message and gags aimed at adult viewers - no wonder - B. Wierzbieta, who made Shrek such a good comedy, is responsible for the Polish dubbing.

Here everything just sticks together, and every minute is well balanced. Yes - this is a movie for years to come, because modern kids watching it in 10 years will get completely different things out of it than they do now. I missed such animation, and definitely the cat redeemed its guilt from the first - mediocre - installment.","19 January 2023",8,0,0
"The Sea Beast","There's nothing like a good story at sea! And this is the kind of movie you hope is as good as it looks. And to me, it delivered.

From the impressive physics, beautiful art direction, and immaculate visual execution.. to a proper story with a good message (and symbolism), charming and colorful characters, and dialogue that is never wasted or unnecessary. In fact, there's a lot of appreciated visual storytelling.. Just one look or one scene, and you can easily put yourself in the shoes of the cast. And while there is little to be said that hasn't been said before, it manages to create a bountiful world and story worth watching!

People might compare it to a certain Dragon film.. but that doesn't diminish the value of this one. Personally, I liked this one best, but I'm glad there's just more ""colors"" to enjoy for everyone. I only wonder if we'll see more of it, though I don't think we should. But one rarely ever knows what we want, until we are surprised with it.

As the movie said, ""I have everything I need right here.""","10 July 2022",8,150,171
"The Sea Beast","Firstly, the visuals. Everything is visually gorgeous and well designed, from Bridgetown (think Victorian Venice) to the ships to the ocean. A lot of care was taken in the actual animation (i.e. Movement) of all of these elements. The waves and spray of the ocean look like they're from a documentary, the swaying of the ship looks truly forceful and the destruction of the town is full of debris and dust. Not to mention a clever little scene involving a rope and a coconut tree. This gives the entire film an immersive feeling and really raises the stakes as we can truly appreciate how powerful the forces of nature are.

Secondly, the dialogue was great. A lot of the film is just bickering between the sailor and the young child, which showed off their personalities and never got annoying. Every character in this film has such a distinctive personality that it's like we know them in real life.

Thirdly, it's not a very original story. Like many others, I thought of How to Train Your Dragon halfway through watching, as the characters and overall storyline are similar. Does this film add much to improve on that inspiration? Beyond the change in setting, not really. One glaring flaw is the the dragons in How to Train Your Dragon have much more personality, while the beasts in this film are quite tepid.

Overall, a good film. I still rated it 7/10. But it could have been higher if it differentiated itself from previous films and had a more compelling ending.","11 July 2022",7,44,51
"The Sea Beast","This is a fantastic movie for all ages. While oversimplified, this kind of story can only be so complex to work as what it is. I thought the animation was especially well done, because capturing the physics of the ocean, ships and objects together is super tricky. The girl's voice didn't really work for me (too young maybe) and some of the dialog could've been better,, but overall this is very entertaining moment to moment. Nice job!","10 July 2022",8,75,92
"The Sea Beast","If it was a Disney movie, everyone would be talking about this movie, but unfortunately, not a lot of people saw this movie. For me, I saw the trailer by chance on YouTube, so I was interested. It is a very fun movie with amazing animation and a great story.","11 July 2022",8,69,80
"The Sea Beast","Set in a world of fantastic Sea Beasts, orphan Maisie Brumble (Zaris-Angel Hator) grows up admiring the heroic exploits of monster hunters in various books with no ship of monster hunters more revered than Captain Augustus Crow (Jared Harris) of the ship The Inevitable who is respected by his crew especially Jacob Holland whom Crow rescued as a boy and views as an adopted son. Following the Inevitable's successful hunt of a sea beast, the King (Jim Carter) and Queen (Doon Mackichan) of the empire they serve are displeased with Crow for having abandoned pursuit of sea beast, The Red Bluster, in order to rescue fellow monster hunters from another sea beast. Declaring the age of hunters over and assigning Admiral Hornagold (Dan Stevens) the task of bringing down Red Bluster with the royal frigate The Imperator, Crow and his crew soon setout in a race to bring down Red Bluster to prove the age of hunters is still alive. Maisie stows away having lost her monster hunter parents on board the ship The Monarch, and Crow allows her to stay despite Jacob's objections but eventually Maisie and Jacob discover the true nature of the sea beasts isn't aligned with what they've been told.

The Sea Beast is the latest animated film from Netflix and fourth directorial effort from Chris Williams following his work on Bolt, Big Hero 6, and co-directing Moana. Williams directs from a story he co-wrote with Nell Benjamin and the film in many ways feels like a spiritual successor to Williams' Moana with the seafaring setting and emphasis on adventure/exploration making them feel like cinematic cousins. While Williams does revisit familiar territory, he does so in a rousing fashion that harkens back to classic swashbucklers and seafaring stories that results in a great animated adventure.

What really stood out to me with The Sea Beast was the dedication to creating what looks and feels like a livable and believable world. Too often these days a lot of fantasy films, especially animated ones, will feel the need to insert more contemporaneous dialogue into the film rather than tailoring the words for the world. Many recent Disney films have had this issue for me such as Raya and the Last Dragon where there were multiple utterances of the phrase ""Dragon Nerd"" that felt way too contemporary for the setting presented. The Sea Beast does a nice job of sidestepping that trope and I was appreciative of how the screenwriters avoided contemporary terminology or slang (with the exception of a very subtle nod to Xenomorphs of all things in a dialogue exchange, didn't see that coming) and the actors felt like they were inhabiting written roles rather than presenting themselves as is.

The characters are all nicely rounded with Karl Urban playing dashing hero Jacob Holland whose appearance harkens back to swashbucklers like Errol Flynn's Captain Blood in movement and design and despite possessing an edge, the movie gives him a lot of humanity and vulnerability with some great scenes between him and Jared Harris' Captain Crow. Jared Harris is also quite good as Captain Crow and there's definitely more than a little bit of Captain Ahab in the character as he carries a deep seated grudge against Red Bluster but like Jacob the character also gets some solid moments of humanity which adds to the sadness and rage that motivates his character. Zaris-Angel Hator does well in her first starring role having previously only done supporting work in series such as Black Earth Rising and she does a solid job of bringing enthusiasm and joy to this character which is also counterbalanced by uncertainty that leads her to question everything she's learned about the sea beasts, it's a really solid performance from Hator and I look forward to seeing more of her in the future.

The story is made from familiar parts but it does a good job of refining and remixing the elements to put its own stamp on it. The plot involving a multigeneration feud between the world of man and the world of mystical beasts will undeniably invite comparisons to something like How to Train your Dragon, but the movie does a solid job of making this story about the cost of hatred based on lies and in the age of disinformation that's a valuable lesson to not just children but adults about questioning the source of those want you to be afraid of something. The way Jacob and Maisie go through this world coming across the various wonders leads itself to many breathtaking moments that left me with a sense of genuine awe.

The animation is great with solid character and creature designs as well as exquisitely detailed rendering in the environment. Despite Chris Williams' Moana already making the water and sand effects look pretty impressive, Williams somehow manages to even up that as from the first shot where we see young Jacob adrift on a violent sea with burning ship wreckage in the background, the visuals are not only technically impressive but really pop with key moments that emphasize the scale of the sea beasts or the lush nature of the environments.

If I were to criticize The Sea Beast, I would say it's first act is maybe a bit longer than it needed to be. The movie commits a lot of time to its worldbuilding with where the beasts are, how they're tracked, and the culture of monster hunting, but then there's other parts of the story that feel extraneous such as Dan Stevens' very brief turn as Admiral Hornagold who's positioned early on as being a competitor to Captain Crow for Red Bluster, but after his introduction he disappears for most of the movie and when he does come back he's so inconsequential you think ""why did this character need to be here?"". Dan Stevens is a terrific actor and always welcome, but he does so little in the role it seems like a bit of a waste to even have him here. There's also some odd underdevelopments in other areas such as a bargain Captain Crow makes with a shady character or the King and Queen who become more important in the third act aren't given names, but these are minor nitpicks in the grand scheme of things.

The Sea Beast is a solid animated adventure from Netflix and continues Chris Williams' impressive resume as a director. While the story hits familiar beats, it has a remarkable dedication to building a world and sticking by that world without feeling the need to undermine itself with self-aware humor or purposeful anachronisms or contemporary dialogue. Some plot points feel a little extraneous or could've used some fine tuning, but it's a solidly entertaining adventure I can highly recommend.","9 July 2022",9,66,97
"The Sea Beast","Stunningly beautiful and colourful. Attention to detail in graphics is amazing. A story about befriending assumed enemies and leaving behind a generations long cycle of vengeance in exchange for peace. Effortless story telling.

"The Sea Beast","The Red Beast, Huge like fish, is how the story got it's new beginning. The Plot is about doing good.

Living a great life and dying a great death, shouldn't be about fighting the so claimed monsters rather, living in peace with them. It's about doing what's right for the greater good and telling the truth. Not selling more lies for our own benefits and to satisfy our greed.

It's a very nice anime about lot's of great meanings.

"The Sea Beast","It has very much a How To Train Your Dragon feeling, but it's very good in its own right. The creature designs are just adorable. The animation itself has some really stunning moments, it's very good.

The lead character honestly is amazing, she really does bring up a lot of really valid issues, but it's still very much in with a children's animation. And a lot of characters are really likeable, so you do get emotionally invested in them.

The ending is perfect too, really heart warming.","9 July 2022",9,26,44
"The Sea Beast","Unlike some people here, that clearly need to upgrade or properly setup their tv, say, this is another step up for graphics. You can take it from someone that has seen and loved animated movies for a long time, this is amazing.

The lighting and reflections, specially through hair. The fabrics on cloth's, reflections in a puddle of water on the deck, different collouring throughout the day, underwater scenes and so on. It really pops off your tv. I would especially recommend an oled for this.

Besides all the graphical splendor, the story is compelling and bold. A mixture of Moana and Raya and the dragon. Liked the story, loved the graphics!","8 July 2022",9,88,126

Kudos to the voice actor they did an amazing job portraying Maisie's character! Red was perfectly cute and scary. The water scenes in the beginning with the sea monsters was actually quite frightening. Maybe it's just because I'm afraid of getting lost at sea or in space and being swallowed whole by a ginormous beast. I was watching the movie and I was like is that Karl Urban?

"The Sea Beast","It started out great, but after a short bit it became quite predictable. A little girl who has never been on the sea and who has dreamt all of her life too become a hunter just knows that the sea beasts are the good guys and knows everything that's going on with them. In my opinion it became quite cliche.

The animations and so were great and the voice acting was amazing.","15 July 2022",4,31,49
"The Sea Beast","A story where the real beast were the humans all along is a classic, unfortunately this is marred by lack of any reason for much of what happens or how the war started. What would the monarchy gain by a war that made trade more dangerious, and why would intelligent beasts attack civilian ships not hunting them. And why did one of the beasts on the island attack our protagonists. The whole thing falls apart with Disney Black and White nonsense.

Besides that, most of the movie is fine, and well animated.","31 July 2022",5,16,29

"The Sea Beast","This movie tries so hard to be diverse and to transport the message of a world where we are all like the colors of the rainbow, it simply forgot to tell a proper story.

I mean, c'mon. The story of this movie fits on a page... a very small one that is. And the little girl is like your stereotype of a child this age. A little spoiled know-it-all, who thinks that everything automatically gets better, just because she's there. But she relies on the white male with his toxic masculinity when it gets tough? Very inconsistent.

So why the five stars, you might think. From an artistic point of view, there is quite a lot to like. The world seems quite consistent, the artwork is detailed and often really beautiful. And most of the time I also liked the overall vibe of the movie, including the excellent score by Mark Mancina. Also, the voice acting is really good.

So the movie is entertaining and to some degree a nice family fun movie. But it feels unpolished, rushed and ill-focused with all the modern topics it wants to transport to the audience.","10 July 2022",5,90,215
"The Sea Beast","I believe the word is forced. The whole movie felt forced. Unrealistic in any sense of the word and forced. The animation, the sound, the acting, and definitely the story... All needed more work.

"The Sea Beast","Pirates of the Caribbean meets How To Train Your Dragon in this simple, sweet & sumptuously animated sea voyage that's crafted with sincerity & rendered with finesse. The Sea Beast is a fascinating story about fantastic beasts & sailors who venture to find them and makes for one surprisingly delightful adventure-fantasy that packs no shortage of heart, heroics & humanity.

Co-written & directed by Chris Williams, the story takes its inspiration from several well-known sources and mashes them together to come up with its amusing premise. What makes it worth viewing & investing into however are the colourful set of characters who are scripted with care, bestowed with proper arcs & exhibit strong personalities. And it's their relationships that drives the plot forward.

The animation is rich in detail & gorgeous to look at and also gets much of the oceanic physics right. Add to that, the picture is breezily paced and its moments of action also carry that sense of awe & wonder that its vibrant score complements beautifully. Still, it fails to stick the landing as its simplistic themes & easily resolved conflicts only hurt its emotional impact and prevent it from realising its true potential.

Overall, The Sea Beast is a thoroughly fun, consistently entertaining & mostly satisfying offering that promises an enjoyable time to its viewers & delivers it effectively. Despite the familiar beats, there is a freshness to it but its last act also needed extra polish as there was more up for grabs than what the story eventually settles for. Nevertheless, the positives outweigh the negatives by a big margin and it scores better marks than anticipated.","29 July 2022",,7,14
"The Sea Beast","Writing from an adult human (which I am) point-of-view, I would want to point out the broad ethnic diversity of the cast... and that is all for the pluses: lower than average animation-style, the physicality of the beasts (parting water on the surface like it's just a tiny toy), the movements in and on the water (DiCaprio would be jealous of Young Jacob on his makeshift raft) just did not feel right from the beginning (...and the story... aaaaaaaaah...).","1 August 2022",3,12,27
"The Sea Beast","Tedious sermonising and woeful characterisation made this a 2 hour slog. I'm a fan of animated movies - many a time I've watched the same one over and over again from the sheer joy of escaping into a make-believe world. Sadly, The Sea Beast is a hopeless hodge-podge of genres - hardly a child-friendly movie (frightening aliens creatures, repulsive characters and dubious dialogue - 'bollocksed' anyone) and yet the main monster looks like a plastic chewy toy your favourite puppy might like - and the little infantile blue monsters seem to have appeared from a totally different movie ('Trolls' maybe). The hero - Jacob - is a naive and rather stupid child in an adult's body while the little girl is sickeningly sassy and self-confident, spouting pearls of wisdom rather than actually having the kind of conversation a child would enjoy listening to. Obviously, the director had a message to convey come hell or high water. It might have been easier if he'd hired a bill-board for the week. Ignore the good reviews - this is a crock of. . .","9 July 2022",1,76,175
"The Sea Beast","A good graphics and colorful world in this movies deserve four points.

But it's just it, nothing to expect. It could have been way better and more special than How to train your dragon because it has all the good set up and so much potentials in this fiction world. But I think the director and writer is just bad and they ruined the whole thing. There's no story in this movie, everything is very predictable and somewhat cringe. It's just like the main character just happen to change their mind so quick because the script said so. I don't feel any progress in the character and I don't think that their actions make any sense. It's a 2-hour movie but everything feel so rush and it don't have the clear and highlight moment that could make the whole plot turn to a sensible way, the real moment that main character really find the truth. All the supporting characters are quite faint and unmemorable, in a lot of times, I don't know why they're even there.

Sometime I think they are trying to make a political standpoint through this movie that makes every plots, dialogs, transformations feel so weird and rush. And it's a kid movies, don't try to cram too much political in the real world to an animation film. Some good and decent story's about what is a good thing and what is a good-hearted person would like is enough. Stop putting woke ideology in every film, Netflix !!! A Korean Film is now more worth to watch and they're doing a very good job to make an excellent film than most of the crap western film.","22 July 2022",4,20,29
"The Sea Beast","The story has few surprises but it is told very well. The animation is superb without being overblown and stealing the screen. The cast does an excellent job where it would be easy to ham up the pirate voices.

Who would have thought a tale about fantastical sea creatures and a group of hunters would teach us one of the most practical lessons of our lifetime. The subtext willfully delineates the importance of peace and harmony and prioritizes the need for Love & Compassion amidst a world full of hatred and animosity. And on top of all, the narrative here inspires us to have a broader perspective on humanity and life itself!

From a very young age, we've been taught to hate, to discriminate; more often than not, we humans are advised to care only for our kind and let the rest suffer the consequences of our dreadful judgments. And this so-called naivety or selfishness, whatever you may name it, has been persistently misused by the people up in higher ranks! Just to please their selfish deeds, to appease their appetites for more authority and leverage. They had done everything they could to divide, to misguide.

Not only the Monarchies in distant history are responsible, but it's quite the same for the modern-day democratic systems as well. Their strategies may have transitioned to suit their newer agendas, yet those people in power continue to take advantage of common residents to satisfy their longings. ""The Sea Beast"" takes a firm stand against that very notion! The film in its own right may not be an embodiment of perfection but the underneath statement holds much greater significance and one that should not at any cost be disregarded.","11 July 2022",7,9,23
"The Sea Beast","The story is exactly similar to, how to train your dragon, in the Sinbad legend of the seven seas. I like that but the whole story was predictable, even beast reminds me of train your dragon, if the story was different it cloud be much better, overall recommend it.","9 July 2022",7,23,35
"The Sea Beast","Almost identical plot to How to train your dragonFewer beasts(only about 4). The main one even has similar design and personality with Toothless.

Ending is cringy, stupidly simple.

In summary, a poor stolen version of How to train your dragon. Well done Netflix, you thief.","9 July 2022",6,57,111
"The Sea Beast","Peak 3D animation style with a good voice cast. It wasn't as great or exciting as the trailer showed it to me. Some good scenes and a lot of weak scenes, all put together in a decent way. The pacing was slow and the massive 119 minutes runtime felt too excessive for this film.","17 July 2022",4,7,17
"The Sea Beast","Otherwise, this movie is just ok. The story is very predictable. And, is kind of odd. It is hard for me to write anything about the movie because it didn't ignite much feeling for me. I did give it a second chance after trying to watch it once. Just an ok movie with excellent animation.","29 July 2022",5,5,9
"The Sea Beast","If you or your children enjoy monsters and sea battles this is the movie for you. Someone referred to it as ""how to train your dragon sea addition"" and I would completely agree.

As an adult I was entertained throughout. Plenty of laughs and valuable lessons demonstrated within the plot points. Immediately after it finished it was requested that we watch it again.

There are a few moments of bloody fight scenes and some words that I would consider inappropriate for my 6 year old, but overall it was a good movie.","8 July 2022",7,30,47
"The Sea Beast","Daily reminder that overrated doesn't mean bad and that I actually quite enjoyed this film but it's far from a top 10 of the year, even though that's not exactly saying much.

The Sea Beast is filled and brimming with high tier animation, thrillingly suspenseful and intense action sequences, and amazing voice acting, especially from Karl Urban and Jared Harris, they are both fantastic in this film, the 2nd act especially had me hooked while the first act kept my interest very well.

But here's the thing, I seriously hated the central protagonist, she was both extremely annoying and incredibly idiotic through almost the entire movie, and it's also at least 20 minutes too long.

But those definitely didn't drag it down too much, The Sea Beast is a great Netflix watch, and I'm gonna give it a B+","7 October 2022",7,1,1
"The Sea Beast","The Sea Beast is an incredible animated adventure that's an absolute joy to watch thanks to its fascinating world building, satisfyingly emotional core, genuinely funny humour and vibrant animation. Even though the central twist is predictable and has been done before, it's used cleverly to explore surprisingly relevant themes.

Karl Urban adapts to voice acting extremely well, delivering a performance full of energy, humour and nuance. Combined with Zaris-Angel Hator, who is an absolute bundle of joy, they make for loveable duo whose antagonistic antics and strong chemistry never gets old.

The animation is excellent, a unique balance of impressive detail and stylised simplicity. Chris Williams' direction is superb with suitably impressive scale and a fast pace. The music by Mark Mancina is fantastic, perfectly matched for the film with a sense of adventure and fun.","19 August 2022",9,3,6
"The Sea Beast","Watched the movie then read the reviews on IMDB. I gotta say that IMDB has to put a stop to all the racist reviews. Most of the 1* reviews are people complaining about the diversity of the movie and how there isn't enough white characters. How is this a good review? These type of reviews drop a movie rating, critics and studios look at this. A racist review should be deleted, I expect better from IMDB.

Onto the movie.

The plot sounds like how to train your Dragon but it isn't. It's so much more. I personally was hooked from the beginning, the soundtrack is fantastic and well the animation deserves an Oscar..

The animation style and the design are some of the best I've seen in the past decade. All the attention to detail, the textures in everything is just insane. The diversity of the characters, the hair, the boat, the clothing, the lighting, everything is just award winning. I couldn't stop looking at how dynamic everything was. I was not surprised by the studio who made it, off course they are the creators of spider verse. I also gotta give props to the directing, this guy was responsible for Moana and Big Hero 6 and those 2 are some of my favorites from Disney. When you have a good director, the movie will be flawless

Overall is a great movie, I've watched it twice already. I always love supporting animation movies, we don't get enough, specially when people are biased with Disney movies that anything that isn't theirs, they trash. Netflix is producing good content, soon they will not even use other studios to create their movies. This is prime animation time and I'm glad Sony Animation is doing what we wished Disney, Pixar and Dreamworks were. 10/10.","12 July 2022",10,11,24
"The Sea Beast","I love this kind of animation theme. Always love it. When i first saw The Sea Beast, my expectation was this movie will have the same energy as moana and show so much beautiful ocean scene. And i was wrong, i was stun each time they amazingly succeed to catch deep ocean moment point of view. That scene have a really great detail in term of feeling.

Also love the whole conversation with unique and fun term of words using. It's another set bar movie for me. Great job.","15 July 2022",8,2,3
"The Sea Beast","I really wish that the story didn't become so overly eye-roll-inducingly-simplistic near its end, and its theme of man v beast has certainly been done in very similar ways in other films (primarily How to Train Your Dragon).

But The Sea Beast puts just enough of a twist on its familiar premise to be worth a watch. In particular, I loved the compelling focus on Jacob's struggle with loyalty in the face of moral conflict.

The animation is strikingly good, especially considering it's a Netflix production. The colors pop and the artificial lighting is gorgeous to behold. It's on par with the work of Pixar and Dreamworks.

The action sequences were also a pleasant treat for the eyes. They fluidly move over the sea beasts' bodies to emphasise the monstrous scale of these creatures, and are very well-directed.

Moral complexity of the muddiness of history is a theme that is very deeply explored early on in the film, but at the climax all nuance is thrown out the window for a superbly obvious message. I wish it had retained its nuances, but I get that they want to have a cleanly wrapped-up ending for the kids.

It's quite good, even if it could have been great.","22 August 2022",7,1,1
"The Sea Beast","Okay. This story has been seen before. A clear example is How to train your dragon. But what is questionable is not precisely that, but the reasons why this argument must be seen again and again. There are traditions around the world that are often ruthless with the animal world. Things that today have no logic or coherent explanation other than the mere fact of belonging to a certain culture. Whaling in Asia, bullfighting in Spain, rodeos in Chile and much more. Traditions cannot be sustained over time only by honoring our ancestors. If we are damaging what surrounds us, it must not continue. The message of this film is very clear.

Speaking of the technical aspects of the film, it is an animation that stands out for its realism and textures within an animated world. The new technologies, which are not so new anymore, allow a beautiful hyper-realism that fills each plane with subtleties. The characters could have had better kinetics and gesticulation, especially in moments where the emotions were more extreme, but considering the audience it was addressed to, it is something that is forgiven.

Entertaining, great message, good voice acting (it was weird hearing The Butcher stop a monster from being killed), and great aesthetics.

Totally recommended.","15 July 2022",7,2,3
"The Sea Beast","Wasn't expecting something so entertaining , watched it with subtitles and the whole family enjoyed it , it's always good to watch surprises like this movie.","9 July 2022",10,15,37
"The Sea Beast","This was just so well made, by everyone, from every department involved in getting this to the silver screen. I am a huge fan of animation, CGI and Japanese Anime, or in short form for all...Cartoons! Some reviews here are totally sad for the reasons given for the reviewers disliking the film. One person gave it a very low score because they thought it was too, WOKE! Arghhh...that stupid description word being used for anything is bad enough (I hate this stupid numb-nut trendy colloquial slang gang word) but for a cartoon of this great quality, well, its just so petty! There are so many Thomas The Tankers around these days, who don't seem able to just chill-ax, because they try to be so hip and wise; but are just being a dip who cries.

I would think that kids of all ages are going to love this film - except the miserable grumpy brigade - and that it will become a animation classic in the future. There is way too much good about this film that it is just impossible to give you a short rundown and, as such people just need to see it; with or without siblings etc.

A couple of reviews have likened this to 'How To Train Your Dragon' which I find very odd as, it is nothing like the Dragon films (so good they were too); the sea creatures also don't fly or breathe fire etc and, they certainly don't look like Dragons!

The technical work in this film is amazing! Take a close look at things like hair, water reflections eyes and movement; as well as a ton of other little things that all add up to make a visual treat.

Finally! I hope that a lot of the kids will pick up on the moral within the story and, if not, maybe their parents will sit them down and explain why they need to preserve everything about the seas of our planet and live harmoniously with the creatures of Earth. Mother Earth is known as Terra Firma but the way humans are destroying it (for greed and profits) its become 'Terror Infirma'!","2 August 2022",10,3,6
"The Sea Beast","Amazing animation. Really well done for the scenery. Unfortunately Red's animation was quite flat. She looked like Toothless with a big horn.

The script is very bland. Same recycled lines you've heard before. It's a very long movie but not a lot happens and it's hard to get through. Characters areny that likeable. Typical dumb man with a super smart little girl...

Really was hoping for something new and fresh but I was left very disappointed...","15 July 2022",4,12,21
"The Sea Beast","Wow, that was beautiful
The kid's monologue was all the impact needed to make the story end perfect, that ending was super heavy. I mean writer really took it serious example from the real world, that was just a part of it and the rest was left to the imagination how that was started, but that's why the ending nailed it. The water animation quality was really damn great. I think the studio might have taken a lot of time perfecting it cause I didn't know why the skin of beasts and humans was like that, it was like rubber-plastic, maybe it was the creative choice of the makers but still, I think the skin texture of creatures could have little better. Chris Williams known for directing movies like Disney's Bolt, Big Hero 6 & Moana made this Netflix's own animation film great. If you like animated movies like Bolt and Big Hero 6, a kind of serious story with a beautiful world then you gonna enjoy this.","20 August 2022",9,3,4
"The Sea Beast","Of course, it's a kids' movie. But that doesn't mean it's not enjoyable. Is it predictable? Of course. Because it's a kids' movie! Is the humor sometimes chilidish? Of course. Because it's a kids' movie! Do the monsters look kinda 'harmless'? Yes, of course. Because...
But all the steps from drama, to conflict, to empathy back to conflict and drama to happy end are well made. The pace is good, it has the right amount of great humor, and the usual cuteness.

And while RED in particular, might look a bit 'cheap', the overall CGI is stunning sometimes. The water, the characters, the environment, and the buildings really shine under the fantastic lighting.

So, even if you're an adult that likes a simple-message-happy-end animation movie from time to time, this one is definitively recommendable.","9 July 2022",8,8,20
"The Sea Beast","While it's nearly the exact same story, I didn't hate it. I actually like this iteration even if it is not original. You can also see the shape of toothless's face, head, eyes, and teeth perfectly in the main monster all of those traits at once its too convenient to be a coincidence. Lol.","13 July 2022",4,9,16
"The Sea Beast","The Sea Beast is a movie that begins sailing in such a charming way that it hooks most of your attention from the beginning. Right off the bat one of the few things which help grip us into this world are the characters at first and then the visuals that surround the characters. The visuals and cinematography play a big role in making this journey really soothing for us. From the first act to the last things goes on quite a steady pacing with a few little bumps but they easily get ignored. Coming to the story it seems like something fresh and new but later on you realize the same smell this story is giving off by having the same pattern as the movies that came before this one. The plot tied with the characters and the enjoyable moments is what steered it until the very end. Director Chris Williams has certainly done a good job making us sit for the whole lot and gripped us to our sits with this harmony. All in all The Sea Beast stands high as something you wanna watch for the first time and maybe for a second time also.","31 July 2022",7,3,6
"The Sea Beast","Plenty of buckles are swashed in this well-made family-friendly adventure movie. Whilst the story doesn't break any new ground, it's tightly written and feels genuine in a way few modern kids films do these days. The animation is often superb and is matched by some of the best voice acting you'll find. Jared Harris and Karl Urban are notably good, but are not the only great performances. Whilst it doesn't quite match the magic of the How To Train Your Dragon franchise, The Sea Beast is richer, deeper and more memorable than the majority of recent Disney films, and is a refreshing change from the seemingly endless stream of comedy-heavy, action-lite films for kids.","6 August 2022",8,3,5
"The Sea Beast","As others have said, it's essentially a bad version of How To Train Your Dragon. Some of the CGI is great, the water and hair for example. But the monster designs don't match with the style and are poorly animated. The dialogue is just awful with fake accents that the well known actors can't seem to manage making it cringy and tedious.","9 July 2022",5,33,64
"The Sea Beast","When you introduce a kid in a movie, Who is more intelligent than everyone else, then that movie automatically by the youtube algorithm becomes so cringe that could not be handled by anyone.

Gave 5 star only for the graphics and the art style.","20 July 2022",5,13,23
"The Sea Beast","Substantial animated movie got familiar beats but Chris Williams refined 'em into bold message about trust issues. Wish it had unequivocal ending for few subplots earlier. Still its gorgeous visual made such astonishing adventure between Red & Maisie/Jacob.","25 July 2022",8,3,7
"The Sea Beast","This movie is a gem. It definitely is not getting the props it deserves. I watched this movie to see if it would be ok for my 5 y/o - I will likely hold off till she is a bit older as there are some scenes that could be frightening for a child under 7 - as there is depiction of monsters, blood, violence, and small curses BUT it is a great movie for the family to watch. The animation is great and story is great (predictable at times but its also a kids movie so that will always be the case). Yes, it being a kids show will have a lecture tone to it and that is ok - all kids movies are meant to teach a lesson. This movie had How To Train Your Dragon vibes and it is definitely worth a watch and a re-watch.","3 August 2022",7,4,7
"The Sea Beast","While being a family movie, The Sea Beast explores important themes. The concept of rightful war, how history is written by the winners and redemption. A good lesson for all publics.

The animation is fluid. I'd like more texture, but it's aesthetically pleasing. The monster designs felt kind of derivative of movies like How to train your dragon. Not the most original premise, but a movie with a lot of heart and a solid vision.","2 August 2022",8,3,5
"The Sea Beast","No pun intended - it really is about monsters or beasts. But you could be fooled if you only go by appearance. Or by other optical distinguishing factors (also origins). Animals often are referred to as beasts. But to be honest, they do tend to act out of nature - out of what their instincts are telling them to do.

I reckon you could watch certain movies with different eyes if you had more of a heart for the ""beast(s)"". That all being said, the movie begins with us on the journey - rather on the hunt for the main beast. But we get distracted somewhat. Still we learn about a few characters and their motivation.

You maybe could make the argument that no one is really evil. Everyone has their motive(s). In comes a little one - someone who might be able to change the perspective someone has on things.

This may be aimed at the little ones, but there are enough themes and stuff that grown ups will discover for their own entertainment. Really well done - no pun intended and not just meant to describe the effects/animation style. There is a story with social messagine here. You may find certain things to be close/borderline cliche, but they do work and do their magic ... believe me, they do float your boat (had to)","26 July 2022",8,3,9
"The Sea Beast","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free thoughts, please follow my blog :)

""The Sea Beast may follow familiar story beats, but Chris Williams still delivers one of the best animated movies of the year. The genuinely impressive animation stands out from the other technical elements, especially considering that virtually every scene includes water.

Accompanied by an adventurous epic score, characters receive efficient, thought-provoking arcs, conveying essential life lessons about understanding other perspectives and shamelessly accepting changes in our personal opinion, in addition to the evident premise of not judging a book by its cover.

Excellent voice work by the entire cast, namely Zaris-Angel Hator. Monster action is immensely entertaining for all types of viewers.

Couldn't recommend it more for a family watch.""

Rating: B+","17 July 2022",8,3,8
"The Sea Beast","This Netflix movie was a pleasant surprise a very Disney/Pixar type movie that I half expected to be only it wasnt on Disney+. But this had alot of the charm I would expect.

The characters are a joy to watch, Karl Urban delivers well as Jacab and Zaris-Angel Hator is a treat as Maise the young girl who wants to become one of the Hunters. Jared Harris as Captain Crow and Marianne Jean-Baptiste as Sarah Sharpe also deliver great character work. The acting is superb and this shows highlights who provide a mix of comedy and drama.

Some great animation too. Not all of it is a hit in fact the monsters felt more like How to Train Your Dragon inspired and very plain. And you have your cute little creatures in there too which is fine. I liked the design of Inevitable, the ship the Hunters sail, I just wish there would have been more creative design choices like that then again the characters are on the sea most of the time, so maybe it was understandable.

The Story also felt very one note, and while the message of the story was good it was very on the nose and cliché its a story that's been done many times before. I do feel there was a lakc of emotion in some scenes or the ability to have it play out more, even though the chemistry between Karl Urban and Zaris-Angel Hator is brilliant I felt there was something missing to the resolution to their friendship.

Lastly the ending of the movie rushed past very quickly. The build up to the end was well done and paced very smoothly but the last 15 minutes felt over very fast. I was expecting little more of an aftermath but, nope, just ended.

Not a perfect movie its let down in a few areas. Maybe not much for adults in terms of replayability but certainly worth a watch, but for kids I could very well see them enjoying this. Some great laughs and goofs to keep them entertained with a positive message at the end.","19 July 2022",7,3,5
"The Sea Beast","I've haven't liked Netflix Originals' Graphics in the past but this movie looks fantastic. The Sea Beast is by no means an original movie. I guarantee you that you've seen this story multiple times before. But that doesn't make it less entertaining. All that matters is the execution.

There are actually some thrilling action sequences in the first half and this movie is much more adventurous than I expected. It makes sense though, since this movie comes from the director of big hero 6. The movie makes perfect use of it's sea-pirates-adventure vibe. The characters are definitely cliche, but still likeable. The visuals and the animation in particular is gorgeous (Almost Pixar-level).

Overall, this is a funny, feel-good and light-hearted adventure.","26 July 2022",8,4,8
"The Sea Beast","This lazy preaching needs to end.

Same shtick as 1,000 other movies.

Kid is right. Adults are stupid & evil.

Movie looks good but the dialogue & story is predictably boring.

Just like a 1,000 other movies.

What a shame.","6 August 2022",1,8,21
"The Sea Beast","It's a lighthearted kids movie about making friends, a fun and cute one. It does push the graphics real hard though and environments looks absolutely fantastic.","11 July 2022",7,2,3
"The Sea Beast","This could've been THee animation movie of this year instead its now an inferior version of ""How to Train your Dragon""

the little girl is an awful addition ruining the relationship between the two main characters by interjecting as is she's an old ally

the talking and drama between action scenes is supremely irritating and highly unnecessary

the dumbness displayed by this new member of the crew is beyond sod possibility (like yeah obviously the crown peddled the lie who else could it have been in the whole wide world you idiot) and she's not disciplined or shown her place as she should be because she's a young but old enough kid is another irritation

i would hate for any real life explorer to be this level of a wannabee tryhard with pathetic moxie and no brains

what a shame!","13 July 2022",1,19,46
"The Sea Beast","The Sea Beast is an amazing animated film that I and my family loved! It has lots of hilarious moments and some sad moments. The cast is first class, and the movie is about fantasy, family and comedy.

The storyline follows an orphan girl named Masie (Zaris Angel Hator) who wants to be part of a ship's crew, but is too young to participate. However, after the ship almost sinks, Masie has an opportunity to be accepted by the crew and their leader Jacob (Karl Urban).

The Sea Beast is a fantastic movie. It has an exceptional combination of sad, funny and happy scenes. One of the sad scenes is when Masie tells the crew why she is an orphan living at a big orphanage and how her parents passed away when she was very young. There are also several funny scenes such as when Masie and Jacob travel inside of one of the sea beasts and explore the insides of the monster. Another funny one is when a sea beast named Red starts playing with Jacob, making him go up and down on a rope. One of my favorite scenes is when Masie finds a tiny sea creature and wants to keep it, although Jacob doesn't quite agree with her wishes. I love the animation; it looks so realistic. All the characters are wonderfully drawn and developed. Masie is terrific because she is so brave and persistent. She never gives up her dream of becoming a sea beast hunter or helping those she trusts and loves the most. There isn't much background music, but at times the music matches the scene perfectly like when everyone from the ship is at a bar and Masie tries to become one of them.

The message of The Sea Beast is that ""No matter who you are or what you look like you can do anything! And don't always believe the past.""

I give The Sea Beast 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 5 to 18, plus adults. It is available now on Netflix. By Keila V., KIDS FIRST!","3 August 2022",10,2,5
"The Sea Beast","Synopsis:
For generations, a war is going on between sea monsters and humans. When a little girl and a young hunter get separated from their group they find a reason to stop this war.

Cinematic Analysis:
Built on a premise similar to How to train your Dragon, Godzilla: King of Monsters and a little bit of Pirates of the Caribbean films, The Sea Beast is pretty much what one could expect it to be. It's easy to guess the ending but what matters is how we reach that conclusion. The story is simple and genuinely entertaining. We get a lot of fun moments and the film succeed in making us laugh numerous times. The animation is smooth, the quality is great and the monsters look super cool. The war scene at the beginning of the film is one of the best action sequences I've seen in recent times. It's a must for any animation movie to have compelling characters and The Sea Beast gives us quite a few of them.

A few of the weaknesses of this film are its predictability and less surprising moments, there was a chance to explore the monster island but we get to know very limited about it, and there is a mysterious lady subplot which in my opinion wasn't necessary and could have been achieved in a different way.

Conclusion:
No matter how similar and basic its plot seems to be, there is no doubt that The Sea Beast gives us a heartful story and has enough material to keep us submerged in its world from start to end.

Theme(s): Friendship, Compassion, War

A Fact for Fun: Some monsters in this film are way more dangerous than the dinosaurs of Jurassic World: Dominion.

"The Sea Beast","I enjoyed this one. It stars the voice-acting talent of Karl Urban(Dredd), an actor I like.

The story follows a little orphan girl, Maisie Brumble, who escapes from her orphanage and stows aboard The Inevitable where she befriends the friendly hunter Jacob Holland(Urban).

Soon the ship runs into difficulties and Maisie and Jacob are separated from their ship and a lot of adventures are to befall them.

Overall a very well animated and voice-acted animated C. G. I. Film suitable for people of all ages.","18 July 2022",7,2,5
"The Sea Beast","The Sea Beast.

The epic journey of a legendary sea monster hunter to make history ,when a young girl stows away on his ship.

First of all ,thank you Netflix for making this refreshing animated movie , just watch and chill .

It's been a long time since I watched an animation and this is definitely a good one to back again to these cute films.

Besides the amazing animations ,The sea beast was more than a fun story to enjoy it has a good depth ,it shows how imagination can be very meaningful .

However ,the story was a bit predictable , and after the magnificent first hour things turned to get slow and lose its taste . The visuals saved it anyway !

We don't talk about acting performances in this case ,but the voice acting performances were excellent ,especially for Karl Urban !","23 July 2022",7,3,7
"The Sea Beast","It's a good story with a strong moral lesson for all ages, wrapped up in a fine animated movie. It tells us how greed can start an endless war and hurt many sides. Stop the war! Let it end!

PS : I added an extra star for that cute and adorable Blue. That was a genius touch, no one can resist cuteness.","31 July 2022",7,2,4
"The Sea Beast","Plodding, largely joyless and predictable, with nothing to recommend it apart from some great visuals of the sea. ""How To Train Your Dragon"" did a much better job. Halfway through the ""cute"" monsters appear, making you wonder if the producers or scriptwriters did a sudden u-turn for some reason.","18 July 2022",3,10,17
"The Sea Beast","A cheap replica of how to train your dragon. Cliché predictable from the 1st scene. Such a waste of time. They just copied the whole animation without coming with any of their own creativity, even the monster red looks like white tooth like seriously what is that laziness.","1 August 2022",1,10,20
"The Sea Beast","Right up there with Disney and to a lesser extent, Pixar. Beautiful scenery. Fun plot. Lots for adults as well as children. Nice story. Well executed. Buried under the tons of other crap on Netflix and I think that has been to its detriment. Were it on any platform BUT Netflix, it would be a highly successful movie.

While it may be a bit predictable, it is still thrilling and worth a see because it it so well presented.","4 August 2022",9,2,4
"The Sea Beast","Though some character models are plane compared to the beautiful graphic, this movie almost had everything a great film needs. The creative world setting has shown very dramatically and beautifully by the awesome graphics and compositions. Storyline is simple yet still unpredictable and plants foreshadowing in smooth plot. Personally the main theme of the film, the importance of correction in history, is something that people don't really talk about, tend to be ignored, while it is very important to humanity. I felt that the film's ending is a bit rushing that it could have ended a little slower with some impact. But overall, definitely one of the best films ever created.","10 July 2022",8,7,14
"The Sea Beast","Captain Crow (Jared Harris) is one of the great monster hunters of his day. Jacob Holland (Karl Urban) is his loyal protégé on their ship ""The Inevitable"". The King and Queen are retiring all the monster hunters, and replacing them with the royal warship ""The Imperator"". Crow sets off on a final mission to hunt for the Red Bluster. Maisie Brumble is a stowaway. During the epic battle with the monster, Maisie cuts it loose to save the ship.

This is Netflix Animation. I don't know anything about their style of animation. This seems a little European. That may be the King and Queen which suggests an European country. The animation is a fraction below Moana. The monster is basically Godzilla. Like that franchise, there is a bit of distance between the human story and the monsters. The size difference really does generate a separation between the two levels. The story is simple and obvious. At its best, this movie has hints of ""How to Train Your Dragon"". I wonder if Netflix will continue with this franchise.","1 August 2022",6,2,7
"The Sea Beast","Positive: The Sea Beast is a well crafted animated movie with a bold story, well designed fantastic world setting and smooth musical scores.

Negative: There were some unnecessary setups in the narrative that didn't paid off at the end. I think the movie would have a better pacing without those unnecessary plot elements such as the merchant Gwen Batterbie.

I seen many reviews criticized The Sea Beast's narrative is being similar to How to Train Your Dragon. I might agree on that, but I found The Sea Beast much daring in its narrative tone and on its moral stand points.

Excluding those technical criticism, it also seems that, even this tiny pint of colonial critique in the fantastic story of The Sea Beasts was more than enough to freak out some people like the secretly proud majority and the supremacists.

I really enjoyed to watch The Sea Beasts, just because it was bold enough to touch on the colonialism topic on this age of post-truth. History is written by lies for the sake of the people in power, and there is nothing wrong to use this as a plot tool for the fantastic world of The Sea Beast.","3 August 2022",8,4,6
"The Sea Beast","This film reminds me of that old place over in eastern Phoenix with the statue of a priests neck. The worlds like a trackor, always brushing up against us trying to show us pictures of mouths. In ""the sea beast"" a plain unmarked white truck is given a routine stop by a police officer. A moth wearing a cape steps out of a driver seat with a suitcase full of pictures of smiling people that belong to the human family.","11 July 2022",10,5,21
"The Sea Beast","Forced Characters, pushed a square into a peg... doesn't work at all. The unrealistic representation of very identity makes the film boring and cliche. It's painful to watch.","12 July 2022",1,37,81
"The Sea Beast","The graphics are very good. Much detail!

I like the underlying story of what ""fake"" stories can do to our society. Who benefits from our actions? Very good movie!","10 July 2022",8,7,12
"The Sea Beast","From all the Netflix Original animatec family films I've seen this is tge inly in that rivals Disney. The animation and sound is great, and put that alongside a very interesting world whith two great charecters and a good story snd you've got a great film for all ages.

There are sone inconsistencies and the story arc is very predictable and lacking foreshadowing hence why it's not 9 stars.

Also the ending doesn't dissappint like other Netflix Originals.","4 August 2022",8,2,3
"The Sea Beast","Wasn't expecting much. Great film, and the underlying message I took from it was that old books are not necessarily true. Great animation, and fun/cute story for the kids. Top animated movie in my book.","15 July 2022",8,2,2
"The Sea Beast","This movie is very much like How to Train Your Dragon for me but it has some issues that I can't get over that's preventing me from rating this movie higher.

Voice acting was phenomenalAnimation was spot onStory left me with a few questions and obvious and unexplainable plot holes.

Whoever wrote the script did a jolly good job!","12 July 2022",8,3,6
"The Sea Beast","The main characters are fully-realized, intelligent, and likable! None of them were annoying, which I honestly expected. They all get satisfying arcs. Even the most minor of characters are likable! The comic relief creature was cute and never felt overbearing!

The voice acting is great, even from the young girl.

The animation is beautiful.

There was some good lines! There was some dialogue that kind-of teetered on inaccurate to the time period but I forgot about it right away.

There was good reincorporation!

The monsters are so cool!

There's some genuinely creepy imagery!

It doesn't feel its runtime at all!

My expectations were subverted many times!

The humor never felt inorganic and was actually funny!

The music is memorable and appropriately used!

The action is fun and even intense at points!

Definitely one of the best animated films to come out this year! I can see myself watching this again at some point. And as a lover of the ocean and of monsters, I am very satisfied! (Yeah, I have a bit of a bias but, eh, what're you gonna do?)","15 July 2022",7,2,5
"The Sea Beast","Great story with awesome characters. The animation was superb. One of the best computer animated movies of all time. Great for kids and adults as well. Oceans of fun for the whole family (pun intended). Watch out Pixar!","23 July 2022",9,5,14
"The Sea Beast","Totally a outstanding one. The Animation was so good to watch. Even the story also mind blowing. Seriously just go and watch it, and come again to give 10* rating.","14 July 2022",10,4,9
"The Sea Beast","This was a wild, beautiful and enduring adventure. If you loved ""How To Train A Dragon"", you'll certainly love this movie.

But this movie is a bit more serious. It speaks of war, equality, dictatorship, capitalism, race and peace.

You have to really watch the movie with an open mind and find its deeper meaning. It's not hard if you already have an open heart.

The use of race, varying genders and a variety of different humans in these characters wasn't just to be ""woke"", but to bring the ultimate plot to its head.

A child will enjoy its beauty and action, but any empathetic and educated adult will see its intelligence.

Bravo.","15 July 2022",10,3,7
"The Sea Beast","What a fantastic Animated movie! An imaginative world, likable characters, great monster design and some of the best visuals that are on par with what Disney and Pixar's best productions, all wrapped together in an engaging and well paced story.

To be fair, the premise is not the most most original one, half Moby Dick, half How to train your Dragon with a good dose of Pirates of the Caribbean mixed in, a lot of plots and themes feel very familiar and safe, but they are executed well and expert;y mixed together.

The technical side is a true highlight, the underwater shots are amongst the best I've ever seen in an CGI movie. The voice cast is really good without exception, helped by the fact that the dialogue is kept in a consistent tone fitting the depicted period (no distracting modern language if a few fun exceptions).

The movie should work best for older kids , teens and adults, there is not enough humor in it and some central themes (revenge) are a bit heavy for younger kids. It is tonally closest to the How to Train Your Dragon sequels, which I loved.

The best animated movie I have seen in a while, I hope Netflix can keep up with this level of quality in the future to shake up the Disney/Pixar monopoly a bit!","2 September 2022",9,2,3
"The Sea Beast","It's like how to train your dragon mixed with Pirates of the Caribbean... not in a good way.

Well-made, of course, I feel like nowadays it won't be a problem for those big studios to make good films with the technologies and artists they have. But the story is sooooo cliche... and dull. The characters seem like they are from different universes, they are kind of in different styles. Marie looks really generic, the design has nothing special. Also I have to mention that the main reason I don't like this movie is mostly from Masie. I don't like her personality, her story is super flat, and she just suddenly joined the team. I mean, come on... You can do it better.

The beasts are cute and that's probably it.","19 July 2022",5,7,12
"The Sea Beast","This new movie from Netflix is a great addition to all the great-looking animated movies. ""The Sea Beast"" looks amazing as they use water and the ocean to tell a stunning story through the animation. Although the animation is stunning, the story and characters feel very similar to other animated movies, most notably ""How to train your Dragon"". The titular sea beast acts a lot like Toothless from those movies, and the other characters feel like they are from other movies too.

It was a very emotional and touching story that felt recycled but the movie was a very fun, and exciting time.","15 July 2022",8,2,3
"The Sea Beast","It reminds me of the Nintendo game The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker

It takes cues from few different movies and manages to create something unique and charming. The action sequences are thrilling, really blockbuster material. If you like adventure movies in the vein of The Pirates of The Caribbean, and indeed How To Train A Dragon, then you're in for a treat. The movie was created by some ex Disney guys who worked on Moana and some other Disney titles. And it shows, the movie has really high animation quality, it blends photo realistic aspects with a very vibrant cartoony style.","9 July 2022",10,12,30
"The Sea Beast","Karl Urban tackles yet another English accent in 'The Sea Beast (2022)', an animated adventure that focuses on a series of conflicts between pirate-like hunters and kaiju-like beasts on the choppy waters of the seven seas. With a no-frills yet pleasing aesthetic complete with delightfully well-rendered water and hair, the feature tells its simple yet effective story with quiet confidence. Its animation is energetic and enjoyable, bringing to life both its surprisingly exciting action and its softer character moments. Though the narrative is slightly generic and even somewhat unrefined on occasion, it does an admirable job at conveying its underlying anti-hunting and (more surprisingly) anti-monarchy themes. It remains entertaining for its duration, despite the fact that it's arguably a bit too long and it drags somewhat in its midsection. Some of its character arcs are a tad rushed, but most of them avoid falling entirely into stereotype (even if just barely). The flick has just the right amount of edge to it, featuring a number of moments which almost threaten to cross the line into PG-13 territory, and that helps it carve out its own place within its genre. It's a fairly fun affair that, somewhat ironically, plays it by the book. It's nice to see a proper pirate picture again.","30 August 2022",6,1,3
"The Sea Beast","Utterly predictable. This has very little content story-wise. The animations are great, but besides that not much to look at. I really wish they had invested more effort into making a good story (especially considering the strong setup with high potentiality.","13 August 2022",6,2,4
"The Sea Beast","This is a friggen cartoon yet I'm blown away by the storytelling. Well done and a fine update to... oh belay that. This is a story that contrasts reality with fake news, and careers with family... well done. I do, however, despise the new cliche of ""child of color"" is more stable and knowledgeable than heterosexual white male... constantly... for the entire movie.","17 July 2022",9,3,9
"The Sea Beast","I'm a grown man and I had to hold back tears at several points in this movie. Just a wonderful movie for all ages. Surprisingly deep characterizations and incisive. There was one scene (no spoilers!) that reminded of War and Peace in a way... the inevitability of conflict. And done very well too, and put in ways that both children and adults can understand. Also some heavy literary references, especially to the old testament and Moby Dick. Really, really under appreciated movie and I can't recommend it enough.

Some of the more topical political overtones were a bit ham-handed, but eh, not really more so that what Hollywood has been churning out these days...

Oh--it's also very thrilling and the animation is incredible!

Bravo, Netflix!","12 July 2022",9,4,8
"The Sea Beast","This is by far the best cartoon I have seen in a few years...and I have been a diehard Disney fan for years and have been to Disney world 4 times in the past 2 years...but I have not allowed my kids to watch the last 3 animated cartoons Disney has put out and that is extremely disappointing. So this movie was such a breath of fresh air! It's gorgeous and it has that bit of Moana feeling to it. I don't know that I would compare it to How to Train Your Dragon like a lot of people previously have...because I didn't care for those movies much and I love The Sea Beast. I would prefer there wasn't some mild language, but nothing is perfect. That's the main reason I gave it a 9. But the story is beautiful and the characters are easily liked...it's worth watching on your next family movie night. You won't be sorry! Disney will have some MAJOR competition if Netflix keeps cranking them out like this one.","4 August 2022",9,2,3
"The Sea Beast","Very predictable yes. Very similar to how to train your dragon. Almost like a copy of it, but its a movie for kids. And it is produced by netflix. This is on cinema movie level. Good graphics, music. Also story not so bad... Nice movie for kids. I would like to see more movies like this one.","11 July 2022",9,3,6
"The Sea Beast","This movie is a very feel-good movie, the actions scenes felt very realistic. The animations and there movements are very realistic especially the scenes in water. I loved the blue beast... It's very cute.... The main character dubbed by karl urban, his accent is very nice to here, i like it from the series the boys.","20 July 2022",9,3,6
"The Sea Beast","The plot is similar but has some variations. But it's still a good movie. Only one part got unexplored. The witch was built up too much and there was no information about her after they leave from her place.

Overall, it's a decent movie that can be enjoyed by people of all ages. Watch it even if you watched HTTYD.","13 July 2022",7,2,7
"The Sea Beast","My husband and I enjoyed watching this film! We watched it as a preview before allowing our 5 year old and 3 year old watch it. For our children it would be too scary. The creatures themselves aren't actually too menacing looking and the story itself is absolutely fun for kids, it's the fight scenes between man and beast that are intense and occasionally scary.

My husband and I truly enjoyed it though! We laughed and were engrossed in the story. We'll watch it with our kiddos for sure once they're a bit older!","16 July 2022",9,4,6
"The Sea Beast","Grey slop structured around the message of anti-traditionalism.

"The Sea Beast","Here's The 4K Lowedown on ""Sea Beast"" (PG - 2022 - Netflix)
Genre: Animated/Family

My Score: 7.8
Cast=6 Acting=7 Plot=8 Ending=9 Story=9
Art=8 Voice=10 Music=6 Family=8 Funny=7

When a young girl stows away on the ship of a legendary sea monster hunter, they embark on an epic journey into uncharted waters to hunt the Red Bluster

""Aye, they were heroes...but you can be a hero and still be wrong."" This was basically How to Train your Dragon with sea monsters...and I enjoyed it a lot. The real surprise comes from the cast, whom I recognized by name but not by their voice. The captain was like Ahab in Moby Dick, so I think it appeals to the adult audience with the story. I think the children like it because of the child lead and the colorful monsters. I have seen this several times now because my granddaughter loves it...it is well worth a watch.","30 August 2022",8,1,3
"The Sea Beast","I've not seen any of the other animated movies people are comparing it to but this is a top notch film, reminds me of Jaws when they battle the shark at sea. Beutiful animation and some cool sea battles. Reminds me of those old maps with the sea monsters drawn in.

Whats not to like?","14 July 2022",8,3,9
"The Sea Beast","The story. The animation. The Graphics. The dialogue. The character. The overall vibe. AWESOME.

Loved the concept and the beast obvious.

The kid was nice too.

One thing I have to mention is that now a days I feel that the stories are becoming similar day by day. I mean I kind of felt it was a story I have heard or seen someplace and not a unique or new. But beside this small drawback (which is very personal) I think its a overall an awesome movie.","20 July 2022",9,3,8
"The Sea Beast","The visuals are amazing, I love that it's stylized. I really hope that cg animations become more like this, like how the old cartoon animated movies had fun with their designs.

The body language, facial expressions, how they talk, and how the communication between person and beast is. It's very fluid and believable. Very lively.

The realism is in the right places, no crossing into the uncanny valley like a lot of realistic cg films may do.

The characters are fun, they're interesting, they're dynamic. They have realistic reactions.

The monster designs are lovely. I especially love the Brickleback, very faithful to the medieval depictions of sea monsters.

The water graphics are stunning! The Inevitable ship is also a wonderfully cool design.

(I also believe that Blue is one of those deep sea eel-like ones that were in a huge group, it would make sense.)
All-in-all I adore this movie. My new all-time favourite. I adore the piratey stuff, sea monsters, the whole time is by the ocean or in the ocean. Nearly everything I already love.

Definitely recommend.","7 August 2022",9,2,2
"The Sea Beast","This is a great family fun. The story may not be groundbreaking, but that doesn't matter. It's a simple story handled very well. The details of all the characters is just amazing, the animation is just gorgeous to look at. And Karl Urban....what else need to be said. You want an enjoyable family movie in the evening? Watch this.","29 July 2022",8,2,4
"The Sea Beast","Don't look for smth you already know or any connection with real life, just have a pleasure to deep dive in your child dreams we here d DD mtg is very simple and primitive and something is no-possible even imagine... the best I ever seen for last 5 years, don't understand why rate is not so big so should be, even for new version of Superpets it's bigger (no even comparable pictures on my choice..). Hope it's just because not many already seen this. Recommend to do this asap, it's worth of it - I switch on for my son 11 years old, but in 7 minutes together with husband we were before screen . Need to highlight separately very detailed visualization - it was real rest after very simple animations and same visual heroes that coming from picture to picture. We all were impressed!","10 September 2022",10,3,5
"The Sea Beast","It starts off great as a rip-roaring sea faring adventure with a solid premise and over the top acrobatic action, but ends up spoiled by being too twee and childish with its moral agenda. The animation is superb but the beasts are quite basic looking and don't look menacing. The cute one does look cute and is quite funny, but the main beast is little more than a shape with eyes. Great music, some good humour and a multi-cultural cast of albeit stereotypical characters means there's still stuff to enjoy, but it gets too silly and didn't live up to its initial impression.

Reluctantly, my overall score is 5/10.","30 August 2022",5,1,4
"The Sea Beast","Great flick for everyone, especially kids. I love how the animosity between the beasts and human kind is based upon lies laid down in history books by past authorities. This is an essential concept to pass onto children. So as they can learn to question things they read, particularly our real world 'his'-story.

At present, China has initiated a campaign to whitewash the history of Hong Kong from the citizens minds, with children being their primary targets. Similar has happened with disinformation from Catholics about the extent of murder and cruelty in the crusades, and by the Indonesian authorities on the true perpetrators and events that consisted the 1966 genocide in Indonesia. The list goes on.

Always question Authority.","13 September 2022",10,1,2
"The Sea Beast","Awe are completely in love with this movie. The scenes are edge of your seat amazing, the acting is brilliant, and the entire story line is epic. It challenges the way you think and makes you smile.","11 July 2022",10,4,11
"The Sea Beast","It's obviously not going to have as complex writing or plot as something meant only for adults. I didn't have any problems with this movie, I'm 22 and really enjoyed it. Rate this movie for what it's going for, which it achieved and did well. I had a good idea of how this movie was going to end in the first 20 minutes, but I still enjoyed watching every second. Watch the 6th sense, looper, 7, etc. If you want unpredictable mind boggling twists, not a kids/family oriented movie.","14 August 2022",10,2,3
"The Sea Beast","It's theme is basic, similar to the famous Melville's Orca, the captain obsessed with capturing no, killing it more like because the great Red Beast has been taking many ships down. It's a legend itself, the beast.

Killing the poor animal supposed to bring fame and fortune. Bla, bla, bla.

I'd stopped fully paying attention - catching only the glimpses here and there.","11 August 2022",8,1,2
"The Sea Beast","The water animation was so good, my Dad thought it was a live-action movie.

Pixar and Dreamwork have dominated the animation industry but Netflix Animation is showing that they can deliver an animation film just as good. It's a thrilling voyage with a lot of heart.

The sea action is fun and exciting and the beast action is awesome. There is an action sequence here that reminded me of Godzilla. There is also great voice acting from the cast with Karl Urban doing a great job as the main lead and Jared Harris being phenomenal as Captain Crow. The dialogue is also well written and genuinely funny at times.

The only flaws I found is that the plot is quite predictable and the story leaves some unanswered questions that seem to be purposely done for a potential sequel.

Other than that, it is great to have an original animation movie that is enjoyable.","16 September 2022",8,1,3
"The Sea Beast","Don't understand anyone who can watch this movie and claim it's ""woke"". These reviewers are constantly bombing movies because their lives are pathetic. It's a movie, with a simple message. Characters were great and it was entertaining. Blow my mind people can't just watch a movie to be entertained. Always has some hidden political meaning that's against their agenda.","13 July 2022",9,5,7
"The Sea Beast","""And a child will lead them"". On the surface, this is a movie about a transformational relationship between a man and a child. On the bigger scale, it is a story about challenging old archetypes. I'd be very interested in hearing more from the writer and director on their takeaways for the movie. The animation is gorgeous. The casting is wonderful. The story is both fun and purposeful. It is being hailed as Netflix's salvo to HOW TO TRAIN A DRAGON. This is a great family film. I give this film a 7 (beautifully entertaining) out of 10. {Animated Adventure}","15 July 2022",7,1,7
"The Sea Beast","The Sea Beast is a genuinely decent movie about fury and redemption while also being fun for the family. Although it does remind me of the classic 2010 movie, How To Train Your Dragon; however it looks past this comparison and becomes enjoyable with its colourful charm.","9 July 2022",7,5,10
"The Sea Beast","Its story within and speaks wild life conservation, marine conservation, black-lives-matter, children's rights, gender equality and the meanings of chosen family fervently, plus a little spin about the ship science. Many other great stories have shown us what it means to be a hero, just wait till you look deep into those huge eyes of The Sea Beast!","29 July 2022",7,2,6
"The Sea Beast","Anything i write is less than what i saw and what i felt. I gave 9 out of 10 because the beast looked cartoonish , yeah i know it is a cartoon but as human character and Beast character seemed a different , In my opinion the beast should get more intention to show how much dangerous a beast can be.

After all ""you can't judge by look or outfit""

but beside those the message lies within touched me.","12 July 2022",9,4,9
"The Sea Beast","It's amazing to me how adult keyboard warriors get on here and trash a kid's movie because the main character is a little Black girl. Some of you can suspend reality long enough to watch a movie about giant sea creatures, but you draw the line at Black characters. Makes no sense, whatsoever.

Also, some of the reviews call this little girl, ""spoiled,"" ""bratty,"" ""know-it-all,"" and ""sassy."" Yet, her larger than life personality is literally no different than the likes of Merida from ""Brave."" But I think we know why characters like Merida are acceptable whereas Maisie Brumble isn't.

That being said, this KID'S movie is great for the family, and I had fun watching it. I guarantee your little ones will enjoy it, too...especially since they are innocents who haven't been jaded by prejudice and bigotry.","17 July 2022",8,4,8
"The Sea Beast","Nothing better than a movie based on pirates, with mythological creatures and sea shanties! Not to mention the mesmerizing graphics of the movie, the story might be predictable and.. lack in some of it's moments, but it certainly makes up for it.

The characters are charming, the environmental design is incredible, and while the story is predictable, there are twists and turns.

I've stopped watching animated films for a long while, thought I was too old for this.

You're never too old. We just learn to act like it. This movie brought a smile to my face, and made me appreciate animated movies the way I used to appreciate them as a kid.","15 July 2022",9,4,7
"The Sea Beast","Sometimes the animations is very good, sometimes is just ok...
The story? Simple, basic... Same old beaten path and a bit inspired.

Biggest fault? The same old political agenda: everyone older is greedy, aggressive and stupid, the younger you are the wiser you are.... And if you happen to be the character of a white, mature man, well, you are will be portrayed as a total idiot.

To be fair, this starts to appear like prejudice and racism...","1 August 2022",6,2,5
"The Sea Beast","A great family film And a brilliant watch! Funny in places and a really good story line. Me and my daughter really enjoyed it. Netflix done a good job on this considering the other crap they have produce lately.","17 July 2022",7,2,4
"The Sea Beast","The result of How to Train your Dragon meets Pirates of the Caribbean, The Sea Beast is a wonderful story with an engaging plot and wonderful charchter arc. We follow pirate Jacob Holland and his captain of the ship Crow on their quest to free the ocean from beasts that threaten the life of folks for centuries. As the story goes they meet Maisie, a fallen's pirate daughter who also dreams of becoming one, she is the reason of the story's twist and the factor that starts other charachters development. Speaking of the them, most important ones have clear personality and complexity and you feel and understand their motives. The action of the story is remarcable and the pacing is on point, it's accompanied by a great pirate score and nice vibe. The animation is colorful and all the actors do a great job. The only negatives I found to question are some plot conveniences that were necesary to move it forward and some charachters motives that I found questionable(trying to keep it as much spoiler free as possible).

In conclusion I found myself suprised by Netflix's yet another good animated film after last year's Mithcels vs Machines and one more succes by Chris Williams

Highly recommend 8/10.","21 July 2022",8,3,6
"The Sea Beast","This movie went above my expectations! It's a very good family friendly movie that I think most will ages will appreciate. Also a VERY pretty movie and the animations is really good! I had not heard of this movie at all and honestly wasn't going to watch it BUT it should be more hyped and I think it's one of the better family friendly movies I've watched in a while. It's a very wholesome story and I really like that it shows that family isn't always blod. I would really have liked if the ending was longer, I want to know more what happened after all this and especially how her future turned out! I highly recommend!","5 November 2022",9,1,1
"The Sea Beast","I loved this movie. The story was super compelling, the characters were great, the plot was great, the storytelling was classic and had all of the elements of a great traditional story. I was reminded of Sinbad and How to train your dragon. It was very nice to see an animated movie besides Disney that was captivating and super entertaining. Highly recommend this one.","10 August 2022",9,1,1
"The Sea Beast","Cringey, terrible voice acting, it sounds like they got an upper class rich kid to do the voice of the main little girl. The acting is just so bad. Too predictable and is a poor mans how to train your dragon.

I really wish people would stop making clones of other movies.","10 July 2022",1,31,80
"The Sea Beast","This is a wonderful story, it has tremendous graphics, the art work is truly awesome. Sadly the voice artists are mostly dreadful and all I kept hearing was ""gor blimey Mary Poppins"" as dreadful accent and truly dreadful accent continued to grate on my nerves! Sadly a potentially 5star film demoted to 1and half stars, purely because they used really nasty voice actors.

If you're going to use an American or New Zealand actor, don't have them use a mock cockney accent. There was no need for such dreadful accents.

Otherwise a lovely family movie, I genuinely laughed at the ""Bollox"" reference, clearly film makers had no clue but it was subt, quick funny and not worth dismissing.","9 July 2022",3,5,19
"The Sea Beast","I was not expecting much. But the first half was very good. Sure it was predictable, but it was also entertaining. A Moby Dick story about a world full of monsters that will definitely kill you if you give them any slack..And the rites of passage for a young man about to become captain, and the Captain unsure of what he will do afterwards.

All this gets literally flushed down the toilet, where in the 2nd half of the movie is actually a completely different movie all together. We are introduced to a young girl that befriends a cute blue creature that will not leave saddled with trying to become friends with the Dragon..i mean sea monster. It becomes so childish, so dumb..And then there is magic. WTF.... You cant just introduce magic halfway into a movie that except for the giant sea monsters, is grounded in reality.

I dont know if i can eve watch the 2nd half its so bad. I dont want to.

So i went back and watched the 2nd half after reading the reviews...it does get better indeed...BUt why inclued a halftime show that is meant for 3 year olds...alienating adults in the process..meanwhile after that immediately goes back to being an adult movie.","28 September 2022",8,0,1
"The Sea Beast","You wont be dissapointed. The animation, the music, the visuals, and the characters are all well done. I now wish there was a game much like this, but hey there is so I now feel it is time to return to Black Desert Online to hunt sea monsters.","19 July 2022",9,3,8
"The Sea Beast","By the standards of a typical Netflix movie, ""The Sea Beast"" is actually a surprisingly strong animated feature, creating a sprawling family adventure that contains the grandiose spectacle & wonder you'd usually associate with a tale as big as this (uncharacteristically rivalling Pixar, DreamWorks & Sony), whilst retaining an authentic sense of heart with a relevant, meaningful thematic message delivered at the end.

Granted, it's not an original fantasy concept in the slightest (""How To Train Your Dragon"" but with kaiju dwelling in oceanic depths) but it does just enough to validate its own existence & set itself apart from the rest - to feel satisfying by the conclusion. Plus, rarely do movies on the streaming service look this cinematic & sequences throughout are beautifully rendered.","16 January 2023",7,0,0
"The Sea Beast","Every minute of this movie is worth your time - from the heart pounding opening sequence to the very last frame.

The animation was absolutely astounding, the storyline was thought-provoking and compelling, and the characters were relatable. (The inclusion of different types of people, collectively working together with mutual respect in a united front, was another bonus) Both children and adults alike will be able to see a bit of themselves in an array of characters.

Although I do agree with other reviewers that the emotion of ""empathy"" was portrayed clearer in a memorable scene of ""How to Train Your Dragon"", I think overall this movie adds many more valuable lessons that HTTYD wasn't quite able to convey - all while being much, much more inclusive. (For the win!)

If there was ever an animated film worth a 10, this is it! Catch up, Disney, because the world is evolving - with or without you.","23 July 2022",10,6,14
"The Sea Beast","First of all, i have to say that this film gave me everything I was asking for, a good dialogues, characters with something to say, pretty animals, and all of that. Definitely this is another level for the animation.

And whil I was watching it, every like 15 minutes another film came to my mind and i was thinking ""Oh, this is like another movie"" wich i don´t blame, but is something that a lot of people are talking about and I completely understand, but I don´t mind.

A great movie about and adventure with rare creatures, but this isn´t something we haven´t seen before, however is really fun.","15 July 2022",7,1,3
"The Sea Beast","While reasonably entertaining, I was disappointed after all the positive reviews. The biggest letdown is the script--its extremely pedestrian dialogue really could have used a lot of punching up. Also the characters models (Jacob especially, but an exception is Sarah Sharp, who looks fantastic) and facial animation are quite generic. (BTW, although this film is presented in Dolby Vision and generally looked pretty good on my LG OLED, it--like several other recent Netflix original animated films--is oddly not presented in native 4K but only in HD. I can tell because my Nvidia Shield engaged its enhanced upscaling which it does not do if the material is streamed in 4K.)","9 July 2022",6,7,24
"The Sea Beast","Maybe I expected too much from the maker of Moana and Big Hero 6 but this movie is just horrible, a dime in a dozen movie. This kind of animation story is made at least a 1000 times and here's just another one. Full of cliche, weak, boring and stupid characters. Even the ending of this boring movie is a big predictable, Woke, cliche. You can clearly see that Netflix has cut considerably on the budget and that is why you get this 2 hours of pure dullness in a very bad movie.","26 July 2022",1,10,25
"The Sea Beast","It was a beautiful and upbeat movie with an even lovelier message. Perhaps we do get things wrong in our quest to evolve. Perhaps we do not need to give in to fear to learn. By working with our world instead of always trying to dominate everything, we could evolve more and with a whole new understanding of unity. A recommend for even adults as the message is one that should be passed on. Total thumbs up.","13 August 2022",10,1,3
"The Sea Beast","The first half of this film was incredible! All of the characters were likable and seemed to have very interesting back stories. The world they built here is really interesting and there is so much potential for a great storyline. Unfortunately the last 30 minutes or so is way too rushed! The plotlines all just kind of resolve themselves with a whimper and it leaves you wanting more. It almost feels like this was meant to be a series instead of a film. So close to being legendary! Hopefully they explore the world a bit more in a sequel.","12 July 2022",8,2,3
"The Sea Beast","I never liked the stories where humans slay the predators in nature. It's too simple and there doesn't seem to be a reverance behind it, only a desire to find the beast and kill it. Sure, the graphics are great and so on, and the girl has a beautiful spirit and everything. So what happens when the monsters have all been killed?","12 July 2022",5,1,9

First, I want to say that maybe it was just me, but it seemed like the animation in the first 10 minutes or so felt SUPER outdated-like watching a remastered ""Bugs Life"" or ""Antz""...I was like, ""what in the world is this cheap/on a budget animation?"" (LOL LOL). It definitely got better though.

This was definitely cute, but it doesn't really have any lasting impressions for me. It was a pretty straight forward story that was good, but it felt a little lazy in terms of adding depth to some of the tension. But again, Zaris-Angel Hator did a great job as the lead character Maisie. I really enjoyed her overall youthful spirit exuding through the character.

I can see this possibly getting some award recognition for animation and/or effects. Maybe not a win, but definitely recognition for some of the animation choices...but those first few minutes might get in the way, because that animation looked a little archaic LOL

OTHER THOUGHTS:
Highlights: Zaris-Angel Hator as Maisie, the hair texture animation, thematic followthrough, the ocean animation during the storm, Blue, the first encounter / ""fight"" with Red and the hunters, Mrs. Merino (if having one job and never missing was a person LOL), the transitions between scenes, and the visuals of the kingdom.

Could've Been Better: Giving more to the King and Queen's motivations, more background or references to Gwen, and the ""beastly"" look to the sea beasts.","22 July 2022",8,1,5
"The Sea Beast","I'm sure this title has been taken because let's be honest, we're all thinking the same thing. This was a really well done and visually amazing movie, with a very familiar plot line. That of course being the one from 'How to Train Your Dragon'. It's virtually identical, except it uses sea monsters instead of dragons, and pirates instead of vikings. Not there was anything necessarily wrong with that because I thought it was great. Though, the movie title seemed a tad uninspired.

Karl Urban is the man, so naturally he made the film better.

In conclusion, it's a fun family film suited for all ages, including adults.","19 November 2022",8,0,0
"The Sea Beast","At first glance the story just brought the text book sea hunters story. But the more we watch, the more the story turn into an unexpected direction...

Usually I despised child-lead character in a movie, because it was too dangerous and careless of course. But this one was different, I like Maisie coming in the story not being the know-it-all, but she challenged the old fashion way of the hunting of the beast. Not to mention the chemistry with Jacob is awesome, Karl Urban did a very good job in voicing Jacob... this was really adventurous and way too funny... I just love every moment of the movie...

This one is a definite must watch list!","14 July 2022",10,2,6
"The Sea Beast","The lack of action, forced copied ideas with goofy pets, not to mention the design of it, just not from this movie, no offense. I didn't like the ""big"" red monster design either. Didn't felt like he was the main target or the ""big boss"". Maybe it was intentional, who am I to question? Poor presentation of the story/point. It made it dull, hard passing and predictable. And for the love of the lord, what habe they done with Karl's voice? I didn't feel like it was him. Mostly Cilian Murphy or Matt Ryan with a cold. I like that the pirates are getting more attention now, but not like these. Make it better, Netflix! Peace & Love, lads!","19 July 2022",7,0,6
"The Sea Beast","Animation looks cheap and story is blunt and boring. Compared to Dreamworks or Pixar movies, this looks like lazy low budget indie movie. I know that this is one of Netflix's first animated movies, but I hope they will invest more into it, at least to make a story that makes sense.","18 July 2022",4,5,10
"The Sea Beast","This film is basically How To Train Your Dragon but with pirates and sea monsters. And I liked it for that. The animation is beautiful throughout, the monster is actually kinda creepy. When the two main characters are in the water and they see the beast staring at them, it is pretty freaky. Which is rarely a thing I can say about children films. This film although sometimes to much like How To Train Your Dragon hits all the right notes. The voice acting is also well done, the writing mostly goes well. But I think its main problem is that it doesn't try to be original. It heavily relies on films you have seen like it. It follows tropes you have seen a lot. But I like the film. Overall its a fun adventure film on the sea that can definitely benefit from a sequel or TV show.","13 September 2022",8,0,1
"The Sea Beast","This movie started out with a bang. The animation was brilliant, the writing was good, and it felt like the plot was going to be creative and unique. Things started to fall apart along the way, however. As great as the animation is for the majority of the movie, it looks like the filmmakers ran out of money when it came to animating the most important part...the monsters! Also, you could tell that there was an intentional focus on trying to create as much diversity as possible as female and minority characters kept on popping up in much greater numbers than one would expect in the context of this movie. Finally, the plot, which started out with intriguing possibilities, became cliché and formulaic. The movie was good but could've been so much better.","12 July 2022",7,1,5
"The Sea Beast","I'm 52 and enjoyed this movie very much.

It's well written, the dialogs are good, the graphics are excellent and all the feeling was great.

It's a very enjoyable movie.","16 July 2022",10,4,9
"The Sea Beast","You read the positive review here and you think tyou're gonna watch a fun and sweet movie, but then you watch the movie and then it turns out to be just junk. A 'story' about a spoiled child with a big mouth, well this is the story nothing else happened. And what is that blonde guy supposed to be a wannabee Kristoff?!","28 July 2022",1,10,21
"The Sea Beast","I read good things about this film, so I was interested in seeing whether the reviews were accurate. They were. This is a fun movie filled with adventure, thrills, gorgeous animation and a terrific story about redemption and kindness.","30 July 2022",9,2,5
"The Sea Beast","I think kids will relish it and adults will be able to use it to teach about colonialism and how the west teaches a false hero. Some funny accents and sea farer lingo!","11 July 2022",9,5,14
"The Sea Beast","Nice animation, dialogues, entertaining story and important underlying themes. No doubt worth a watch and a recommendation. Creators did a really good job on this one.","23 July 2022",9,3,7
"The Sea Beast","Animals deserve to live great lives. What an amazing movie with mature storytellings and metaphors for the real world. We need more movies like this one.","11 July 2022",10,6,17
"The Sea Beast","In a Pool Of Forgettable Movies To Dump On a Steaming Service, This One Should Be In Theatres In Imax, Universal Story Of Friendship, Revenge Tale, Monster Vs Man And Many More, Just Watch The Movie For Yourself Now. It's Amazing.","13 July 2022",10,4,6
"The Sea Beast","An apt analogy to real world conflicts. Anyone who knows anything about geopolitics knows ""war is big business"". The mechanics behind conflicts can be quite complex, but understanding the mechanics in this story's plot gives one a good start. So this movie has a value far beyond it's excellent entertainment value.

Why then not 10/10? It could have expanded on the reality generally speaking, although not ALL of these dangerous titanic creatures are predatory monsters, a few might actually be, a fact which serves the liars who write the kingdom's lore. In our real world, this is also true. Not understanding this nuance makes one vulnerable to manipulations which started the conflict, and could re-start it. But that would be a very difficult narrative to weave in without making this artful creation confusing and gaudy.","13 July 2022",9,3,6
"The Sea Beast","No spoilers here, but its really good.

I watched this with my 7 year old son today, and he loved it and i loved it too.

Its looks amazing, the story is decent for a kids movie, but even as an adult i really liked it.

More like this please netflix!","7 August 2022",9,2,5
"The Sea Beast","So much beyond a regular kid's story I thought it'd be. Its a striking allegory to what we fight wars about in real life. Seemingly a fun adventure in the same vain of Moby Dick, Its main theme turns out to be antiestablishment, disecting the way the rich and powerful use propaganda to spur regular folk against each other, a painful and purposed divisioning that enables the privileged to keep and grow their privilege. Its such a fresh change of pace from Disney's obsession with princesses, as if we haven't long grown out of that stage. Its topical as the propaganda machine is even worse now than at any time in history. I hope people see this film and be inspired to be more critical and just educated of whatever info they digest.","3 September 2022",10,2,4
"The Sea Beast","So I saw this was released few days ago and didn't even think about it just another Netflix movie...
My god !! I'm soo wrong this is brilliant story heartbreaking message and what we need these days in this cruel world...
If you have time watch this....!

P. S. I watched this because of the Billy Butcher 🤓. I'm so happy I did check this out...","20 July 2022",9,2,6
"The Sea Beast","Story starts out strong but goes downhill halfway through. Villain's arc is not well defined and too many plots end unresolved.

Dialogue is great. Cast is overall good. Karl Urban is the clear standout, who does a fantastic job bringing Jacob to life.

I enjoyed the movie, wish it didn't wrap up so hastily.","13 July 2022",7,2,5
"The Sea Beast","I found myself enjoying this movie a lot more than I expected to. The story drags a little in places, but is ultimately sweet and has some fun parts.

The animation is probably a ~4/10, but some of the designs are really great!","7 August 2022",7,2,3
"The Sea Beast","I loved it, I can see it over and over again. Brilliant movie. Highly recommend it. I wish the ending would have different with more details, but over all it is a great movie.","17 July 2022",10,3,8
"The Sea Beast","Cons: The plot is almost perfectly copied from How To Train Your Dragon. As I have watched How To Train Your Dragon this movie became insanely predictable.

Pros: Everything else.

The voice acting was superb. Everyone was incredible. There were a great chemistry between all of them, especially between Karl Urban and Jared Harris and between Karl Urban and Zaris-Angel Hator. They all truly carried this movie.

The animation was flawless, the art style was great.

I guess the only thing this movie didn't nail was the music as I cannot recall any epic music similar to How To Train Your Dragon's ""Flying Theme"".","11 July 2022",7,3,9
"The Sea Beast","Pro:
References to Sea TraditionsEntrateins Both Kids And AdultsMajestic IncipitExcellent CoreographyPerfect Sound EffectsPretty Good AnimationGrand Comedy MomentsPositive MessageFlawless Actors

Cons:
Not Good Enough Face Animation (especially the minor characters)A (very) Few Subdued MomentsStill A Movie For The Smallest.","15 July 2022",8,2,4
"The Sea Beast","One of the best things that really stands out in this movie is that it really feels less cartoonish and more realistic in terms of the dialogues and the characters' mannerisms.

I wouldn't say this one is a comedy because it is an action adventure movie which has funny bits along the way. That's why i really enjoy it. The jokes were not forced and feels natural to the story. Also, the music is wonderful.

Dont get me started on the animation and action sequences, IT IS PEAK.","12 July 2022",10,3,9
"The Sea Beast","The Sea Beast is nothing special, it has a simple but fun storyline, good animation and good voice actors. The movie is about a young girl who wants to become a hunter (Hunt's Sea Monsters), but ends up discovering that they're not dangerous or out to murder humans and are instead just defending themselves against the humans who want to kill them. By the end she convinces everyone else of the same and monsters and humans live together in peace and happiness.

Sound familiar at all? Well it does to me as well... The name ""How To Train Your Dragon"" come to mind? It does to mine anyway. The story to me feels copy pasted from there, but anyway I still enjoyed it and it's a fun movie to watch. So enjoy it for what it is.

A 7/10 from me, Love Karl Urban as Jacob btw.","18 November 2022",7,0,0
"The Sea Beast","I hadn't been expecting much from this going by the poster and title, but I was quite pleasantly surprised. A great metaphor of the US-led order, news media, and narratives.","17 August 2022",10,2,4
"The Sea Beast","I really dont care how the so called war started. Calling hunting beasts a war stretches the definition so far the word ceases to have meaning.

What I want to know is who pays for all this ""war"". The hunters aren't doing it for free. They need ships, supplies, wages, repairs... who pays for it? Does the king and queen take the money from taxes to cover these costs? Are the tax payers paying to have monsters sent to the bottom of the ocean with nothing to show for it but stories told by sailors.

They are clearly a low technology nation. Black powder guns and swords. Not the kind of situation where they can spare mothers for duties as soldiers, hunters and other such pursuits. They need to make the next generation of taxpayers to pay for monster killing.","5 October 2022",1,0,6
"The Sea Beast","The Sea Beast is a great adventure with some pretty cool animation. I love the looks of the beasts. And who doesn't love Karl Urban's voice? I think he was a great choice, and he really should be included in more things. This film is a lovable How to Train Your Dragon-type movie. I just love the style and feel of the movie. And while the story is a good one, I don't think it's really grand or groundbreaking, which is my only small problem with it. Definitely something to put on for family movie night.","31 July 2022",8,0,3
"The Sea Beast","Like many have said before, this is quite similar to HTTYD,but worse. Don't get me wrong it's still a quite the enjoyable movie

What i liked about the movie is of course the amazing animation. The water is so real,the character along with their animations is just as good. Everything looks amazing,clean and very smooth.

Another thing that i liked quite a bit is that the movie took itself somewhat seriouslly. The fights between the monsters were never really interrupted by any funny or goofy moments. Something that would take you out of the moment. So i appreciate that part quite a bit,

Things that could've been better are:
The characters were okay,there were only a few of those and they are not as memorable but they do their job.

The music could've been better,again it's not bad but there's nothing that sticks out to you or even that memorable. Could've added a couple pirate songs here and there.

The sea beasts could've been better too,i felt like they didn't not explore them much. You don't even see that much of them,they fell bit flat for me with a few exceptions here and there. Like the small blue jellyfish thingie that was super cute. The main beast literally has the head of toothless from HTTYD (yes i even compared them in between pics). That's not necessarily a bad thing. Both can be cute and terryfing,but yeah could've came up with something original. Altho i understand they wanted to make it more expressive.

The story can be predictable yes,it's not all that surprisng. There's a couple of more touching moments here and there which were able to made me teary for a few seconds. But it wasn't able to struck me as deep as HTTYD.

All in all this is a decent movie,it has it's moments. It has heart put into it. It has pretty good action pieses and i'd recomend it to anyone who enjoyed HTTYD. Or just in general a good and fun animated movie.","18 August 2022",7,1,1
"The Sea Beast","Visually impressive.

The accents make it feel like I'm watching a school play. Why they insist on having non-locals attempt a London accent... And why they need that accent at all? Jack Sparrow did a great job, these guys just feels like overkil. They're inconsistent, all over the place and don't match the character. Still enjoyed it like.","14 July 2022",7,2,5
"The Sea Beast","People hunt monsters. Monsters fight back. One young person realises the monsters aren't so bad. Befriends one of the monsters. Etc. Etc.

Sound familiar?

The lack of originality isn't the biggest problem, though. More of an issue is the fact The Sea Beast is overly long and bloated. There are some good moments, but by the credits rolled, I was glad it was over.","25 August 2022",5,1,3
"The Sea Beast","Sensacional ! This is not an film for kids or adults! Its an political and human lesson! The back history is clear. The Sea Beast referis to comunists Red) and the hunters refers to EUA and others imperialists europians countries. And there is a ever since war that the ocident countries makes the hole world believe the comunists are the evil, but this iis not the true . Its an lie ever since told for the world that must be stopped and this is the unique way to reach the world peace someday.

This film is modern , profound and must be seen many times to get all the beautiful message of this great masterpiece . Stop all the stupid war and hate in this world please.","9 July 2022",10,13,36
"The Sea Beast","The animation was nothing new. All but the main red monster, was really interesting. Don't know why the main thing was a red whale with no discernable features other than being red and featureless. Seems more suited to the theatre. Maise should have been a young woman as her character is waaay too mature in her understanding and attitudes. It almost looks like there's gonna be a romance between the two leads. The plot was nothing original but was not bad either. All in all, its a decent film. The animations of the beasts and the sound design were greatly suited for huge monster movies.","5 August 2022",6,0,1
"The Sea Beast","Very surprised by this movie. Wonderful, uplifting film. Did you know how it would end? Sure. But the journey was fun. And the animation was some of the best I've ever seen. If you have a 4K setup, it is a visual treat to watch this film. Looked absolutely superb on my OLED. Highly recommended.","23 July 2022",10,2,9
"The Sea Beast","I liked the movie.

I agree with many people on here and I did not read all the reviews.

This movie is about the Native Americans/First people/RED people. They were perceived as, or acted badly because, that is how they were treated by all, even those fighting each other and those of various other ethnicities. The Native Americans were mistreated by everybody and we just need to be caring to then and there is no fight in them, can't we all just get along?","2 August 2022",10,2,3
"The Sea Beast","This animation was excellent , storyline was excellent , tone and timbre excellent and the morals it teaches are time honoured . This is the second Netflix animated film I've watched with my grandkids . Keep them coming , no more need for Disney's nonsense .","11 July 2022",9,4,7
"The Sea Beast","Very beautiful movie. Appealing for both kids and for grown ups. The landscapes were amazing, the animation was one of the best that was ever created. The story is very refreshing and relaxing to watch. The dialogues are just perfect.

There are action scenes, emotional scenes, cute scenes, funny scenes.

Awesome soundtrack also.

It has something to learn for the kids too, but is also packed with enough action to keep grown ups hooked.

I honestly think this movie will remain a super great one in time, and it may also rival with other classics like ""Frozen"" or "" How to train your dragon"".

Will definitely rewatch.","28 September 2022",10,1,2
"The Sea Beast","Though the visuals are as times bsolutely stunning, I thought the movie as a whole was utterly disappointing given its current (7.1) rating.

I've read some reviews here and found it very odd that both the bad and the negative reviews focus so much on racial diversity, yet not enough on the movie itself.

The voice acting wasn't on the level you'd expect given the cast and the story was incredibly generic-which can be fine, but then the rest has to blow you away.

Next to that, the two main characters had a very odd relationship; oftentimes it felt more in the brink of a starting romantic relationship than a father and daughter relationship. Their bikkering almost feels like flirting and I truly believe that if you'd had put two characters of similar age in this film, without changing anything, it would've been more believable as a story

The little girl was also utterly annoying, she had no flaws in her character at all and the wisdom of a 50 year old at the age of, like, 11. Schooling adults who have more life experience left, right and centre, and easily drawing conclusions that adults seem to not understand or be capable of drawing... It makes her character just not likeable and believable from the very first moment. There's nothing innocent, playful or childish about her character; which (even for an orphan) just doesn't seem logical or right.

It's alright to watch as a movie though; you won't feel it totally wasted your time. But that's about as good as it gets.","16 July 2022",5,2,9
"The Sea Beast","The story falls with the same template as how to train your dragon, but it's not interesting to see the animation movie. Fails miserably with the animation and as well in the story narration. May work for the kids, but as a movie it didn't bring any attention to watch it continuously.","5 August 2022",3,0,4
"The Sea Beast","One thing that made me fall in love with this movie is the Story. Writers were very clear in what they're writing. They've built each and every character with intense care. The director has brought the Story to life and VFX team did an amazing job in bringing the characters to life. The movie was a fun ride and I loved every minute of it. It's very rare we see Netflix making these kind of movies and I want to see more coming from them.

Finally, the ending of the movie left me in tears. It's great to see how a character changes from being tough to ease and it all happens because of a small kid.","9 August 2022",9,1,2
"The Sea Beast","I really liked how the movie showed the relationship between beasts and people. It is very familiar to How to train your dragon but I didn't even notice it.","6 August 2022",9,1,2
"The Sea Beast","Good old fashioned fun and fab animation. Yes at 2 hours it's long, but don't miss this film, it's worth every minute.

The character development is really good making you care about each character. It even has a moral.

But the length means it won't suit younger viewers which is a shame. I know I would have loved this story as a kid. There sint any Disney schmaltz here just great characters.

I am a huge fan of animation and this doesn't disappoint with amazing attention to detail. This must have taken a huge amount of time to animate. Every hair is animated realistically, I can't help feeling that some motion capture must have gone on here to get realistic character gestures and movements.","18 October 2022",10,1,2
"The Sea Beast","It's just a stitching monster! Nothing new, as for art, it can really be said to have no aesthetic sense. As the protagonist of the red sea beast, there is no complicated design of purple crabs, and individual comments are too embarrassed to blow a wave of ""top-level fine art pictures""? The plot is also very jumpy, basically a 20-minute episode, and many myths have not been answered in the end.","22 July 2022",5,2,8
"The Sea Beast","I like that this movie encourages children to question things and not just believe what they are told or read, especially in this day and age!

Also good range of 'people' in the movie, genders and races doing all jobs.","9 July 2022",8,3,5
"The Sea Beast","It's been a long time since I've seen such a beautiful animated film, visually it's magnificent, the music too, the adventurous atmosphere, the extravagant city and the boat reminds me of Sinbad (a childhood favourite of mine) the cast is great their voices brings more depth to the characters in addition to well written dialogues

The story is very beautiful, classic but necessary lessons : Having a critical mind, knowing the real History even when it's not pretty, taking time to understand one another, learn from it to change things and that it will makes us more open and happy people

Little note : I love the beautiful hairstyles of Maisie and Sarah, it's still so rare in the film industry, it makes me happy
(sorry for the english it's not my mother tongue)","17 July 2022",9,2,5
"The Sea Beast","This file, I can highly recommend.

It's also reminiscent of other movies from my childhood with pirate kids movies. Like Sinbad (2003)
treasure planet
(2002).

The sea beast only has better graphics. Besides a great family movie.","13 July 2022",9,2,3
"The Sea Beast","Kinda depressing that such a great team had to make another basic environmentalist story a la ""train your dragon"". Very predictable. There was a time when kids learned to hunt, to TRUELY know nature. Now we see people try to have picknicks next to lions. Everyday i hope for a story to correct it al. To kill moby dick and harvest his amber instead of open thy cheeks for the big white one.

I do like that it has cursing, weapons, alcohol and no p*ssy editing. There's still hope. One day i hope we'll realize the ""holy indian"" is a lie and we'll return to a time where we can feed the lions in the zoo again without warning signs.

Still, entertaining enough, def succeeded as a kids movie. Art is neat too. Lovely animation. Voice acting is perfect.","13 July 2022",7,0,1
"The Sea Beast","It has a profound meaning in its story that we were taught to hate for the benefit of certain people. We should end all the wars in the world and stop supporting governments that create these terrible events for the sake of the few. Great work!","13 July 2022",10,3,8
"The Sea Beast","This film tries very hard to create the correct ""modern"" eighteenth century world filled with equality and sea faring adventures for all, and it just feels like it tries too hard and steps over the line of disbelief too many times.

The look of the film's world is at times very realistic to the whaling days of yore, yet the ships crew is a combination of men and women which jars with any who have seen films such as ""Master and Commander"", ""In the Heart of the Sea"" or ""Moby Dick"" in many of its iterations. But, hey, this is a new world for all kids who like animation, not our old one for boys from the previous century, so put aside your history and just go with it. Which I tried to do, but when the little orphan girl starts to dominate and lead the story, achieving things or understanding things without any justifiable reason, such as the red beast's true motivation and befriending it for no reason given on the red beasts part, my suspension of disbelief burst and I sank to the bottom of ocean in boredom.

There is action and danger, great sea battles, great design (although the red beast felt too simplistic compared to other elements in the film) and a rousing music score, just not enough humour, and too much convenience with the little too cute blue monster pet/friend of the little girl. The end confrontation scene was just too unrealistic for a world based on a monarchical society.","6 January 2023",6,0,0
"The Sea Beast","From animation to storytelling to the sheer graphic effects... this movie is a gem. Absolute stellar animation this is coming from a huge fan of Pixar and DreamWorks. The plot is nice for a kid to follow and has enough suspense to keep the adults watching, giving a lot of moral lessons about the truths of life. But were this movie really shines for me is the clarity in which it portrays the fact that everyone has a totally different reality, backed by the experiences and predispositions of the person. Everyone thinks is in the right and everyone has a different truth. Very good lesson for a children and adults alike. Really eye opening and joyful film!

Thank you everyone that made this gem come to life!","14 July 2022",10,3,8
"The Sea Beast","You will recognize everything in this movie, from predictable and tired clichés to plotlines you've seen in better movies.

And of course, hamfisted preaching.

But I guess this movie this isn't for me as an adult.

What I did really enjoy were some of the shots and scenes that were impressive and inventive. The cinematography in the battle scenes is fun, but it's also a movie where nobody is allowed to die even if the whole premise of the movie is a war between humans and the sea beasts.

But from the get-go you will know exactly what this movie is about and how it's going to play out. That's because you've seen this movie before, because this is How to Train Your Dragon, but wet. That's not even an exaggeration either it really is the same movie, just not as good. And if I can be a bit nitpicky, what kind of name for a movie is The Sea Beast?

The faux Bri'ish accents will drive you up the wall too. You'd think that if they wanted a diverse cast they'd let people have more than one accent but that's not the case.

And what's with the kid being more of an adult than the adults? Except when she isn't, of course, for the sake of comedy.","18 January 2023",3,0,0
"The Sea Beast","After a long time I watched a good animated movie. Everyone can watch this film it's not only for kids.

I don't know why iMDB Rating is not good I give this 8/10.","8 July 2022",8,3,7
"The Sea Beast","Love the pirate aesthetic but at its core this is very similar to how to train your dragon. Even the red sea beast resembles toothless. Besides that, animation is great and there are some funny scenes on the island.","15 July 2022",5,2,6
"The Sea Beast","Y'all are ridiculous. It was a great movie and will keep you entertained the whole time. ""ItS toO SimiLaR to HTTYD."" Who cares, it's fun with a plot that's pretty similar to HTTYD but that's not always a bad thing. It's a kids movie. It was an enjoyable movie from start to finish. Your kid will love this movie, please check it out. It has everything you want out of a kids movie and more including a good lesson. Y'all always gotta find a way to complain.","17 July 2022",9,4,9
"The Sea Beast","One of my favorite movies

its really great, fantastic tale and adventure, great graphics, amazing sound-score, and really amazing story

10/10 from here

this movie just gave Disney a kick to the...","15 August 2022",10,2,3
"The Sea Beast","It's an above average Netflix movie. You have a generic adventure story with vibrant colors and a ""lesson"". The one thing that did surprise me however was the animation. Holy smokes, the animation is good. But, that's it. It's a normal kids movie with Pixar-level animation, what else can I say?","14 August 2022",6,0,1
"The Sea Beast","Just watched this and Ive never reviewed a film ever on imdb. We all thought it was a great film. Unexpected too which is even more of a surprise then. We also picked up on the quality of the graphics. They were absolutely amazing at some points and we were thinking about the detail while watching it. Fabulous. In parts for some reason it remined me of Game of Thrones or something like that as it was quite dramatic and tense in parts. Really enjoyed. My eight year old boy also enjoyed. Disney take note I would say...escapism is what we need not agendas!","9 July 2022",8,2,3
"The Sea Beast","Whoever gave rating less than 8, they hate Netflix and they don't appreciate good stuff. I don't think they even say thank you when they get help from someone. Don't be like them enjoy the movie and time. You can thank me later.","14 July 2022",10,2,4
"The Sea Beast","I was really amazed by the shots of this movie. Visually it is really a masterpiece, capturing the beautiful but frightening depths of the sea and vastness of beasts therein. But the story seemed pretty forced. The dull and flat ending is not even the worst in my eyes. I suffered most from the conversations. There seemed to have been totally random changes of mood and tone in the conversations and basically all of the lines from the girl just seemed so artificial and fabricated. I did not enjoy any of it. So it would watch the movie a second time mute or in a language I don't understand, that way I can spare myself the pathetic screenwriting and enjoy the great images.","17 August 2022",5,1,2
"The Sea Beast","A nice, light movie. If you want to ligten your mood a little and have an enjoyable time, you should definitely watch this. The humour in it is very addressed and it also has a valuable lesson. You will find yourself at peace once you finish it.","25 August 2022",6,0,1
"The Sea Beast","This will go down as one of my favourite
Animated films. Visually it is a beautiful looking film, the lighting and scenes throughout set up the feeling of actually being there, there was a moment I forgot I was watching an animated film. It drew me in that much. Stunning animation and action scenes. It seems more aimed at a slightly older audience, but still suitable for kids. This won't disappoint 🤘🏼","17 July 2022",10,2,6
"The Sea Beast","At first, I was afraid it was going to be a How To Train Your Dragon but at sea. I mean the sea monster even looked like Toothless. But I was pleasantly surprised. It is definitely worth the watch. Though there may some similarities between the two movies, it deviates just enough to make it a wonderful tale.","17 July 2022",8,2,4
"The Sea Beast","It's a cute animated film. Characters are likable enough, I enjoy the animation and action scenes. Blue is super cute and Karl Urban has a great voice. However, not something I'd be looking to watch again.","10 August 2022",6,0,2
"The Sea Beast","What graphics are these, my jaw dropped so far, there were scenes that I thought were showing real landscapes, this was too flawless. It's a shame it's only on Netflix, seeing this movie in theaters must be amazing.

Impossible not to remember 'How to Train Your Dragon' meets 'moana' and 'the pirates of the caribbean', but even so, the result is excellent and delivers a fun animation and visually it's a spectacle.

It has scenarios that seem to be real and the effects are exciting, in addition to having good characters.

That kind of recycling that, when done right, continues to work.","16 July 2022",7,0,3
"The Sea Beast","Gorgeous colors, animation, sequence shots, the film leaves you in awe. There are similarities with the Httyd franchise (cuteness overload ahead!), but seriously the world needs more child-beast heart-warming companionship !! 😊 I loved it! I wish for more movies to come, for the story arc/lore to flourish.","17 July 2022",8,2,4
"The Sea Beast","This film overall can be considered, in my eyes, to be (mostly) a retelling of How To Train Your Dragon, except with less emphasis on character development and more so on plot. That said, it definitely has its own identity and deserves to be considered its own story with its own unique personality. This film contains some serious messages about taking myths at face value, blind loyalty and redemption, and wraps them in a lighthearted yet frequently touching story, full of great action and decent comedy. The choice of a flat arc protagonist in the form of a child was classic and the variety of accents used for the characters was well done and refreshing.

The film has a comfortable length and moves at a relatively brisk pace, perhaps a tad too brisk but not much. The visuals are about as good as any animation I've seen and my jaw hit the ground multiple times during this film.

Overall this film knows what it wants to be, does its job well and manages to wow you with its visuals throughout. There's a lot more to talk about with Sea Beast but it's definitely worth a watch and is a film all ages will appreciate, particularly the kids.","10 July 2022",8,1,4
"The Sea Beast","Yeah so i just put this on for background noise while i draw and its actually so good?? Ive always been a sucker for the httyd franchise and this movie is similar to the first httyd (albeit way darker)
the beginning kinda drags but its super important later on and has pretty visualsthe characters are amazing and i love them but are objectively popular archetypesthe designs of the monsters are great, especially the red bluster (the beast on the poster) and that little blue bulldog fish that i forgot the name ofthe plot, albeit basic, is very fun and the script makes up for it

yeah overall 9/10 very good but not the best.","14 July 2022",9,3,7
"The Sea Beast","While I think this movie will be good for small kids, as an adult I found the plot very flat, the dialogue simple and the voice acting quite poor, with a particular focus on the little girl protagonist.

The storyline is droll and predictable with no nuance or complexity. There progressive narrative is obvious with the white man being ""bad"" and requiring great improvement while others are less complex and more innately good. Suffice to say I felt the political ideology was more important to display than a good plot and storyline which is predictable, particularly for Netflix.

Still, good for kids who can't see or articulate these issues.","10 July 2022",6,6,19
"The Sea Beast","The story from the problem to the plot to the solution is wonderful. The beginning of the film was not encouraging and the characters were far from reality, but it was a need to attract the largest segment of the audience, but the solution to the problem of the story was very impressive.","9 July 2022",10,3,12
"The Sea Beast","There's enough reviews for you to see the meat and bone of the story, I'm just going to clear the air some.

Every witch rides A broom, I didn't see anyone calling Harry Potter a copy.

This movie had a much richer story than a certain dragon movie will ever have.

If you're an adult looking to watch this movie with your kid, this one actually can be something for you and your kid to watch while enjoying your popcorn, plus it doesn't cost your dignity after the movie ends.

But you might end up with the problem of this movie becoming one of your kids favorite and have to watch it every night with them.

Graphic wise, it's beautiful and decent enough for me to choose this anytime over any sugarcoated crap that Disney puts out these days.

And for the music, voice-overs and audio effects this movie is brilliant both in English dub and French.

Overall, I was satisfied with this movie. On top of that, you might ACTUALLY LEARN something from this movie. (Yes, even as an adult. And no, it doesn't lead you to talk about the birds and the bees.)","12 July 2022",10,2,5
"The Sea Beast","Now this movie is an example of when Netflix delivers😌I am happy to report not only myself but my kids, ages 13&15, thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Definitely for audiences of all ages. You will be captivated from start to finish. Keep a eye and ear out for some references or likeness of other characters😉","18 July 2022",10,3,9
"The Sea Beast","The Sea Beast is a maze of emotions, colours and wonderful story telling set against a backdrop of fearsome monsters and rough seas.

This is a delightful flick that will appeal to all ages with the main cast (Maise and Jacob) playing out a growing father and daughter bond beautifully.

The story keeps moving and engages the viewer to invest their time as misconceptions are dismantled and bonds emerge. The screenplay is tight as well as the dialogue which is witty and original. The action keep you pretty much glued and the supporting characters are a perfect fit within the framework of the movie.

This is a must watch for any movie fan - the superb visuals show that not every glorious animation comes out of the House Of Pixar.

Absolutely fantastic.","20 July 2022",9,3,7
"The Sea Beast","You can tell that the director had some serious vision about the pirate world and wanted to make it come to sight as much as possible(offcourse bloodshed cannot be shown in these films). The film has a steady pace and keeps bringing in one or other parts. The sea beast(especailly Red) definitely reminds of 'How to Train your dragon' because the heart of it is similar but theres more with political point that is shown and such small improvements are always fun to look at. Every Disney and DreamWorks animated film lover will for sure love this film and it deserves that. A Wonderful Watch and it also has some nice lines.","25 September 2022",9,0,1
"The Sea Beast","Good movie with a great lesson, the plot and the story flow is captivating, though it is not very out of the box and many scenes are very predictable but still the story catches the behold the spectator till last.","16 July 2022",8,2,4
"The Sea Beast","It's funny how Pixar has become the standard by which we rate things...

This film was fantastic! Excellent story, animation, and characters. I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was full of heart and humour.

It's definitely one of the better children's films Netflix has done of late.

Kids will love it!","24 August 2022",7,0,1
"The Sea Beast","I really liked the first minutes where we get to know the characters on board of the Inevitable. The dynamic between those characters is really heartwarming and the idea of pirates fighting sea monster hooked me up.

Especially the relationship between captain Crow and his adopted son was well represented and acted. The vibe of the movie was like you would expect from a pirate movie with rough but warming characters even though it is animated.

I thought this movie would go the route of showing the competition between the old and the new ways with the moral beeing that the old ways can still be worth following, maybe with a bit of renewal by the captain's son.

Sadly I got disappointed after the first 20 minutes because the movie shifts to a more family friendly tone with cuddly sea creatures and becomes ""how to taim your dragon"". It's basically the same story in a different setting.

One could compare it in that sense to ""Up"" where the first 15 minutes where genuine to watch but afterwards it got way to kid friendly with speaking dogs..

Still I feel positive towards the characters which are all rather charming, so if you cannot get enough of the formula of ""how to taim your dragon"" I don't think there is a need to skip this one.","27 July 2022",5,2,5
"The Sea Beast","The hunters reminded me the privateers in the 15th and 16th centuries that played a great role on many expeditions and colonialism. Their way of following the rules of hunters, seems parallel to ""code of conduct"" between them. They were state-funded by island and played a vital role against Spanish domination at the time. Until the Royal Navy got main control on the area, they worked with similar interests. The beasts can be an iconic figure, Newfoundland, Spanish Indies areas or any other trouble at the time. Some privateers were national heroes where they were on bounty for other nations. When the time comes governments choses to leave them and even fight against them. In the essay of ""The Golden Age of Piracy and the British Contribution to its Development"" Dr. Martin Mares mentions many relations. Of course all these historic inferences are made by me(not an academic review). History, and the good and bad inside of this history are written by powerful governments that may direct people's attitude about a fact. And one pure-minded kid, with enough bravery in her heart can question that written history. I watched this movie with my two daughters and it has great lessons and perspectives inside. Definitely a good context. A good motivation to question anything that taught us.","9 July 2022",9,3,12
"The Sea Beast","I didn't like the story but Animation was average..

I didn't find it great..

First half was great..😶 some of the colour was fantastic and some wasn't great..","16 July 2022",5,0,8
"The Sea Beast","I had not heard about this at all before watching. I was not expecting much and I was blown away by how fun it was! Sailors, monsters, and good action! If you suspend your disbelief just a little you'll enjoy it from start to finish!","16 July 2022",10,3,7
"The Sea Beast","Entertainment for 3 year olds to geezers!

First class animation, color, music, voices, script.

Wondering where it way made and what else they have produced.","2 August 2022",10,2,4
"The Sea Beast","It might be a children story however it's a amazing story and lots of lesson learn. It's like telling you, Don't believe all that you had read and always see the truth with your own eyes as well be open about it. What you see can be wrong too but learn about it.

A very brave story between young girl and how adapting the young man is. Very good.

The graphic and animation is smooth and love the storyline. Wish they were part 2 though about how the war between man and beast started...","9 July 2022",10,5,14
"The Sea Beast","It speaks for the reality of our world. Perfect movie. It touched my heart. Red is the image of our world, destroyed by people and run by kinhs and queens that only look for profit. We are destroying our planet, day by day.","17 July 2022",10,3,8
"The Sea Beast","It's been a long time since I've enjoyed a cartoon movie like that. It's for the whole family. Ended too soon, hoping for sequel!!! Juse Wow! The visuals are amazing, the storyline is so refreshing and good written. I'm so happy Netflix showed this to me.","16 July 2022",10,3,7
"The Sea Beast","I've seen reviews that have compared this to How To Train Your Dragon, and while it is similar in the fact that the 'monsters' aren't actually monsters, the overall film is just as amazing to me. For someone who watched and loved all of the HTTYD films and loved them, I truly found myself enjoying every moment. The animation, the details, the voices, the score, it was all well done.","11 July 2022",10,2,5
"The Sea Beast","A good-natured and enjoyable, if less impactful, light re-skinning of the HTTYD story, with pirates, vibrant colours and a range of accents between Talk Like A Pirate Day, Dick Van Dyke and Oliver Twist.","25 July 2022",7,2,4
"The Sea Beast","What a wonderful film!!

The animation is STUNNING, with such an eye for detail, you can every see wrinkles on the clothing.

The story is endearing, and leaves you feeling happy.","10 July 2022",10,3,10
"The Sea Beast","It's no Moana, Big Hero 6 or Encanto but it's cute. As a non Disney or Pixar backed animation film it's still a good watch. Age appropriate with a good level of reflection for those who are older enough to catch it. No annoying songs so parents rest easy. There are ""monsters"" so gage your childs fear level with the trailer. The black lead is written in an organic manner not pandering. Love the natural hair of course.","25 July 2022",8,2,5
"The Sea Beast","Chris Williams has created a world rich in texture and evocative of all things middle ages, Kingdom, and British of old. I hear the comparisons to other stories but it stands on its own as being delightfully written with the seamlessness of storytellers whose lives were committed to the craft beyond the 10,000 hours. Although some of the dialogue may not have had the best selection of words, the heart in the work and the detail-rich telling spoke to me in quite a similar way to the experience of watching ""The Iron Giant"".

It merits a viewing or two. It doesn't have radical twists but some of the tempered writing, the gritty voice acting, and full detail made this an enjoyable experience which had me reeled in from the beginning to the end.","3 January 2023",8,0,0
"The Sea Beast","Animations nowadays boring with mostly same story, but Sea Beast skewed that into different story, whole picture at sea to hunt giant beast who lived on water and island. Maise sparkling the children character who bravely came into the hunting ship. Unexpectedly, beast play with little Maise helps them to find their ship.

Compare with recent animations this is totally splendid! Boring with super-hero movies, good ending also. Colors throughout the movie is colorful to eyes which kid loving too much. Time length is quite high, but it does not have a major impact, story is flowing chronologically.","13 October 2022",10,1,2
"The Sea Beast","A unique and powerful story that tackles politically relevant topics without feeling like an extended sermon. And I'm just going to say it - fantasy has a long history of sucking at diversity. That's gotten better in recent years, but usually in a clunky, heavy-handed manner. Most characters here are a mixed bag of humanity, which gives this swash-buckling monster-hunting adventure a thoughtfully diverse (in all meanings of the word) cast of characters.","25 July 2022",8,3,9
"The Sea Beast","Extremely thin story full of Disney junk (including good and extremely poorly designed characters) and an annoying all-knowing girl who should appear sympathetic, but that plays outside of reality. High quality animations, only the monsters seem pasted in. What a waste it could have been a good movie.","31 July 2022",1,3,10
"The Sea Beast","A little lass named, maisie, no matter she is young and energetic but ready to challenge every obstacle whatever comes in her way. Words are more powerful than bullets so she uses her kind words to seduce an enormous monster to stop the fight which was going on for many years. She teaches to the people of the land that you can be hero by not killing monsters. It's not compulsory that only killing monsters can make you a hero. The fight will never stop if we will not stop by ourselves. In the end, people of the town agree with her words and stop king and queen from killing Red Bulster. She also comes to know from books how to control sea beast and win their hearts which she does finally.

A little girl with big mind teaches to the people of town that killing all the time is not actually worthwhile sometimes without killing we can win their hearts and can become heroes.","15 November 2022",10,0,1
"The Sea Beast","I've never seen a film with such an equal balance of gender and race and disability. The king and queen's guards are women and men, the random villager is a woman, the random cart driver is a woman. I can't think of any other kids film where there's actually a 50/50 split if you consider all non speaking characters.

Much better moral the how to train your dragon too. The point is there's no such thing as good and evil. The quote repeated in the film that ""you can have been a hero but have been wrong"" is the point. It's not ""beasts are actually good and kind"", they're not, they kill the same way the hunters kill. The point is that fighting because you think the other side is bad is wrong. In how To train your dragon they team up against another evil, the point in this film is that there's no such thing as the good/ bad guys.

Really great character animation and voice acting. I could watch this again and again, and that's saying something for most children's films.","18 November 2022",10,0,2
"The Sea Beast","So my family and I gave this a try and we were pleasantly surprised. First off let me just say I'm not a Netflix fan. And I don't like the wokeness of the new Disney ether. We found none of these problems in this film. It was just characters that were portraying people and not an agenda. It reminds me of the old Disney where you got an entertaining story and possibly a great moral lesson. The voice acting was phenomenal. The animation was excellent. And the story was 10 out of 10. You even got a slight nod to the classic Moby-Dick if you pay attention to the dialogue. Honestly can't believe I'm saying this. But thank you for this one Netflix. Please make more like it.","8 August 2022",10,1,2
"The Sea Beast","I love the storyline especially the graphics and visual, makes me wow, it is ethereal, yess kinda predictable but the characters are great.

Don't fight me but kinda don't like how Maisie being to assertive in things in some scenes I found it annoying and how she deliver lines that kind of insensitive and so much pride, and somewhat might hurt others feelings especially Jacob. Don't get me wrong, she have the right to speak in some circumstances only like I want to shut her mouth like she thinks she knows everything.

Yet highly recommend!","27 July 2022",8,0,4
"The Sea Beast","""In a world very similar to ours, huge sea monsters rule the seas, terrifying men. But fortunately, there are heroes who live in the sea to protect their people from such creatures, the brave hunters of monsters"". It is the incipit of the latest Netflix original animated film directed by Oscar winner Chris Williams, a director already known and loved for films such as Oceania, Big Hero 6, and Bolt: a four-legged hero. The Monster of the Seas made its official debut on Netflix last July 8, reaching the high position of the Top 10 of the most watched on the platform in a few days.

While enjoying the director's Disney training, Monster of the Seas is a film as simple as it is moving which, with a more adult approach, intends to bring a fairytale story to the small screen where the struggle between men and monsters immediately launches the audience into the predictable doubt: Who is the real monster between sea creatures and human beings? Despite the excellent directorial and plot premises, The Sea Monster fails to excel or hit the spectator's heart, and this is due to the hasty pace, the poor development of the characters, and the lack of originality of the happy ending.","20 January 2023",6,0,0
"The Sea Beast","The movie was over all very good, but I find a lot of things that are similar to HTTYD.

I loved this movie, dragon overs this is a must watch.

Such movies can teach many of us the real meaning of humanity.","17 July 2022",7,0,3
"The Sea Beast","When I started watching this movie a few days ago I had literally zero expectations. Just wanted to see an animation movie, because that kind movies are mostly relaxing and easy going. My eyes then were stuck to the screen from the first second on! Everything in ,,Sea Beast'' was absolutely wonderful! The animations are perfect and sometimes I could not even belief my eyes how beautiful everything in here looks. The Story for sure is flat but still interesting and fun. The characters are all lovely written and the acting is great! Only when it comes to Captain Crows Character i missed depth in his story and his motives. ,,Sea Beast's' is truly an adventure for all ages of crowd and delivers a strong and important message aswell. In total it's a underrated and mostly unknown masterpiece. So go watch this!","24 November 2022",10,0,1
"The Sea Beast","I'm a grown man with no kids and yep, i watched the whole film. It's surprisingly good and it's not what you might expect from the title/cover. It's a layered story that isn't afraid address complex problems related to tradition, honour, societal expectations and class structures without being preachy or oversimplified. Some of the subtlety around how these ideas are places in the narrative are really nice. The third act avoids being drawn out like a Marvel film, but could be a little long for younger kids. It also looks great with a lot of background detail. This is probably one you can watch together with your kids on a rainy day.","7 January 2023",7,0,0
"The Sea Beast","For a kid's movie, the animations strike a perfect balance to maintain the family-friendly look while still being gorgeous and not obviously censored. The premise of the movie, especially in the beginning, is great! There's action, and a lot of worldbuilding (maybe too much, actually). It really gets you interested in what's going down with these monsters and the hunters hunting them. The consistency of the animation continues throughout, and is the saving grace of this film.

This story begins falling apart in the middle of the movie and on, where the dialogues between the characters starts becoming incredibly simplistic and unbelievable. The child character has unexplained superior wisdom over everyone else. However, the movie throws in some interesting story beats that really drive the stakes up, which held my attention.

All of it is for nothing, however, as in the ending it seems like the story was truncated and replaced with some random happy ending where everyone just moves on with their lives. All of the interesting story beats that were introduced beforehand are immediately nullified or go on completely unexplained, leaving you with absolutely no idea what the hell just happened. There are tragic events that are simply passed over without any closure, consequences that never come to fruition, and worst of all, even more unrealistic dialogue that doesn't even give a satisfying ending to the main plot. It is unceremonious. This, honestly, felt like a troll ending to an otherwise passing-grade plot.","14 August 2022",5,1,3
"The Sea Beast","Loved the natural implementation of diversity without making it a big issue of who's what and why. Just a simple movie with a strong message, great graphics, loved the voice actors, great for children and adults. Yes, it's reminiscent of HTTYD and Frozen, but still good within its own right.","18 July 2022",10,2,8
"The Sea Beast","The most well-animated Frankfurt school agitprop I have ever seen!

Every archetype is turned exactly on its head, and every line in the movie was one I've heard verbatim in other movies. This is the perfect movie for adults that judge a movie by its praxis and for children who judge by whether or not there is a market tested comic relief character- And there's both!

The most subtle social commentary since The Emoji Movie!","18 August 2022",3,0,1
"The Sea Beast","Criticizing the graphics:
Visually it's terrific, colors are great some scenes looks realistic but exactly it's the problem, art direction wise, things doesn't have a character.

Some objects and characters are so photo realistic, some are so cartoonish, some scenes everything looks serious and then the movie is goofy.

Don't know what is wrong! Even textures and objects materials varies in terms of style.

When it comes to story, I'd say it's too shallow and expected, most of the dialogue is very cleche and predictable.

Overall you can enjoy the movie, it's a family movie after all and it has some funny moments and some memorable scenes.","17 September 2022",7,0,1
"The Sea Beast","Watching this cartoon, I did not feel a return to my childhood, the cartoon is quite simple, among the pluses I can only identify certain childish moments and certain words that do not sound childish, which is quite unusual for such a cartoon and can depend on the rating. The minus that scared the monsters the most is their appearance, some of them look as if they were created in a few hours by an amateur, sometimes it is even scary to look at them, which ceases to be a children's cartoon and becomes a horror. The characters are interesting but not revealed, they act according to the script and you don't feel the soul and essence of what they do and their actions, it has to be done that way because it has to be done that way, not logically. I liked the sound, I think they worked hard on the sound, it conveys at least some atmosphere.

P. S. This is just my opinion.","30 August 2022",5,0,2
"The Sea Beast","*Please keep in mind this review and rating are coming from the perspective of ""this movie was made for children, not fully grown adults""*

The people who say it's like How to Train your Dragon are definitely right. And it doesn't take long to notice. There are some obvious holes in the story, that could've been wrapped up with an extra 10 minutes of movie broken up here or there. For me that's the most disappointing part. They also say ""a**"" and ""bloody hell"" one time each and not as a punchline (pretty much just because they're ""hunters"") so you may care about that for your kids.

But- it's an entertaining movie. It's lighthearted. You'll get some laughs. Its beautiful animation. Good dialogue. Not too long. And I personally liked it...

If you're looking for a movie that will keep you guessing- this is NOT the movie for that. It's very predictable- but it's a kids movie, how much suspense are we expecting from a kids movie???

To me it's a cute film, but it depends on what you prioritize in a movie. If originality is high on your list or suspense, or surprise.. you probably won't give it more than a five. But if animation and entertainment are your main priorities then I'd say it's closer to an 8 or maybe even a 9. Either way I think it's worth a try. Especially for kids (Which is who it's intended for)","17 September 2022",8,0,1
"The Sea Beast","The animation and characters were good but didn't enjoy it very much. The story was nothing new, too simple and predictable. If this was produced by pixar/disney, people would be really harsh on rating.","14 July 2022",5,0,6
"Turning Red","Turning Red features a predominantly East Asian cast and is about the growing pains that come for a young adolescent and her mother - oh, mothers and daughters, the things that come between them are about as (in this case) building busting as the love that invariably keeps them together - but it's an absolutely universal story. So many young people come to find that their parents, one and/or both depending on the time, become way too much to deal with, and that finding attraction in others is something immediate and pleasurable and also forms friendships (like 4-Town... ugh and they're 5 teens what gives). So many don't know what to do with their bodies as they sprout hair all over and hormones rage like a furnace. Is it possible to find your ""center"" when you're 13?

Turning Red is no different than, say, the 400 Blows in addressing how a young person finds themselves at a crossroads of life and choosing a way to go is a conundrum on top of a pain-pile some days, this despite/because of the joys that come with being young and (sometimes/discovering one likes to be) carefree and DGAF about stuff like school and routines and rituals. That these two films are from very different countries and times and protagonists isn't the point, rather that Domee Shii, like Truffaut or Greta Gerwig or Reiner/King with a Stand by Me or (insert other Coming of Age serio-comic saga), finds through her art some compelling ways to express how these changes are vast and cruel and bewildering.

In this case, Mei doesn't know what to quite do with her Panda-y self, or more significantly with what her mother wants her to do with it. It's a film ultimately about familial vs self expectations, and it's realized and executed with a heck of a lot of heart, wit, intense cuteness (that box of kittens made me laugh hard), and enough pathos to crash through a dozen concerts. I do have a few nitpicks on my first viewing, some maybe a little minor that I know come with suspending a bit of disbelief (there was never any time the parents thought to mention the whole Panda-transformation curse thing), and some maybe not as much (not to give too many spoilers away, but would 4-Town or their legions of fans react like *that* after what happens in the climax of the movie? I don't know if I fully buy it, even if it still makes for a heart-pulling finale). And on a more fundamental level, you can kind of see what's going to happen with the Mom pretty early on.

But these little points don't take away from this being another triumph for Pixar - I almost want to say yawn another but these things are so much harder to pull together and click all into place than most realize - and Shii fulfilling her promise after the dynamic High-Cute Big-Cry energy from Bao (which if you watch again, as I did, is thematically so similar to Red). I love the characters, the vision of Toronto, and so much to do with how we all as younger people struggled through the UGH and AAGH of so much, and it's a movie that manages to remind the adults how profound it can be to confront that and reflect on it all. If it falls short of All Time Masterpiece that may be more on me than it will be for you.","12 March 2022",9,368,657
"Turning Red","It's 2002 Toronto. Meilin is a 13 year-old Chinese-Canadian girl on the verge of adulthood. Her family cares for their temple honorable their ancestor who turned into a red panda to defend her family. One morning, she wakes up to find herself transformed into a red panda.

This is a coming-of-age story from Pixar. It's fun. I love the characters. There is a realism in these characters. They feel very authentic. Aside from the supernatural, this is really a story of a girl trying to find her way through puberty and dealing with her mother-daughter relationship. There are no big name actors other than Sandra Oh which does give this a feeling of non-Hollywood. The Toronto locations are also part of that. This has plenty of fun while dealing with some real tween issues.","13 March 2022",8,215,390
"Turning Red","This is the first Disney Pixar movie that I felt wasn't made for me whilst I was watching it. Their films usually have something for everyone and a very broad appeal.

I felt like this film was aimed squarely at young female TikTok users going through hormonal changes.

It has some very important messages that I'm glad to see getting some attention, but it was also very derivative and borrowed a lot of elements from a lot of other kids movies.","12 March 2022",5,372,746
"Turning Red","Red Pandas ... I know someone who loves them more than anything else. In this case the red panda stands for something more. The whole movie is about womanhood ... or rather a girl becoming a woman. That time in between actually.

I understand if this isn't everyones cup of tea. The movie is almost entirely aimed at girls. Having said that, you can enjoy this being something else entirely too. Because the characters are well written and funny. Are they over the top? I mean of course they are - the main character literally transforms when she has mood swings/changes ... how could this not be over the top and exaggerated? You just have to go with the flow.

Engaging and really fun, still has some issues with cliches if you care. But it also is one of the best animated movies of the year. You can call it woke, you can call it cringe ... but the target audience loves it. And that is just showing that the movie achieved what it set out to do. I don't think or believe I know what goes on or happens in puberty with young girls ... but this movie probably gets as close to it, while remaining entertaining and funny as it can be.","25 March 2022",10,65,121
"Turning Red","I can recognize myself in a lot of Mei's experiences and learned something new about them as well. There are not a lot of movies that normalize other significant parts about puberty like periods and understanding your parents, but this one does and they do it perfectly. Even for those watching who cannot relate to Mei's experience, it's a great watch to see where she and other girls may be coming from.","13 March 2022",8,61,113
"Turning Red","There's a reason this movie is a PG and not a U! Everyone having a little turn because a 13 year old girl is given some maxi pads and has crushes on boys - it's not woke, it's reality.

And if you have a problem with characters wearing turbans/hijabs, then I really think you need to look deep inside yourself!

This movie doesn't feel like a Disney/Pixar because it's cringey and has anime elements - but it's still fun, and my 10 and 8 year old boys had no problem at all with seeing sanitary protection because guess what, they see it in our bathroom every day!","11 March 2022",7,103,168
"Turning Red","This is not up to the usual high bar Pixar has set over the years. Characters were not endearing, it felt like they were trying too hard to be relatable and it just wasn't entertaining for a wide range of viewers. Very disappointing as most Pixar movies have universal themes & characters that reach all generations with positive messages and engaging plots.","15 March 2022",2,206,387
"Turning Red","Well, the animation is often creative and incorporates some anime elements to highlight the culture on display.

Let's see...what else positive can I say?... There is an attempt at strong characterization as Mei learns to be independent and learns the value of her independence. But it comes across as hollow because from the film's opening scene she says that she takes pride in being independent. So, there's no change in values for her. She just becomes more outspoken.

Also, I found the movie rather distasteful in that it seems to encourage rebelling against your parents because they'll never understand you, as opposed to appreciating what they do for you and having honest, open two-way communication with them.

Lastly, good gracious this is one of the most cringe-inducing films I've ever seen. The writing and dialogue often comes across as a horribly dated Disney channel movie from 2002. The movie is loud, anxious, and obnoxious for almost the entirety of its runtime.

This is Pixar's first true misstep since Cars 2. I guess they can do wrong.","13 March 2022",4,182,365
"Turning Red","First, if you're focused on ""wokeness"" in a cartoon, go watch reruns of Bonanza. You have too much time on your hands.

This film is beautifully made. Nice story. Lots of laughs. Keeps you watching because of how heartfelt the film truly is.

You won't regret it...","14 March 2022",9,53,92
"Turning Red","Talk about two of the most irritating characters Pixar has ever created. The overbearing mother Ming and her overly dramatic daughter Mei, made this film extremely difficult to watch. Both characters were beyond insufferable! Pixar is completely losing its touch! This is the 3rd film in a row they make, that I would not want to watch more than once.","15 March 2022",1,198,380
"Turning Red","I'm normally a huge fan of Pixar. There hasn't ever been one that I haven't enjoyed. The movie did not feel like Pixar, it felt like I was watching anime with CGI. The animation felt like a mix of Disney and cartoon network, and it lacked the magic that makes Pixar films special. There were a few spots that made me laugh and that I found endearing, but overall I wish I could have gotten my time back.","12 March 2022",2,199,350
"Turning Red","Interesting. I thought my 14 year old & her 13 yr old friend would have loved this movie. We waited for it to come out and they had a movie night. 3/4 of the way through they were bored and switched to the Nintendo switch. They said they didn't really ""get"" what the point of the story was and they lost interest. Head scratcher. I need to watch it myself but if the target audience don't enjoy it - is it really for them?","13 March 2022",6,150,256
"Turning Red","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free thoughts, please follow my blog to read my full review :)

""Turning Red is undoubtedly the riskiest, possibly the most divisive work in Pixar history. Without any remorse or restraint, Domee Shi and Julia Cho unapologetically approach the sensitive topic of (female) puberty in a quite shocking, positively impactful manner.

A narrative that unquestionably explores the hormonal, emotional, and sexual developments of its characters, conveying a message of self-acceptance and understanding of human evolution through its metaphors loaded with youthful excitement.

With the well-known technical attributes from the successful studio, this film will serve as an essential companion for all pre-teens who will deal with or are going through this inevitable and ""inconvenient"" phase of life.

One of the best movies of the year until this day.""

Rating: A-","12 March 2022",8,58,114
"Turning Red","This film has a decent premise. But the plot and characters feel very cliche and boring, with the main theme being a good message but poorly portrayed.

The art style is HORRIBLE. The character models look like some cheap bowling alley screen display characters.

This film lacks Disney Pixars magic. What happened to the creativity of Monsters Inc, Up, Coco?","10 March 2022",1,275,563
"Turning Red","The animation is really, really good, as expected from Pixar, but they wasted it by making their first film to completely break their mold by having a target audience. Pretty much every one of their movies attempts to be likable by all people of all ages, so I'm not sure why they did this, but the movie is solely targeted at preteen girls and no one else at all, and the plot is entirely focused on explaining puberty. The plot is weird and awkward, and every moment of screentime jumps back and forth between extremely cringey or mind-numbingly cliche. At least it has a consistent plot, so it's still better than Encanto, but not by much.","12 March 2022",2,311,706
"Turning Red","Let me put it this way: a genius way to present a subject is to make it so watchable from so many angles that it will represent something to each viewer. Take Mafalda comics as example: once can read it is a kid, as a teenager or as an adult. It makes different senses, it means different things.

That was Pixar's films from its start to 2010 or so.

Since then, each new film has the same audience target. And it's not me. It's every time ticking the same boxes: friendship, family, self-maturing. With a touch of magic or oneirism.

Visuals are great, music is blah, jokes are nah, it is not super enjoyable and it is very much forgettable.

I hope animation gets out of this dark age.","14 March 2022",2,151,293
"Turning Red","My oldest daughter was thrilled as we watched ""Turning Red"", as she really could relate to the main character, Mei and her struggles with the emergence of puberty. It's something that might make many men uncomfortable...but it IS a part of life that has long been ignored in movies. So, while the film is clearly a metaphor for a girl's first period, it's pretty amazing that any film would talk about this in any way....and my advice to guys is just accept it and enjoy the story. As a father with two daughters, I got over my fears of female sexuality and puberty long ago....and like the film seems to say, it's NOT a curse or something that should be a taboo.

Mei Lin is an 8th grader whose transition to puberty is MUCH worse than she could have imagined. This is because party of puberty is also the onset of a family curse (or gift...depending how you look at it). What is the curse? Well, when women from this Chinese-Canadian family lose their emotional control, they literally become giant red pandas. Now red pandas are about the cutest animals on the planet, but a 7 foot (or larger) red panda is difficult to explain!! The film is about Mei Lin's struggle...as well as how her mother and extended family also struggle with this beast within them.

As you'd expect from Pixar, the animation is lovely and the film looks pretty. I also appreciated the daring plot. My only regret is that the first half of the story is great...the last half is a bit formulaic...especially the big confrontation scene between Mei Lin and her mother at the stadium. It's not at all bad....just a bit disappointing. Overall, it's a film girls will adore and guys will like IF they let themselves appreciate and aren't afraid to see a film about girls' first period.","30 April 2022",7,28,55
"Turning Red","The movie delivers it's message quite strongly in the beginning but as the story goes on, things become more and more weird and I think it's mainly because Pixar is out of touch with the younger generation and didn't know how to progress the story whilst keeping the underlying message.

The scenes where the movie spiraled downhill was particularly when the kids started making money by selling their photos of the Panda and doing all kinds of weird favors, it just tacks on with a weird undertone which I think is one of the more toxic traits being reinforced in the younger generation. You would think that students who get straight A's would know of better ways to make money than selling photos of their appearance. (That is how poor the message became in the second half, that their value is based on their appearance)

The story could've easily become something more wholesome, but they were clearly lazy in the writing.

I mean, if a twerking Panda is a positive trait then maybe I'm the one who is out of touch.","15 March 2022",2,91,183
"Turning Red","""Turning Red"" is an East meets West coming of age story with some ""I've become my mother"" as well.

The movie takes place in 2002 Toronto. The main character was Meilin (pronounced May-leen (Rosalie Chiang)), an effervescent Canadian thirteen-year-old of Chinese heritage. She was like most teens with parents: she behaved one way at home and totally differently at school. Still, she was a good girl with straight A's and friends. With her friends she was outgoing, sassy, and a ham. With her mother, Ming (Sandra Oh), she was obedient, helpful, and much more toned down. It wasn't like she was repressed at home, she loved helping her mother and pleasing her mother, it's just that her mother was a helicopter parent--always hovering over her.

One of Meilin's loves was 4-Town, a five-member boy band like Nsync or Backstreet Boys. 4 Town, and boys in general, is where Meilin's desires came to a head with her mother's opposition.

One ordinary day Meilin woke up a giant red panda. That would freak out anyone. She did her best to hide it and found that calming down actually made her transform back to normal, with the exception of red hair. She was going to keep the secret to herself until her mother absolutely humiliated her at school which brought the panda out of her. It was then that her mother had to have the ""I was looking for the right time to tell you"" talk. That part of the movie was very much like ""Teen Wolf"" (1985) when Michael J. Fox woke up and was a werewolf and his parents already knew about it.

""Turning Red"" was funny, upbeat, and entertaining. I enjoyed Meilin and her crew: Miriam (Ava Morse), Abby (Hyein Park), and Priya (Maiteyi Ramakrishnan). They all had their own distinct personalities, they weren't shy or ashamed, and together they made a very amusing quartet. Ming, Miriam's mother, was equally hilarious. Even though what she did was often mortifying for Meilin, it was done in such a humorous and entertaining fashion.

The whole movie came together quite nicely. The story was good and the characters were all a joy to watch. It was emotional without being depressing or a tearjerker. It was the type of emotionality I look for in an animation.","14 March 2022",8,65,145
"Turning Red","The idea, the metaphor is not bad, coming of age or rather turning red (and honor your parents but stay yourself). Pixar production and graphics as good as ever. What is missing in the latest productions, in my opinion, is the genius of Pixar. They seem closer and closer to a typical Disney production, beautiful and musical but not brilliant.

This decline, I fear, may be due to an excess of production wanted by the Disney company, and I understand it but, there is a big difference between a tailor's shop and an industrial distribution of clothing.

Although I am an adult (and perhaps for this reason), I loved Pixar because in the past its target has never been solely that of children, they have included adults. Outstanding Pixar movies like ""Wall-e"", ""Up"", ""Inside / Out"", ""Coco"", ""Finding Nemo"" and Dory, also ""Soul"", even more than the still wonderful ""The Incredibles"", ""Toy Story"", ""Ratatouille"" , ""Cars"" etc. They bring with them messages, often moving, that do not concern only our children but also adults. Indeed, some messages are not immediately understandable by a very child / adolescent audience but they leave the fun to them anyway. In fact liked these movies as much as my son did.

This latest movie as well as ""Brave"", to a lesser extent also ""Luca"", show a slight flattening to Disney standards which I'm not saying are bad but they lack that typical modern tell and sneaky, Pixar genius.","13 March 2022",6,51,105
"Turning Red","The beginning of the movie is a beautiful and cute description of life as a preteen. But just around the halfway mark the storytelling basically stops and there's nothing but hammer-blow-subtle messaging. If you agree with the message you may not dislike it as much but even you will have to concede the sloppy storytelling and dramatic shift in tone.","13 March 2022",1,111,237
"Turning Red","Pixar often has a reputation of tugging at your heartstrings while delivering on emotional, intelligent storytelling, and lovable characters. This movie has none of that.

What is has are:
Annoying and one note characters that act like caricatures. Seriously, there's the tomboy, Asian stereotype, deadpan snarker, bully, tiger mom, etc.

A basic message of accepting who you are that they beat you over the head with.

A tired depiction of preteen girls as overly emotional and boy crazy. They tried to adapt the style of anime where characters act in an overexaggerated manner and it just comes of as really cringy.

This is the only Pixar movie I struggled to watch from start to end and would probably never watch again.","12 March 2022",5,192,380
"Turning Red","A splendid surprise on Disney Plus (not sure why this didn't see a theatrical release), ""Turning Red"" is a colorful, vibrant coming-of-age story, accessible to all ages but teens especially (my twelve-year-old in particular, she loves this movie). It uses the charm and wackiness of anime as a metaphor for puberty - who among us can't relate? - and I appreciate this subject matter in a Pixar movie. If only we could all Hulk out into a big giant fluffy panda at the first sign of strong emotion.

Well worth a watch; it feels personal, has a great sense of humor and it made me feel like a kid again, with all of the world-ending drama that entails.","10 April 2022",7,10,17
"Turning Red","Straight out the gate this movie not appropriate for all ages and those involved should be ashamed for not giving prior warnings to parents. I have no idea what movie those scoring this highly were watching but it's certainly not the movie I watched.

The main character is extremely arrogant and just not relatable or likeable and the mother is so far beyond controlling that she's a borderline psychopath and of course the father is just some overweight dude there for appearances.

I've no idea what message this sends to kids but it's not that puberty is natural and part of life but that it's a bizarre rollercoaster and you can pretty much do anything you want when experiencing it.","12 March 2022",1,89,179
"Turning Red","Pay attention to the rating.

It's PG = Parental Guidance.

It's not intended for 8 year olds.

Read the storyline. Read the reviews that have spoilers.

I found it a refreshing and light hearted look at the relationships smart and funny young girls have with each other, with their peers, and with their parents.

Yes they ""lie"" to try and go to a concert. Yes, the girls have crushes on boys. Yes they focus on the main character needing to be NOT overly dramatic. These things happen in real life to 13 year olds.

But they also show incredibly close relationships within family and extended family. They show how important respect for your elders is.","13 March 2022",9,25,42
"Turning Red","What is the message here? Parents doing their best to raise their kids right are completely wrong and should allow their kids to do and be whatever they want. This isn't just the classic parent just don't understand storyline it's much worse- it's parents are wrong if they stand in their children's way. No parent is prefect, and some put too much pressure on their kids, but this is more of an attack on conservative values and pushing the agenda of allowing kids to do and be whatever society influences them to be. Like everything in life, balance is the key to figuring out the complexities of our identity- this movie goes to the opposite extreme of strict parenting. Horrible message for kids and families alike.","26 March 2022",1,77,153
"Turning Red","Greetings again from the darkness. If only the transformation brought on by puberty were half as soft and cuddly as the giant Red Panda in this latest from Pixar, imagine the reduction in slammed doors and the increase in dinner table conversations between parents and young teenagers. Writer-director Domee Shi won an Oscar for her excellent animated short film BAO (2018), and has collaborated with co-writer Julia Cho for the director's first feature. It seems reasonable to assume that much of what we see on screen is taken from their own adolescent experiences, as well as those of countless others.

Meilin (voiced by Rosalie Chiang) is a 13-year-old 8th grader who fancies herself as a free-spirited teenager basking in her independence. However, the real story is that she's a straight-A student obediently following the highly structured life constructed by her mother. Mei's responsibilities include helping her mother clean the temple the family manages ... the oldest temple in Toronto. It not only serves the local Chinese community by paying homage to the Gods, but it also holds a sacred place for Mei's ancestors. Mei's mother keeps her so duty-bound, that she's unable to find time to karaoke with her friends.

One morning, after a particularly vivid and emotional dream, Mei is transformed into a giant Red Panda ... well she pops in and out of Panda state. Her mother Ming (Sandra Oh) quickly reacts assuming her daughter's ""change"" is the beginning of a menstrual cycle. But things change drastically when Ming finds out about the Red Panda. Her family has considered this a spell from the Gods, one that has followed the women for multiple generations. Mei discovers this when her grandmother and a slew of Aunts show up for the Red Moon ritual - the only way to rid Mei of the Red Panda.

Mei soon realizes her emotional outbursts are what cause the transformation. When she's overly excited or agitated, the Red Panda appears. It's mostly when she's calm and at ease around her friends that she's her 'normal' self. In fact, the friendships are the key to this story. Miriam (Ava Morse), Priya (Maitreyi Ramakrishnan), and Abby (Hyein Park) immediately rally to Mei's defense and accept these startling changes. They even find a way to use it to their advantage, focusing on an upcoming concert by 4-Town, a 5 member (yep) boy band that the girls are gaga about. The music for 4-Town is co-written by Billie Eilish and Finneas O'Connell, and is humorously in line with what we'd expect (and remember) from a 2002 boy band.

We watch as Mei struggles with the emotional rollercoaster that brings out the Red Panda. It's refreshing to see such a portrait of friendship, and also acknowledge that overbearing parents can cause stress, no matter how caring they might be. Mei learns that by letting go of the perfect kid syndrome and wallowing in her messy self, she can truly discover who she is as a young person. It's a Pixar movie, so we fully expect life lessons and psychology to play a role. And that's also part of the problem here. Being a Pixar film means you get compared to other Pixar films, and that's a crazy high standard. This one doesn't come close to the best work from the studio, although we welcome the rare look at female adolescence and friendship, as well as the impact a mother-daughter relationship can have on multiple generations.

"Turning Red","I rarely give low ratings below 5-6, almost never actually. This is my 2nd movie which gets a rating below 4 and honestly I don't think it's low enough.

1. The mother accuses a person of a being a predator and no consequences for her. Is that what children should be taught? That they can just accuse people of such things?

2. They destroy public property and terrorize people, and they get away with it.

3. 13 year olds twerking and slapping their butt, even if they are transformed into an animal... Doesn't matter if it's a sausage or a can of soup, actions are actions regardless!

4. Kids sneaking out in the middle of the night to attend a concert she wasn't supposed to be at? Nice!

"Turning Red","Listen, this is an incredible movie. I've seen people comment on how this film is telling us to 'not listen to your parents and lie' and how the message of this movie is clearly wrong- well those people are obviously missing the point here.

It's about growing up! And that growing up is about finding yourself and finding a balance between making your parents proud AND finding out who YOU are, and not just being the perfect image of who the people around you expect you to be.

The director herself even said she's not quite sure what the answer is, or even is there is a balance, but that it's a mix between the two.

So yeah.

Watch this movie.

Enjoy it.

It's a wonderful tribute to growing up, dealing with changes, and finding yourself amongst it all. And if you're a parent watching this with your kid, and they ask 'uncomfortable' questions after it.. Just answer them truthfully and set a good example for them.

"Turning Red","In the latest Pixar movie, Rosalie Chiang voice a 12-year-old girl in Toronto in 2002. She is the daughter of a tiger mother, has nervous breakdowns when she comes in second in spelling bees, and is securely under the thumb of her mother -- voiced by Sandra Oh -- although she adores a boy band, of which her mother severely disapproves. But being at that age, she finds a change in her body: under great emotional stress, she turns into a giant red panda. This turns out to be true of all the women in her family.

In what may be described as 'fantasy autobiography' -- the director was born in China, moved to Canada at 2, and was twelve for most of 2002 -- we see the expected Pixar combination of technical excellence -- the red panda looks like a plush doll, with every one of its million or two hairs carefully drawn -- and story telling. It hews a little too closely between its literal and figurative meaning -- we're dealing with menarche in some form -- with jokes about her mother bringing tampons and similar products to school, embarrassing the protagonist. But I laughed out loud and leaked some tears, and what more can you demand of any movie?","13 March 2022",7,66,155
"Turning Red","The movie is funny at the starting point. I thought, it's about how a girl behaves or gone through a situation when she in puberty and how she manages friends and family at the same time. But in the mid way, the girl actually annoyed me, like seriously, she is giving more priority to her friends than family. However,she leaves friends because she want's be a mom's ideal girl. I assumed, turning red and becoming red punda would be mood swing phrase of the girl's life but sadly,it isn't.","16 March 2022",5,60,137
"Turning Red","Charming and relatable, if a bit of an odd child among the rest of the Pixar films in the family, Turning Red does have some familiar moments- but is just weird, fun, and heartfelt enough to let you ignore some small originalities. I honestly really enjoyed this film, the animation was vibrant and unique, the story was very heartfelt- as well as its messages- and it was just entertaining to watch in general. The film does have some very familiar themes and ideas to other animated works- reminding me deeply of Lakia's 2012 film Paranorman of which I am incredibly fond of. Thankfully the film does manage to go beyond those ideas and think much for itself, but you can't help but feel at times it drags it down at least a tad in terms of quality. Besides that though, the film is very well written. It does a great job with its subtext of puberty, asian culture, and growing up with strict parents in general. For me I found a lot of similar moments between my own life and the parents on screen, the disgust of differences and changes in their kids life- like my own parents acted to many of my own life choices. It felt very genuine, very personal, and very honest- and is something Pixar always finds new ways of doing to make me cry. In the end, Turning Red isn't Pixar's best but is certainly a very worthy film in its ever expanding catalogue- full of plenty of fun moments and loads of heart- it certainly won't be a film you soon forget.

My Rating: 8.6/10.","11 March 2022",9,62,145
"Turning Red","A very lighthearted movie about, by now, pretty standard topics. Simply put there are quite a lot of other tf animated movies with a very similar premise. All in all, pretty standard with some a above average pixarlike animation style.

The worst part was the animation though. All the characters are so lazily animated and just plain ugly. It looks like something you would see on cartoon network (and I don't mean that in a good way). I was seriously cringing the whole way through the movie. If I hadn't been watching with someone, I probably would have turned it off after the first ten minutes. Actually, on second thought, I wouldn't have watched it at all.","15 March 2022",1,95,209
"Turning Red","This. Just. Sucked. What was the purpose of this? There had to be committees deciding which Pixar movies get made, right, so what group of people sitting around a table thought this was a great Disney/Pixar film? Girls won't like this just because you think you're being relatable by shoving the things girls *don't* want to discuss with strangers, or even family, right on screen where they have to all sit together and pretend it's not uncomfortable. May some people say ""aww, you just have hang-ups""? Maybe, but that's a minority and if they want to make a movie for a small minority - say those that like to host a dinner party and sit down to talk about menstruation and hot dreams, go for it. Otherwise, hopefully lesson learned and they can do better next time.","8 April 2022",1,33,65
"Turning Red","Two minutes into the movie & i hated the lead girl & her friends already. They are the definition of typical 13-year old brats who think it is somehow cool to disobey your parents cos' they think they are ""brainwashed"" by the society.

What was the message here exactly?? To show the parents or family in a bad light who care the most about you?! Or to fantasize about boys being mermaids?! Or is it to use your powers to make some money for a concert?! I don't know & i surely don't think that it is to embrace who you truly are! And why do this woke Disney thinks that every 13 year old girl acts & thinks like that?! I have a 13 year old sister & thank god she do not acts like any of those brats & guess what she DID NOT liked the movie either.

Tell me Disney if I agree with her mom (for the most part until they intentionally tried to show that she's a big evil monster!) does that make me look bad or am I not included in your woke people's list? Lmao.. Never felt more annoyed after watching a kids movie. Just wake up ""woke"" disney & stop brainwashing kids by making them watch your woke trash.

Note to myself: Be aware at what your kid watches in the name of animation from now on.

Easily skippable (as it also does not have a proper plot & is predictable too). DO NOT recommended watching, especially with your kids.

Rating - 1/10.","5 April 2022",1,50,110
"Turning Red","Ok I get I'm not the target audience for this film. That being said I wasn't the target audience for Inside Out or Dora the explorer and I loved those films. Why? Because they were well made with a story and characters and a plot and you know... film stuff. This is just bad. Bad animation, bad voice acting, cringe worthy ""characters"" a plot that isn't and gahhhhhhh I just can't go on. Seriously, no one should be made to sit through this tripe. Pixar what have you become?","12 March 2022",1,65,133
"Turning Red","Starts off really strong and promising, with some decent characters and relatable themes; extremely controlling migrant parents, the urge to rebel against them, the awkwardness of growing up, family and responsibility etc, are all themes that most of us have been through before. However, the movie spirals downwards real fast at around the halfway point and it just gets laughably ridiculous (like trying to get tickets for a hugely popular concert right before the gig!), by the end of it you'd think they switched movies on you and hoped you wouldn't notice. However, having said that the animation, character design, and overall production is amazing and topnotch as you would expect from Pixar.","12 March 2022",5,75,173
"Turning Red","I wasn't a fan of this film at all. Pixar has had some incredible productions throughout its tenure, but could we be witnessing in real time, the decline on the once great film studio?

Don't get me wrong, the animation is good and I'm sure this will turn a profit for them. However, the last couple of films (including this one) that they've released have been a bit of a yawn for me.

I'm also not sure I liked the message that it was trying to send, or what I perceived as the message anyway.

I liked the inclusivity and yes we need more monitory stories to be told, but overall I wasn't a fan of this.","13 March 2022",1,70,142
"Turning Red","If you copy Teen Wolf, 1985 starring Michael J. Fox and paste it into Pixar in 21st century, you get Turning Red. This animation signifies that Pixar is no longer a creative powerhouse.","12 March 2022",1,100,239
"Turning Red","An Asian Canadian teenage girl turns into a giant red panda she has to control her emotions to keep it from getting out. It's a very girly movie dealing with crushes and her group of girl friends trying to go see a boy band. Not for made for me I think. Excellent animation to be expected and another unique plot from Pixar. It plays heavily on the high achiever Asian mother stereotype (is stereotype the right word? Idk) obviously pulling on some first hand account. I am not Asian, so it might touch on some uncomfortable opinions.

Strangely it's set 20 years in the past, probably to avoid todays news. And to remind the writer of her childhood. So if you were a teenage girl back in 2002 I can safely say this movies for you.","12 March 2022",5,69,169
"Turning Red","Literally the very first Disney movie that all of my kids couldn't finish watching...not sure who the target audience is, but there is minimal broad appeal, zero humor, and nothing much happening at all.

Sad excuse for a Disney film.","12 March 2022",2,71,155
"Turning Red","On both narrative and animation levels this film stretches what Pixar has done. Stylistically, this film has a lot more overt anime influences-i.e. The puppy dog eyes, the poofs of smoke during the transformations, etc.-than Pixar usually does. Don't get me wrong the animation is up to the Pixar standard but it feels like a new studio because they allowed their characters to be far more expressive, ""cartoony"" than Pixar usually does. The innovation in animation is minor compared to the narrative Pixar gets away with.

The narrative has two features that set it apart from other Pixar works. First the characters feel more grounded and realistic than what Pixar usually does-as in the film tries have their characters 100% living persons as opposed dramatically compelling archetypes. The main characters are all tween girls and the script nails everything about that age correct; to hysterical and touching results. (A consequence of this is the primary audience for this film *is* tween girls through nearly everyone will get something from it. ) Second, the film is a giant metaphor primarily for puberty-Mei phasing in and out of panda shape stands for raging hormones, puberty nonsense. The film explicitly links turning into a panda with Mei's mother being concerned that Mei's menstrual cycle is starting up. I.e. The mother thinks Mei gets her first period the first time she becomes a panda. AND the panda magic is linked to the lunar cycle. It is refreshing to see such material in a family film-let alone a Disney released film.

The film ends up being up to Pixars standards by being one of their riskier projects. This is funny, touching, smartly observed and well great. I prefer a lot of Pixar over this-including Luca from last year-but I am sure for a lot of people this will be the best Pixar.

Domee Shi-who directed and co-wrote the script-is a really gifted filmmaking judging by this and the Oscar winning short Bao. I am very curious to see what she does next because *obviously* both Bao and Turning were heavily influenced from her life as Chinese-Canadian. I think she might be best among the 3rd generation of Pixar. Time will tell.","17 March 2022",10,38,92
"Turning Red","This movie has a few funny moments and I wanted to like this movie BUT .... It's not for children. This movie literally glorifies disobeying your parents so you can be your true self. Worst family values I've seen in a kids movie. There's also weird out of place comments that shouldn't be in a kids movie. Like the main characters 'sexy drawings' she does in her notebook. If you have young kids, skip this Disney movie for sure.","13 March 2022",1,120,293
"Turning Red","In this film, reference is made to puberty and the physical changes that are representative of this stage.

The film makes a metaphor for puberty and menstruation, although this metaphor can be confusing since it changes constantly and the meaning of what it represents or what it is referring to is lost. It also portrays the sudden mood swings, physical changes, and emotional repercussions that come with it, as well as how dealing with your parents' expectations of you can be self-defeating. It also shows us that we must accept ourselves and our personality and we must not pretend to be something that we are not because that never leads to anything good. In the long run, the movie becomes very dramatic and some characters become very annoyed by their stubborn attitude that don't get much development, just as other characters get very little development. The movie is funny at times, reflecting on the importance of friendship and the ups and downs of growing up. The animation is good but not as dazzling as the studio's previous films.

The film has several parts that work well alone, but all together can become too much and even fail to complement each interesting situation that the film touches on, but it can still be enjoyable for children despite its flaws in the story.","15 March 2022",6,17,36
"Turning Red","Turning Red is another movie that examines the relationship between mother and child. It tries to blend serious with disney fantasy but winds up confused. It's a coming of age story centering around Meilin, a 13 year old Chinese girl who tries to spread her time between being a free-spirit and adhering to the large expectations of her mother. But things are changing for her; she's more into boys, concerts, and concerts concerning boys. At its heart is a strained mother-daughter relationship: one sadly based on the old Chinese cliche of the Tiger mom who will tolerate nothing more from her daughter than to live by family custom. It's a caricature played to overbearing effect here. But that's nothing compared with trying to connect with this story. For a film meant to open up a dialogue between mothers and daughters, it doesn't really give you much place to start. It's obviously not as top-notch as some other Pixar films. Probably the most aggregious issue is that the heart and emotion of the feature doesn't hit nearly as hard as it was trying to. The choice to be more cartoonish ends up draining the impact in some heartfelt moments. In all, while the film deserves praise for talking about puberty in such depth but its styling choices, predictable plot, and occasionally cringey dialogue are a turn-off for me.","22 September 2022",4,6,10
"Turning Red","The victory of banal pop teen culture over the wisdom of traditional Asian culture. It's the tired Disney formula of a child finding enlightenment through rebellion which ends up somehow bringing the protagonist closer to her family in the end. The animation is beautiful as always. Story sucks. Get some imagination Disney! It's supposed to be what you're good at...","14 March 2022",1,60,138
"Turning Red","3 out of 5 stars.

Turning Red is a fair family film about a girl turning into her teen years. And has a family curse where she turns into a red panda until they can break the ritual. Meanwhile, she and her friends are trying to raise money so they can go to a boy band concert.

The plot is okay. The up and coming story is great. The concept with Mei being a panda is fun and cute. The rest of the film is cheesy and forgettable. The teen girls being obsessed with the boy band is fun. The humor is okay. The animation is okay. The music score is nothing memorable. It is one pixar movie that is easily forgotten.","28 March 2022",6,17,38
"Turning Red","I absolutely loved Turning Red even though I don't particularly go for children animation films. Its themes are highly appealing and eye-opening: Asian family values, the growing pains of adulthood and the conflicts between friendship and filial piety. It is a gorgeous visual feast and smart too, interposing Japanese anime styles with the more traditional Pixar digital wizardry And bravo Pixar for letting a female (Asian) director (Domee Shi) - helm this memorable production. It's long overdue. Plenty of food for thought here.","24 March 2022",9,9,16
"Turning Red","This movie has a giant problem, and it's not necessarily the red panda. As a dad with 2 girls about ready for this stage, I welcomed the humor and idea of a movie about the quirks of the age and most importantly, how to overcome and become better.

But, it wasn't funny and it was way too over the top trying to squeeze as many innuendos in as possible.

Maybe had they skipped about 20 minutes of fluff and destruction and gotten to the moral of the story faster with less distractions, it would have been better I think.","12 March 2022",5,52,115
"Turning Red","The most unrealistic thing about this movie is that the girls would expect to buy tickets for the biggest Boys Band Ever the day before the gig!

If you're a Japanese anime fan you'll know that the transformation thing is clearly copied on Ranma 1/2. Plus the idea of a girl with a scary power that frightens her immediate family and pushes her friends away until she realizes what is really important in life, sounds weirdly familiar, FROZEN anyone? I guess Disney likes to rely on certain ideas.

More seriously this story concept was probably more suitable for a 1 minute candy/ soda advert than a full movie. It's watchable and cute but not that memorable compared to A-list PIXARs although I would probably watch a 4-Town spin off series because the songs are good!","11 March 2022",3,54,131
"Turning Red","Pretty disappointing for a Pixar movie. Would not watch more than once. Boring and the mother's character was so annoying and over the top while the father wasn't even rememberable.","14 March 2022",5,56,111
"Turning Red","As a Chinese American I have to say that I'm very disappointed by this movie. Seriously what is the movie trying to teach the kids? To be youself and don't listen to your parnets at the age of 13? Or to sneak out of the house at the middle of the night? Or go to a not child appropriate concert without parents permission? The main characters are teens, they are at the very age that can be easily misled by these wrong messages. This is the most irresponsible movie that Pixar has made.","12 March 2022",1,99,182
"Turning Red","You can tell that the creators really put their heart into this film and imbued it with all the experiences they had growing up, but in a way that's relatable to everyone. Set in early 2000s Toronto, Meilin Lee has to navigate her way between parental approval and forging her own way in life. What could be a trite premise ends up being a delight due to fleshed out characters, expressive pastel-toned animation and an emotionally deep plot that resonates with anyone under the pressure of helicopter parents.","19 March 2022",8,20,47
"Turning Red","Just for its sheer charm, energy, and pace, Turning Red gets an 8/10 from me. The reality of life in the 8th grade with 13-year-old Mei Lin and her friends is captured quite possibly better than any live-action version could have done. And the big red panda -- brilliant. Not only is she REALLY big, and insufferably cute, but I loved the way the animation uses the ears and eyes to express her different emotional states. Mei Lin's three friends Abby, Miriam, and Priya are more than just superficially multicultural, they all have distinctive voices and personalities. It really works, too, that they are voiced by genuinely young actors. Urban Toronto as a setting for the story is spot-on and fits like a glove.

I thought it did fall off a bit in the third act -- the action kind of went over the top (for me, anyway), and we didn't need the voiceover at the end to make the moral of the story explicit (we all have a beast inside who's kind of a mess, so accept it and let it live -- yeah, we got that). But that's just a minor cavil on what is another successful Pixar production.","24 July 2022",8,6,10
"Turning Red","I love cartoons and animated films. The movie's description led me to believe it was going to be an interesting movie, but I found the characters to be quite obnoxious. Some of the scenes they show is not something I would recommend for young kids.

I'm disappointed with this generation and what kids are being shown. Pixar has many good movies, but this one isn't it. The fact that this movie has gained popularity makes me even more worried. Kids and teens deserve movies that are creative, inspiring, and fun.","24 March 2022",1,30,66
"Turning Red","LOOK at the top ten reviews - they are right, Not one in 10 of them ranks this above a five. Honestly, I almost turned this off within the first 15 min. It starts off REALLY annoying - like the movie forgot to take it's Ritalin after downing a 40 oz of Mtn Dew. It got somewhat better, but I never LOL'd even once. (Having said that, I don't think I am the demographic this was aimed at, because typing LOL in a review really irritates me.)

It's not all bad - the animation is great, as would be expected, although the bean-headed character thing is getting a little tired.

Overall this is vey much a teenage girl flick, set in the early 2000's with tons of references to that time period. PowerPuff girls, (Yeah, the eye thing, we got it. Over and over and over.) Tamagotchis, ""BackStreet Boys"" and probably others I ignored.

The thing that I love about most PIXAR films is that they are sort-of timeless and usually have universal themes, stories and characters that everyone can related to. This is not like that. The humor is not as clever as you would expect - it's pretty immature really. I get the Asian/ Chinese parent thing, but as a critical element to hinge the entire premise of your movie on? Even if you boil it down to breaking away from your parents expectations, that concept has been done so much more thoughtfully and touchingly than this.

I think this would have done poorly at the theater. Even when I saw the preview for it IN the theater I remember thinking ""This doesn't look like typical PIXAR quality."" and I would not have paid to see it, BUT it was free with Disney+ so I watched it hoping my initial reaction was wrong.

It wasn't.

I imagine someone with DisneyCorp knew this and decided not to risk it. A box-office flop would not have been good press, and this way it just gets swept under the rug and largely forgotten. Mark my words, when enough people have seen this and reviewed it, it's going to rank really low compared to all the rest.","16 March 2022",4,50,113
"Turning Red","Just watched the movie on Disney and it was amazing. It was an amazing friendship and family story and almost made me cry the message is beautiful.

Love the movie will 100% watch again.","11 March 2022",10,37,73
"Turning Red","The style is more like Luca but pretty to look at if you don't mind strobe effects.

Popart like but not as well executed as say Big Hero 6. The story is fine. I mean it's a coming of age classic trope told in a way we've seen before at least a billion times. Extremely unoriginal but it's cute.

You know the real issue, is that it is in the vein of all Pixar movies now. They're just kinda, eh. Watchable but not special. I dawned on me that they have not made anything special since they fired John Lassiter and he apparently took what made Pixar special with him on the way out. Too bad, Pixar was the gem in the crown and now their straight to home video.","12 March 2022",5,44,101
"Turning Red","This film is just strange from the off! Who is it aimed at? There are themes and plot lines which are meant for much older children/teens. The section which references her first period is just so strange! When you think of Pixar, you don't imagine a young girl fantasizing about boy bands with an overbearing mother who wants to help with period problems!! Weird!!","12 March 2022",1,51,111
"Turning Red","This film is about a 13 year old Chinese-Canadian girl named Meilin who turns into a red panda anytime she is overwhelmed with emotion. And the panda is freaking adorable and this is a really cool idea because who wasn't getting really overwhelmed at that age! However, the characters in this film are so obnoxious! Whether it is the teenage girls whose entire identities center around their love for a fictional boy band or Meilin's mom who is so over the top embarrassing that it's impossible to believe, there really aren't any characters who are easy to identify with or are fun to watch. Finally, what is the metaphor of the panda in the film? Is it puberty? Is it individuality and forgoing tradition? Is it embracing your emotions and insecurities? Well, it could be all and none of these things, as the director isn't very direct with the plot. So, overall this is a fine movie but it really could have been a great one.","13 March 2022",6,16,34
"Turning Red","Horrible weird graphic work and drawings, totally unfitting voice for the main lead (Mei), boring less than good plot and a total failure after Encanto.","14 March 2022",4,31,71
"Turning Red","This movie looked like a good time and a fun family movie. Instead this is a SNOOZE to sit through this movie is boring with an hour and 47 minute runtime the pacing is TERRIBLE.... not even 30 minutes in I was checking my watch waiting for the movie to be OVER. There is 1 good moment in this movie but not enough to waste almost 2 hours worth of your time.","14 March 2022",1,43,100
"Turning Red","This is a far cry from the Pixar we've grown to love over the years! Disrespect for adults, lying, crude behavior, my kids didn't even laugh! It was detached from reality - no redeeming message and disappointing.","27 March 2022",1,27,48
"Turning Red","First off, all the reviews complaining about woke themes need to chill. Many of the cast are Canadian, and Toronto is a multicultural city. You need to grow up and stop reaching deep just because you're insecure about the world around you.

I rated the movie a 5. It might be a good movie for a 12-14 year old, but most kids are too young for it, and adults can't really relate. Very awkward at times, which is probably what it was going for, but it just didn't land. I liked the animation but that was basically it.","13 March 2022",5,16,29
"Turning Red","I love Pixar. But I hated this movie. First of all, there is some not so subtle references to a young girl starting her period, talking about cramps and pads. I would HATE to have to answer all the questions from my young boys about what in the world the mother is talking about. I would also hate to tell my daughter about this life fact because it was introduced to her, too young, in this movie.

Also, and more importantly, Mei-Mei is a horrible example. Encouraging kids to disobey and lie to parents because they won't understand them. Encouraging kids to do this is dangerous, and that is not an exaggeration.

I don't have the desire to continue on how much I hated this. The movie was trash. Will never let my kids watch this.","15 March 2022",1,42,89
"Turning Red","Turning Red is a great Pixar movie that plays almost entirely to the studio's strengths, a funny and emotional film with a surprisingly epic finale. It also manages the impressive feat of feeling both deeply personal yet also universally relatable.

Rosalie Chiang gives a phenomenal lead performance that's instantly likeable and full of joy with plenty of emotional range. Sandra Oh is incredible as a hyper vigilant parent hiding her own fears and doubts.

Domee Shi's direction is excellent, it's extremely inventive with its animation and has some jaw dropping moments of beauty. The song by Billie Eilish and Finneas is extremely memorable and fits the film perfectly.","12 March 2022",8,44,122
"Turning Red","The panda is cute, the story aint.

Storywise it's like michael j fox teen wolf, also this animation is more chic movie telling bout teenage girl growing up etc.

So kids probably can't relate much, the one they like in the movie is panda and cute kittens, that's it.

It just fell flat & forgettable.","15 March 2022",1,33,75
"Turning Red","This movie is exactly what I wanted the 2020 release of ""Over The Moon"" to be..
A very focused, quite cohesive and super energetic (yet highly stylized) tale of a young girl and her family woes, with a sprinkle of mystic and magic, but one that didn't shy away from it and heavily leaned in that direction for that which only animation can achieve! One that, through a well-crafted emotional layer, lingers as a very memorable story. Pixar managed to make it even more visually appealing.. which allows for the script and acting to inject SO much personality and charm into every character. It's surprising how effortless they make it seem. Every action, reaction, face, lines of dialogue, interaction and bombastic visual effects! Adding a bit of musical ""flare"" is just the cherry on top. It all seems tuned to perfection.

Now, I enjoyed it as a 30+ male, and I'm not entirely sure this would be something a younger kid (specially) female would entirely enjoy or understand..

Still, personally, wouldn't change a thing, and would definitely watch again!","12 March 2022",9,24,62
"Turning Red","Well Congrats guys, Disney somehow found a way to ruin Pixar too. I mean what was that? I'm really disappointed to see such a repetitive and overused plot again and again. The new concepts that company is inforcing to its newer movies, seem just too much. And the characters as much as the creators might think, are not funny or cute.

Also, is this an accurate image of the new age? I mean if it is, then ...","12 March 2022",1,49,98
"Turning Red","A lot of people are complaining about the story, character development, saying things are rushed, but personally I had no problem with it. It's on point like most Pixar films. Hell I even enjoyed the animation, it's something a little different and it's honestly kinda charming. So why did I give it a 6/10? The jokes! The jokes in this film are so cringy and bad it takes a lot out of it. I get some of them are about the pains of hitting puberty but a lot of them could've landed better. I just feel like Pixar wants to create straight drama sometimes and the mouse forces them to include comedy. Either way it's a mostly enjoyable watch.","13 March 2022",6,2,2
"Turning Red","There are no redeeming qualities in this show. Sends 12 year old message to do whatever they want, you're a woman now because you got your period? Not to mention the crazy insane mom they put into this? It's also too intense to be a PG animation. This is a no go for me. No positive messages in this.","20 March 2022",1,23,52
"Turning Red","The spiritual sequel to Inside Out, it's a sweet-hearted celebration of teenage rebellion and a fearless study of female adolescence...and the closest Pixar may ever get to making a PG-13 movie. Not that it's too lewd or indecent for the younger crowd, but a teen comedy about getting your period usually makes the suits bristle. It's more than that, though; it's a sharp, hilarious critique of how we drive women to shut off their emotions in order to be ""acceptable.""","24 March 2022",8,19,49
"Turning Red","I don't care what anyone else says, THIS is the best Pixar movie.

Just to get this out of the way, the animation is fluid and expressive, the comedy is superb (probably made me laugh harder than any other Pixar movie), and the story is a fun ride that goes from calm and laid-back to intensely dramatic towards the end.

The family drama to me personally hit harder than Encanto, though I feel that movie was more relatable to the wider audience.

Now the main thing I loved about this movie was the themes of acceptance, choice, and expectation. I know what it's like to fail to live up to what a parent expects. I know what it's like to feel bundled up away from who you are. I know what it's like to be like this.

To me the Red Panda Spirit is analogous to the jungian shadow, the part of ourselves we repress and refuse to acknowledge. What that shadow is depends on the person. And I feel this movie can be read a lot of different ways because of it.

""I won't regret this, right?""

That single line hit harder for me than the endings of Coco and Soul combined.

It's not a film for everyone, but if it's for you, you're in for an amazing rode.

So, what's your red panda?

Will you embrace it or seal it away?

The choice is yours alone.","13 March 2022",10,21,35
"Turning Red","This movie should have a warning and age restriction it is inappropriate and uncomfortable to watch. An extremely annoying teen that gets her period, loves her friends more than her parents and draws inappropriate pictures in her journal under her bed and is boy crazy! When the teen becomes a panda (metaphor for period) she turns angry and needs to be controlled... so they are saying women are crazy and super emotional when red. The elder women teach her about how to control the ""Red Panda"" at the end realizing that all her ancestors of the past had this same experience but one day the panda goes away, the mom walks inside a hole that basically says goodbye to her menstruation forever.

Disney productions are formulaic and conservative and musical, even when they try their best to be modern, they give you consistent quality for a template that they know works and it doesn't matter how much money it takes, even if it leans too much on princesses for some reason. Well, Turning Red feels like a true Pixar/Disney production, a mash between the two styles that doesn't quite work.

This is the story of an Asian teenage girl who has to juggle growing up into a new adult and the pressure of always being the perfect little daughter that makes her entire line of ancestors proud. As such, she has to choose who is the person who she wants to become, while convincing her family and perhaps herself that is the path forward. Is the red thing a metaphor for female menstruation? Perhaps it started like that, but the story is quite literally a coming of age one, focusing on emotional growth.

I liked the dynamics between the daughters and mothers and the four friends, I liked the kind quiet dad who lets mom call the shots, but has his own beliefs and influence on his family, creating the balance that leads to harmony. In a way, this is a story about finding balance, whoever you are, between self, family and friends. However, I believe too much special effects were used which took away from the story. The plot was quite predictable and lacked that magic Pixar usually brings, instead going a bit Disney princess. Most of the real life dynamics regarding the existence of magical pandas were ignored completely, which made it feel like the main metaphor is the only thing they put some work in and from there you just have to suspend all disbelief to enjoy the film. The rest just flows in the familiar pattern of Disney films, linear and comfortable.

Bottom line: perhaps aimed a little too much towards children, or not having the resources to dedicate more creative time for the story, or maybe even studio interference made the movie feel too Disney and too little Pixar. I enjoyed it and surely the voice acting was great, but I thought the animation was average and the story derivative.","20 April 2022",7,6,12
"Turning Red","I'm just so tired of these same type of kids' movies over and over again. This is the 86th ""Just be yourself"" kids' movie and it is the straw that has broken this camel's back.

Now to get this out of the way, like all Pixar movies, this has all the technical stuff down beautifully. The animation, sound and voice acting is all on point. And in all honesty I can't say it's a bad movie...I just hate it.

This is yet another kids' movie where the parents are painted as the monsters and the friends are the ones that are there for unconditional love. With few exceptions in Disney animated films the parents are either the villainized or dead. Why does this ""family company"" seem to hate parents so much?

With so many of these films following this tired trope, why does this movie in particular get the brunt of my ire? Well for one, it's Pixar. This is an animation company that I have come to expect more than just run of the mill after school special tripe.

Second, this is 2022. We have heard this message before and it has been run into the ground. Heck, the last 3 Disney movies ( Luca, Ron's Gone Wrong and Encanto) all had the same ""Just be yourself, your flaws are what make you who you are"" message. In the same way stuff like ""Ferngully"" would get criticized for beating down the same environmental message we've been hearing since ""Bambi"", I will critique ""Turning Red"" for giving this same tired message.

And finally, this one lacks any subtlety. They beat you over the head with this message from the beginning of the movie all the way until they spell it out for you in the end. It makes ""Zootopia"" seem subtle. Also very on the nose about its puberty parallel. There just aren't any funny jokes you can make about menstruation, period.

The characters in this film, particularly the mom, act so over the top ridiculous that she inevitably ends up being set up as the simple strawman to knock down for the sake of the message. The way she reacts to certain plot points was so unbelievable it immediately took me out of the movie.

If you can get passed the narration at the beginning and not see exactly where the movie is going, and you're not sick of the ""parents are the worst"" cliche, then you'll likely enjoy the movie. I personally liked the setting and anime influence. But for me, in the words of another animated Panda, this movie gets ""ska-dooshed"".","23 March 2022",3,11,24
"Turning Red","Sure there were stereotypes, but nothing malicious. I will put it at par with Monster Inc.. Being in Toronto, my home turf, was a bonus; places were very familiar and accurately depicted. I was surprised that I liked it after a big disappointment from watching The Incredibles 2, after which I had had not seen any Disney or Pixar animations. Watch it, it is a gem for a family to watch together. Who
doesn't want to pinch the red panda!","12 March 2022",10,16,36
"Turning Red","Turning Red is about 13-year old girl from Toronto cursed with an ancient spell that turns her into an adorable red panda. Sounds like just another make-believe kids movie? Think again. This film and its story is a not-so-subtle allegory for puberty. It's wild that we're seeing a film like this come from, of all places, Pixar. Pixar has time and again told magical stories that reach deep into the emotions of just about everyone, but rarely, if at all, have they made a film this relatable. The characters of Turning Red are everyday people. You know them, you've grown up with them. If you're a Millennial or a Zoomer, you've certainly lived in this world. Turning Red embraces every cringey aspect of puberty, and when does, those are it's best moments. I also enjoyed the cultural mosaic that Turning Red captures of 2002 Toronto.","13 March 2022",7,22,59
"Turning Red","Well worth a watch, this.

'Turning Red' is a very good flick from Disney/Pixar. It's different in a way, I wasn't sure how it was going to turn out based on the first few minutes but by the end it provides the required and expected amount of entertainment and meaning.

The voice cast are excellent, I have no faults with them. Rosalie Chiang gives a performance full of energy in the lead role, while Sandra Oh puts in a strong display alongside Chiang. The rest of them are good too, as I also recognised James Hong and Lori Tan Chinn. Us UK viewers also have the bonus of a small role for Anne-Marie.","11 March 2022",8,42,127
"Turning Red","Was looking forward to watching this with my 5 year old since it was a Pixar movie. 15 minutes in they're drooling over boys and calling boys sexy. The main characters mother finds some drawings that her daughter drew of a boy and called them ""sexy pictures"" and ""did this boy do that to you?!"" Really Pixar? Slap a PG13 on the rating so we don't show our little kids this movie. Smh.","12 March 2022",1,18,35
"Turning Red","Unlikeable characters marketed to Canadians but meant for China money. If you wanted to make a movie for Canadians why not use indigenous characters? Harder to make money overseas but probably would be a more important movie.

It felt like a fake movie trailer in an Adam Sandler movie making fun of these kinds of movies. Amazing that all the reviews here are paid for by Disney social media interns.","12 March 2022",1,40,95
"Turning Red","Felt like an episode of a tween Disney show, not a movie. Horrible music, the most annoying characters and talk about cliches. If you want to make a Disney hygeine movie then do it, don't hide it in double talk and disrespect for the people that are there to help you. No heart and poor message. Yawn.","28 April 2022",1,10,20
"Turning Red","This is what Toronto looks like, it is an incredibly diverse city. Really, it is. This is not ""woke propoganda"", come visit sometime and you'll realize that this realy is just a cute coming of age story about a tween girl that's also a bit of a love letter to the director's home town.

If you feel the need to politicize that, then maybe that's just a you problem.","12 March 2022",9,20,35
"Turning Red","A lot of adults leaving reviews about how they personally liked this movie, but not much about their kids that this was intended for. Forget the review of the movie because it's really not that good.

It's just about a girl who gets her period (turns into a giant, red, hormonal monster). Yay, tell that to your 7yr old.","15 March 2022",4,18,35
"Turning Red","I can't remember the last time I related to, or rooted harder for, another protagonist. Her friends, too!

Do yourself a favor and give this a chance (especially past the halfway mark, trust me) - the naysayers are wrong, full stop.

Take care and be well. <3.","10 May 2022",10,11,18
"Turning Red","A very amusing and different take on a coming of age movie. The animation is a very.. unique.. and anime-ish style, which takes a while to get used to. And the 'dear diary' style of the movie kind comes and goes - so you're a bit undre as to who the main character is talking to - you or someone in the room with her.

And I'm also a but unsure as to who the audience is. Because I didn't get that this was back in 2002 - like is this made for the nostalgia crowd, the young teens, millenials, Chineese / Canadian people?

-_('-')_- You tell me.

I like the story in itself, and I like that Disney is trying to tell different stories from around the world - with Encanto/ Coco and now this.","11 March 2022",4,23,51
"Turning Red","I'm a 22 year old female who desires to become a teacher and was disappointed, to say the least, in the message behind this film. Embracing your emotions are important but if your emotions leads you to lie to your parents, listen to your bad influential friends, and care more about the lastest music than caring for other people, then you need to learn not to give into those emotions. It's so sad today to see kids having no respect for their teachers and/or adults who care deeply for them because they've been fed these message that they're allowed to do whatever they want without thinking of the consequences and the effect it has on other people and theirselves later on in life, and wondering when did things starting to go out of hand.

""My panda, my choice"" was the response she told her mom when her mom told her that her appearance was inappropriate. It seems innocent but guys, I'm begging you to look at the deeper message. Be careful what you allow your children to watch.","12 March 2022",1,47,88
"Turning Red","I usually watch animated movies before showing them to my kids. I skipped the vetting because Disney/Pixar. That was a mistake. Next thing I know I'm forced to have a strange forced period talk with my eight year old daughter. It was not the time or the place for that conversation. Sex education is crucial but I don't want it forced into cartoons meant for small kids. Let parents parent. Let kids be kids.","12 March 2022",1,16,26
"Turning Red","I really liked the trailer for this when I saw it last year, it looked fun.

I love Pixar movies and have seen every one of them several times bar Brave (which I just didn't like the look of) and Cars 2 and 3 (as I thought Cars 1 was awful)

But this one I really can't put my finger on. It had all the ingredients to be a fun 90 minutes but somehow it fails on almost every level.

There are a few funny moments in the film I'll give it that and it's colourful to the point where it almost burns your eyes but it just feels like a Nickelodian TV film. The production values are no where near what we're used to seeing in Pixar films, the animations and backgrounds just feel dull, flat and overly bright and colourful and it's distracting. The voice acting is poor, uninspired and feels like everyone involved just walked off of a kids TV show and the characters are just not fun. No one seems to have any personality in this and it's hard to identify with any of the characters.

I didn't like anyone in this, the main girls are annoying, screechy, teenage fluff, the whole boy band sub plot was unfunny, uninteresting and at times, really dull to sit through. It felt so low budget and made for TV and it's the first Pixar movie I've sat through where I was literally clock watching after about an hour wanting it to finish.

I don't know what's happening to Pixar just lately, they used to churn out classic after classic but thier output this last few years has really gone down the pan. Films like Onward and Luca were ok but way below thier usual standards, Monsters at work was awful and looked so cheap, and now this, the only film worthy of thier name they've done this last few years was Soul which was great.

Some younger audiences might really dig Turning red and it's not terrible per se, just a really big step down from thier usual movies.

It's the worst Pixar movie I have watched baring Cars, I even enjoyed it less than Onward and it's a shame Pixar are starting to lower thier standards.

If you have kids this one will be fine to put on to keep them quiet but I'll be surprised if many adults will get anything out of this.

Very average. 4/10.","15 March 2022",4,19,46
"Turning Red","For the life of me, I don't understand why there are people so upset with this movie. Yes, she disobeys her parents, but what kid hasn't done that?! I'm extremely close with both of my parents, and you bet your ass I disrespected them in high school. You can have the most supportive parents in the world and still go through all of the trials and tribulations of being a teenager. I'm sure that the people up in arms about this movie and being disgusted with how ""disrespectful"" this movie was have NEVER done ANYTHING wrong in their entire life and were just the most absolute perfect children growing up *cue huge eye roll* I thought this was a fun and cute movie about staying true to yourself and embracing who you are (all sides of yourself)!! I think it's great for kids to see movies like this to know that all of their emotions they're feeling are okay and normal!","13 March 2022",10,16,34
"Turning Red","I'll just start off by saying I didn't think Turning Red was as good as Encanto, Luca or Raya and The Last Dragon. It wasn't bad but it also wasn't the best that Pixar has produced.

The premise was very promising but there were a few cringe-worthy moments like when Ming is talking about Mei getting her menstrual cycle and then showing up at school with pads for Mei. Mei could be a bit of a brat and her mother was a bit judgmental but those are realistic character traits.

I would like to say that I like the inclusion of different cultures and ethnicities into Pixar and Disney movies. It's refreshing to see and it opens doors for different stories and tales. If that's ""too woke"" for people, then maybe you should just stop watching TV shows and movies. Better yet, stop viewing the world through your overly political lens and just enjoy things.

I recommend this movie for a lazy day when you can't find anything else to watch.","12 March 2022",6,12,26
"Turning Red","Not a comedy. Really just preachy. Kind of want my two hours back. My kids didn't really like it either. Age ten and twelve. If you're looking for a fun Disney movie this isn't it.","12 March 2022",1,55,116
"Turning Red","Okay, hear me out. I've NEVER had to screen Pixar movies before because we'll they're Pixar movies of course. My 7 year old was SO excited to watch this movie today after school. Me, being the mother I am and trusting Pixar, let my daughter start the movie while I was cooking.

Much to my surprise when I walked out I saw scenes where the daughter was hiding under her bed, sweating and drawing ""sexy"" photos of her and a boy. It was soooooo uncomfortable. I decided to fast forward a bit and give it a chance. Even after that there were many, many things that were obviously meant for kids age 13 and older.

Unfortunately it left my 7 year old with a slew of questions I was NOT ready to answer and topics I didn't want to bring up till a later age.

It's weird being in a position now where I feel like I need to screen a movie geared towards little kids, and Pixar at that, before I let my kid watch it. Not because I won't let her see it (I know she's gonna hear and see worse at school) but because I feel I will need to preface the movie with a conversation on certain topics.

Weird.","12 March 2022",1,16,28
"Turning Red","The obnoxious way over the top antics of the girls was just sooooo bad. The movie lost me immediately and that's very rare for me. No subtle introductions just in your face attitude and ridiculous antics. Pixar can do so much better. I guess there's a reason this was released straight to streaming because it would be a box office BOMB.","23 March 2022",1,18,35
"Turning Red","If someone falls in the selected audience they might enjoy this. The problem is I don't know what audience that is. It wasn't me. The animation is good but the style is a bit off, the characters are annoying, and the extra flares to some of the scenes are weird.","12 March 2022",1,43,100
"Turning Red","I thought it was a highly entertaining flick about growing up (both physically and emotionally). And I think it did a good job of touting the message of accepting your kids are growing up and need you less but also still saying to not let your kids grow up too fast, and it's important to not put too much pressure on them and let them just have fun sometimes. There for certain is also the metaphor for periods but honestly, I wouldn't really say that's the focus of the film. The message for this film really is targeted more towards the parents. Even though Mei is literally changing into a red panda - she basically remains unchanged inside. Albeit a bit more confident. It's the mother who really goes on a character arc.

I really liked Mei. I've seen a couple reviews that say she's annoying or obnoxious. But I honestly wasn't bothered in the slightest. She just felt like a typical awkward teen to me. And I thought friends were equally adorable too. I loved their relationship. And I really loved how the girls in the movie were portrayed in general. They could have easily thrown in ""mean popular girl"" trope and I'm glad they didn't.

I do take slight issue with the mother though. I don't necessarily mind the ""strict parent"" trope. But it sometimes borderline went into clueless category. There's one scene in particular where it's just like ""How do you honestly not see this as just an innocent crush""?

But overall it's such a fun movie. Great message. Great animation. The cooking scenes in particular looked sooooo good, they were making my mouth water. I'm sure it may also benefit that I was 12 in 2002 when this movie is set and so some nostalgia factor plays in. But, even if it was set today, set in a different part of the world...it would still be a great movie because the story is great.","13 March 2022",9,17,44
"Turning Red","Fascinating take on how violence that may have served in the past becomes irrelevant and harmful as time marches on.

My only issue was with how the symptoms of abuse are clearly shown and then glossed over as mother makes restitution with daughter.

I was surprised at the normalization of the abuse under the guise of cultural expectations and thought it was strange with so many other potentially controversial issues being addressed that they left such a glaring error.","20 March 2022",8,5,8
"Turning Red","This is Pixar's first major ""miss"" in the catalog for me. I suppose it's inevitable when you constantly churn out masterpiece after masterpiece, but BOY does this one ever fall flat.

The animation is really nice and smooth, the kind of thing you would come to expect from Pixar. The acting isn't too bad either, nor is the music. The problem with Turning Red lies in its writing, which is shallow as anything and provides a story that is geared more toward an older child audience.

When you're Pixar, your films have the benefit of appealing to all ages. Toddlers can watch a movie like Toy Story and enjoy the adventurous fun, and adults enjoy it too. This movie is, essentially, a coming-of-age story about a young girl dealing with the pubescent changes in her body.

A good message, and a kind of representation that SHOULD be out there... I just don't personally feel Pixar is the right company to be doing that. This movie doesn't feel like a Pixar movie, it feels like a bland, average middle-schooler comedy with some fantastic elements whipped in for good measure. It's like if Disney covered menstruation in one of their tv shows, going as far and as bold as the stations would broadcast, and then threw in some shapeshifting nonsense for good measure. The difference is, a film like this would be less jarring coming directly from Disney without the Pixar umbrella.

Pixar's unspoken motto, at least to me, was always ""less is more;"" they work on really good product and make each movie special, unique and entertaining. This movie is the first time that hasn't been followed.

It's boring. It's definitely towing the line between what is and isn't appropriate (especially for a Disney. Pixar film) and it just feels too derivative of everything else that's already out there. When your main character essentially turning into a monster every time she's worked up isn't enough to set your story apart from the hundreds of thousands of others... I don't know what to tell you, honestly.","9 June 2022",3,4,7
"Turning Red","I Had huge expectations (as usual) because, obviously...Pixar! But this movie fell flat. I lost interest after watching the first ten minutes.

Weak plot, annoying characters and very surprisingly poor animation. Pixar usually sets the highest standards when it comes to animation but there was nothing outstanding about turning red's animation. I felt like I was watching a poorly made animated commercial for a consumer brand

There's nothing memorable in the entire 1.4 Hr runtime. The dialogues felt like few kids having a banter on Twitter and being woke.

Every Pixar animation is heartfelt but this just felt like some new age nonsense. The movie lacks a soul.

Probably could be the worst from Pixar so far. Probably worse than Cars 2. Yeah! There... I said it.","11 March 2022",2,44,99
"Turning Red","Far too much energy gone into riding the wave of dare-to-be-different, message-driven statements than building a story and a world accessible to the greater breadth of Pixar's fan base. It appears the studio heads, under the pressure of a climate of diversity, have given too much artistic and narrative control to a team that are more passionate to put their personal stamp on a project than they are experienced in communicating rich, timeless entertainment; alienating all but those few whose personal experiences directly correlate.

Stunning visuals aside, the energy, style, structure, narrative and characters had zero access points for me at all. A film doesn't need to talk to me directly in order to relate an interesting story or journey, but at every step of the way it seemed that this latest Pixar offering, unlike every other before it, was simply 'not meant for me'. If that was intentional and it is designed purely for a much narrower target audience than expected, and considering the recent increase in studio output rate, I guess the new age of Pixar is one where we tread cautiously.","13 March 2022",3,15,31
"Turning Red","This movie is truly one of Pixar's best. The way the characters navigate the story is super relatable and I love how the topic of growing up is handled. Be prepared to fall in love.","11 March 2022",10,60,182
"Turning Red","As a parent of 4. This movie is not for kids especially under the age of 8. It teaches you that it's ok to go behind your parents back and do things you shouldn't be doing. Teaches you betrayal. Teaches you that your friends are more important then family. Teaches you it's ok to lie. Teaches you it's ok to hide secrets from your parents. Teaches you arrogance, it's ok to do whatever you want as a teenager. Lack of discipline, it's ok to be mad and be someone your not suppose to be to fit it. This movie is horrible. Disney what are you doing?!?!?","8 April 2022",1,15,23
"Turning Red","I won't go into detail on the plot, as there's nothing more to it than what you see on the trailers.

The good:
The panda looks really cute (best thing about the movie)Animation is top qualityToronto looks beautiful and it is pretty accurately depictedSome laughs

The bad:
Extremely predictable plot with no surprisesRecycled story (one of the subplots from Encanto was literally the same as the main one in this movie)Too many scenes that cause secondhand embarrassmentNo heartwarming scenes in the whole movie

All in all, I was pretty disappointed with the movie. It's unimaginative and from my point of view, one of Pixar's worst. The only memorable scenes are the ones that will make you cringe and look away in discomfort.

5/10.","13 March 2022",5,44,79
"Turning Red","I watched this with my 7yr old who loves just about anything including this one. But I was shocked at how much I didn't like this... I mean it's PIXAR. I don't think there is a PIXAR out there that I don't like, at least enough to endure watching a few times with the family.

At first I thought, well is this movie just for girls hitting puberty with overbearing mothers? Cuz it seems like that's the audience. Some of the things the mother says and does I think were over the top and almost to the point of being abusive.

After reading through others reviews I was glad to see I wasn't alone in my thoughts on this one. Very sad to say but I would skip this one, unless you have a daughter who is about to start the change of life and maybe you could use this movie to help you talk to her about it... but it would probably be way less painful and akward just to straight up talk to her about it.","11 April 2022",5,8,18
"Turning Red","Turning Red (2022) :
Movie Review -

Those who are aware of PIXAR's formulas for human-friendly, emotionally blended films with fictional ideas of animated characters need no further explanation of what to expect from Turning Red. We all know that these things are not possible in real life, but Pixar has managed to create that connection with viewers like nobody else. The formula is simple. You create fictional characters that are human or sometimes inhuman, like animals, magic worlds, or something, and then mix them with real human emotions to teach audiences something about relationships, bonding, and life. They've done it dozens of times in the last few decades, from Toy Story to UP to Coco, and each time they bring something new to the table. Isn't that too much? It's a humanly impossible job, but they make it possible with animated characters. Hands down. Turning Red adds another heart-tugging chapter in Pixar's glorious book, and everybody who has a good taste for cinema or knows about Pixar's quality work should not miss it.

Turning Red is an animated coming-of-age fantasy comedy drama about a 13-year-old girl named Melin, who turns into a giant red panda whenever she gets too excited. Eventually, she discovers the reason behind it, the curse, and tries to pass the time until the cure takes place. Within this period, she learns about life and the difference between childhood and adolescent phases. Turning Red has all the Pixar hallmarks, from friendship to a mother-daughter relationship to self-realization. When I say Pixar Trademark, I don't think I need to elaborate any further.

Despite the problematic plot, the film stays engaging due to its fun-filled world. It has comedy for all ages. From kids to teenagers to adults, everyone gets their dose of laughter, and you don't need to put your brain into it. Rather, it's quite funky and stylish too. There is music, there is a chill-filled, friendly atmosphere, humour, a family touch, there's drama, there are emotions, and there are good visuals too. The screenplay is tight, right under 90 minutes (excluding credits). Hence, it never looks boring. A couple of musical numbers by Ludwig Göransson will set your mood just right.

The voice cast has done a fine job. It was a slightly stressful job because the tenderness of a kid's voice and then converting it into a horrible yet cute furry panda definitely needed more effort. Rosalie Chiang, Sandra Oh, Ava Morse, Hyein Park, and Maitreyi Ramakrishnan have done well there. The characters are kid-friendly, but they do relate to adults too. If it weren't for those attractive VFX designs, this fictionally non-fiction world would have looked fake, but I'm glad to say that it is very charming.

What uplifts this coming-of-age-drama are those intelligently humourous dialogues. ""I am 13! Deal with it."" - The girl yells in anger, just like that, but it hits you so hard that as a parent you might feel awkward and humiliated at the same time. Domee Shi has done a commendable job in her debut. Being a girl and then a woman herself, she knows what kind of situations any girl of that age and any mother has to deal with. She puts the heart and soul in the right place and expands Pixar's long list of family-friendly educational dramas. As a whole, Turning Red is unmissable for Pixar fans, teenage girls, and mothers. Wait, who else is left then? Yet another triumph for the brand that never disappoints the audience. Have fun and cry too.

RATING - 7/10*","11 March 2022",7,40,131
"Turning Red","I get the premise and applaud them trying to tell the story of the changes that happen to girls .

But I found the characters annoying - and stereotypical - especially the girls parents/grand parents.

The bright Pastel colours everywhere - ugh

The humour was well...... in modern terms - woke - and first time I've used that word.

Cringe x 100%","11 March 2022",5,53,128
"Turning Red","It's disappointing to see how many low reviews there are with this movie, when it did such a great job connecting to those who have dealt with strict moms. I personally like how this movie is a little different from most Pixar films. With the animation being slightly related to anime, being more bold with the PG rating (side note: PG doesn't always mean your 8 year old is gonna understand everything the characters are saying), and overall having fun with the awkward preteen characters! I encourage everyone to have an open mind with this movie. Even if it's not your new favorite Pixar film, this movie did a fantastic job with connecting to those who can relate!","30 March 2022",10,7,9
"Turning Red","It's pixar trying to cross a bit with Wo-eke Anime, it's pitiful that pixar churns out what suits to a minority. Think where they started and the classics they have produced then watch this, watch it back to back with a Wall-e or a toy story (even 4)and then if you've already rated it you'll drop it by at least half.","12 March 2022",1,31,71
"Turning Red","Not all Asian moms are that obsessive, controlling, and abusive like Ming. Just want to put it out there before I start the review. Good animation and comedy. As an Asian, I have many things that I can relate to in the movie and that I can just laugh at myself. Animation quality is outstanding: colorful and trendy. Unnatural flow of story and set-up for characters are a little disappointing. Mother Ming is villainized more than it needs to be to the level of uncomfortableness.","15 March 2022",7,12,31
"Turning Red","Reading through the reviews, I see the obvious signs of an organized smear campaign. Somehow, a story has offended the Usual
Culture War Suspects. Don't enable them by ignoring this film.

That being said, Turning Red is relatively cute coming of age allegory tale with elements of Chinese myth and culture. Not the best Pixar, not the worst. Probably not for very small children who won't understand it, but tweens and teens will enjoy it and get it. Perhaps that's what the Naysayers are afraid of.","13 March 2022",7,13,30
"Turning Red","I was looking forward to this film, and it had some potential as and idea but what a waste of time. This movie was far more terrible then I could have imagines. Who is this film even for? It's too mature for kids, to childish for teens, to cringe for adults... Cringe from beginning to end, including the end credit scene. More than one fat-butt joke. More than one sanity-pads joke. More than one Chinese parents overfeed their kids joke. More than one overbearing mother joke... I'm so glad I saw this on streaming rather then a movie theater because I have the option to skip forward. And I used that option, a lot!

Mei is an unlikable main character. Her actions, behavior, way of expression and basically everything about her is annoying and selfish. As a coming of age story some is expected but she is just an awful person whos obvious actions are tiring to watch. The only interesting part of the movie was her mother, Ming, and a movie about her would have been more interesting than the whiny self-righteous tween we got.

Once wived and never again. This is one of those pixar films that will be banished to the back of the memory cabinet never to be seen again.

Skip this and watch something better.","22 November 2022",1,3,4
"Turning Red","Where to start? How did this concept get through. I have a feeling there a million other film ideas that could've made Pixar noticeable again.

It's been sooo many years since an original thought has come through the place. And I think I know why. John Lasseter left and anything and everything is getting approved as long as it fits Disney's politics.

This movie is ridiculous. Old animation in my opinion. I really haven't seen anything capturing since...oh it has been awhile.

Turns into a Red Panda when she's emotional...wow what a concept.

No wonder this came out on Disney + and not in theaters. It's terrible.

Give the next film graduate $3 million and I can bet you 100% they'd turn out something far better than this junk.

Pixar used to be the best in the industry! The absolute best! Now we get this. And all ""critics"" are raving about it because if you don't you might get canceled. No sorry. A movie that is terrible needs to realize it's terrible. Perhaps so they won't make the same mistake again.

Original concepts. New animation. Creativity. Thats what we'll pay to watch. Not this second draft of an idea.

Sorry. Not Oscar worthy and certainly not Pixar worthy. John Lasseter would've never let this happen.","14 March 2022",1,26,55
"Turning Red","The animation is actually fine, it's bright and colourful and smooth etc.

But the facial expressions and body movements are bizarre. The faces are.seemongly.inspired by meme culture and are almost screaming to be screen grabbed and memed.

Weird choice.

Story is also pretty dull. They've jazzed it up by trying to add in deeper meaning etc, ultimately it's a kid changing into something and the fun it brings... Teen Wolf did it better 35 years ago.","16 March 2022",6,8,18
"Turning Red","I enjoyed this. I think people will laugh. Teaches classic Disney lessons about honesty, family and working together. There's some really weird people going around saying this isn't for kids and they're very sad and immature.","12 March 2022",8,13,33
"Turning Red","I very much enjoy watching Japanese anime and found that it was incorporated into this movie. One of my favorites is ""My Neighbor Totoro."" I liked the story in ""Turning Red"" and laughed quite a bit. I really enjoyed this movie and recommend it to everyone. Some people don't like change and read one review that stated it was one of Pixar's worst which I found to be quite harsh. I recommend watching it, you don't like it - no harm, no foul. Some people take their reviews of movies a little too seriously.","14 March 2022",10,12,22
"Turning Red","'Turning Red (2022)' is Pixar's latest effort, one that has been - for lack of a better term - dumped on Disney+ despite its initial theatrical intentions (its credits state it was optimised for IMAX). The flick follows a young Chinese-Canadian girl who discovers that she turns into a red panda whenever she experiences a strong emotion. Will she be able to control her inner beast or will it consume her life? The central concept is, quite obviously, a metaphor for puberty; it is used to explore the concept of entering adulthood and becoming your own person, breaking free of the sometimes suffocating expectations placed upon you by your family in the process. More specifically, though, the concept is a metaphor for female puberty, something that isn't explored in media nearly as often as its male counterpart. That's primarily because of the unnecessarily taboo nature of one of its most obvious aspects: menstruation. Coming-of-age stories surrounding girls/ women usually avoid this aspect entirely, further contributing to the damaging alienation this fact of life receives by society at large. Why should we be ashamed to talk about something that half of the population experience? The answer, of course, is that we shouldn't. This feature makes no qualms about wearing its allegory on its sleeve, even explicitly featuring deodorant and (*clutches pearls*) sanitary pads, but those worried about seeing blood in their kids movies needn't fret; the real-life physical transformations that come with puberty are portrayed exclusively as magical alterations of state here. Instead, most of the piece focuses on the emotional turmoil these changes cause within the protagonist. However, it doesn't portray them as some sort of enemy. Instead, it accepts that they're a part of life and bring with them several wonderful things. In this way, the film is suitably nuanced and uplifting. The same can be said for the way in which it treats its central relationships. The picture is made by women for women and it's wonderful to see; it outright celebrates our mothers, grandmothers, aunties and daughters. It affords its female characters (and the bonds they share) every bit of depth they deserve. Though its overarching plot is somewhat predictable in its broadest strokes and its finale feels a bit too over-the-top for its own good, the flick remains remarkably consistent throughout. It's super stylish (you can really feel the influence of stuff like 'The Mitchells Vs The Machines (2021)' here), endlessly energetic and unashamedly 'girly', filled with shades of pink and talk of dreamy *NSYNC-esque boy bands. It's entirely comfortable in its own skin, proud of what it is and who it's for. It tells a familiar story in an unfamiliar way and, as such, is really refreshing. I can see this meaning a lot to a certain group of people and that makes me happy. It's a fun, friendly and visually stunning feature. It also hits its emotional beats with all the power you'd expect from something made by Pixar. 7/10.","15 March 2022",7,21,66
"Turning Red","I love this film. Made me cry a few times. Animation is peak. Don't listen to people who said that the animation is bad. Most people complain they want the old Pixar but it hasn't gone away lmao. Its still Pixar with all the emotions, an awesomely written story, peak animation. Will definitely watch this again and again. This film is for everyone and it will make you love yourself more. Watch this film. You will not regret it. This film is needed.","11 March 2022",10,35,78
"Turning Red","I am a true diehard Disney fan, but this film is not one my kids will be watching. It has a couple cute moments, but it mainly consisted of kids being obnoxious and selfish...along with telling multiple boldface lies to parents, very inappropriate twerking (doesn't matter if it's in panda form...it's still inappropriate for young kids), and the main character is very disrespectful to her mother towards the end of the movie. And this is my personal opinion, but talk of a girl getting her period for the first time and mom flinging maxi pads around in several scenes just doesn't work for me...there is a place for it, but not on Disney+ where it raises questions from kids that parents might not feel they need to be asking yet...all in all, it's just a major letdown. There are better and more positive ways to show coming of age. Disney can do better.","25 March 2022",1,14,31
"Turning Red","The story of a Chinese family living in Canada. A 13-year-old girl has a secret that turns her into a red panda in a family tradition. The characters are simple, just the girl's family and four friends. I also enjoyed the fusion of a traditional Chinese folk tale and a modern idol.","11 May 2022",5,3,5
"Turning Red","How is this movie being praised? They'll try to get your kids any way they can these days. Disney just keeps getting worse.they make parents out to be terrible. Encourage sneaking out and lying. Basically wanting to cut off any connection between kids and their parents.","13 March 2022",1,32,61
"Turning Red","Combining a personal story with a fanatical spin, proved to be flawed yet entertaining film throughout. The animation was gorgeous, allowing each character to be expressive in the most cartoonish and emotional ways possible. This is only accompanied by an endearing story that takes relatable aspects of life, and implements it into a world of bright colors and vibrant characters. The characters are also charming and attachable due to the relationships they bestow and how they are betrayed as real, yet animated, people. The film, however, is flawed in areas due to the uncomfortable situations that are presented, especially towards the third act, making the film feel awkward in places. The runtime is also longer than it needed to be, with much of it feeling as if it could have been cut out. Although the film does not carry as much of an emotional punch as other Pixar films, this movie proved to be an entertainingly pleasant film that may not be for everyone, but was endearing its overall attempt.","11 March 2022",7,13,34
"Turning Red","Maybe I expected too much out of this movie.. and maybe there was a reason this got a straight to streaming release. I thought the red panda was cute, but other than that, I was let down. This lacked the depth I have come to expect from Pixar. Maybe it was just too much for tween girls with not enough for the rest of us. I felt the friends were over the top and annoying/cringey. Maybe they were the epitome of the type of boy crazy girls that annoyed me in Jr High ... That could be what destroyed this for me. Ok for tweens, not so much for me!","14 March 2022",5,12,24
"Turning Red","The comparison between the main character turning into a panda and girls going through puberty is smart, and a lot of the family drama is well done and emotional. However the lead and many of the supporting characters are annoying. This is a film made for children and not adults, usually Pixar can do both.","13 March 2022",3,14,37
"Turning Red","This movie is highly inappropriate and not family friendly at all.

The character is very disobedient and disrespectful.

There was no need to have female cycles mentioned in a Disney/Pixar movie.

Disney/Pixar has become complete trash and is no longer a family friendly film company.

Oh and non-diabetics don't know what Dexcoms are but nice try trying to sympathize with diabetics.(eye roll)","15 March 2022",1,35,82
"Turning Red","I am of Asian descent and it was refreshing to see parts of my culture represented. But I could not get over the main character's annoying demeanor, voice and whining. I couldn't finish this movie and it was the first time I've ever done it with a Pixar movie.","9 April 2022",3,13,20
"Turning Red","I'm a huge Pixar fan but there was nothing redeeming about this movie. Bad story and too childish. Felt like some low budget animation studio put this together and not the great Pixar. Come on guys, you're better than this.","12 March 2022",3,16,37
"Turning Red","This is a tricky one for me. I find myself stuck in the nebulous space of not really getting much out of this movie because I can't relate to it but also desperately wanting studios to make more like this. The story of a young girl hitting puberty represented by her turning into a giant red panda is a bit... On the nose but there's this really wonderful message in here about embracing your body and not being ashamed of perfectly natural bodily functions. Obviously, we've had countless stories of maturity over the years but the vast vast VAST majority of them have been centered on the male perspective and male experience. Its refreshing to see this going at it from a different angle and eye opening for me to watch and wonder if this is what it's like for every girl out there having to watch a story about a boy's first crush/boner.

Again, LOVE that Disney/Pixar are tackling this material, that a studio powerhouse like that is doing this. Sincerely doubt this will stick with me, personally, for very long though. I imagine this falling into Big Hero 6 territory. A movie that's good, but mostly forgotten.","12 April 2022",7,4,8
"Turning Red","""Turning Red"" puts all its strength in the theme of breaking free from perfectionism. But for the main character to find her way of doing that through seemingly dishonoring her parents is a wrong message to promote to kids. This Pixar film (clearly aimed for a slightly older teen audience) deals with the experience of puberty through strange metaphors. I'm not gonna fail to mention the weird gyrating part in front of her mother...

Pixar has made way better films and this felt like quite the flop. Art style always adorable, but concept execution is disappointing.","17 March 2022",2,11,23
"Turning Red","The concept of the movie gave me some Miyazaki vibes, which is the main reason I decided to watch it in the first place.

The animation is awesome and the quickness of it added a level of humor. And I like that it was anime-influenced.

There were some good jokes here and there.

I like the character designs. Especially for the main character, it helped make her likable.

However, this movie was predictable and there were some seriously contrived scenes, such as the heart to heart she has with her dad and when she betrays her friends. And there were choices made that robbed the movie of any serious emotional impact. Like the ending.

The whole time I was watching it I was thinking, ""What if it had the tone and themes of Spirited Away and it was just significantly more depressing and dark? Or if it was even like My Neighbor Totoro, it could've been way more impactful.""

I also couldn't help but get the feeling I have seen something like this, but I can't remember exactly what I am referring to. And I don't think it did anything different. I just have a feeling. (Not a good thing to go off of but I can't help it.)","19 March 2022",6,7,16
"Turning Red","I have not laughed, cried and learned about myself at the same time since Inside Out. This is Pixar stuff at its best. So it is just a pity that such a quality did not make it into the cinemas.","13 March 2022",10,16,40

"Turning Red","My little girl absolutely hated it only after 15 minutes.

She told me it's rubbish and she would like to leave and see Paddington Bear instead.

As her wish is my command (only sometimes, when it's appropriate), we went to the cashier and asked her to exchange our Turning Red tickets with Paddington Bear which was going to start in less than an hour.","13 March 2022",1,27,66
"Turning Red","I like Pixar films normally, but I have found that the more recent films have lost that cross over appeal between adults, kids boys and girls through creating memorable characters and funny stories. I didn't mind this film, but I thought the main character was weak and the films wasn't funny. Even my 5 and 8 year old boys didn't laugh once. It appeared to be a film about the trauma a girl goes through when she gets her first period crossed with teen wolf. I appreciate that this is an important moment in a woman's life (periods not turning into a wolf) but boys will struggle to relate to this. Maybe it will help them to sympathise with changes a girl goes through, but all I gathered was that they liked the massive pandas. Also I don't really want to watch a film on Friday night about periods (sorry to be insensitive but I don't). I think Pixar need to put focus back on making good characters with good stories for both parents and children to enjoy. This is a film my kids and I are likely to forget.","12 March 2022",5,16,36
"Turning Red","Turning red has exactly what all Pixar fans want. Beautiful animation, great performances, a good message, and a short and sweet running time. Domee Shi clearly put her heart and soul into this project and it shows.","11 March 2022",7,21,61
"Turning Red","Some jokes were funny, but the story itself is horrible, and has lots of references that are not supposed to be for kids. This is one of the worst Disney's movies ever!","12 June 2022",5,5,10
"Turning Red","Just an all around boring movie. Maybe I wasn't the target audience but Turning Red seems to lack the charm of Pixar past. Even the style felt meh and lacked the charm Disney and Pixar are known for in their characters and animation.","12 March 2022",5,21,48
"Turning Red","Pixar what the heck have you done....this movie should be shown in a health class in like 6th grade what the heck is this...there is nothing redeemable about this movie it's hard to understand the message is it puberty is it terrible relationships with parents idk what the heck it is all I know is it touches on periods...such a strange concept.","12 March 2022",1,21,46
"Turning Red","The first act in my opinion was not really good. As I continued watching, seeing Mei become the Panda and learning more about the Mystical family powers is very interesting. The third act really surprised me and it is very enjoyable and heartfelt. The movie really got better after the lackluster beginning.","11 March 2022",9,25,58
"Turning Red","I was watching this and I thought it was just about a girl turning into a red panda, it wasn't till a half hour in that I realized what they were going at. I don't think I'll be watching it again any time soon.","13 March 2022",1,26,64
"Turning Red","Animation is amazing, the textures are incredibly realistic but it doesn't forget to exaggerate facial or body expressions, one of the best Pixar's work in animation.

The plot is simple and fun but it does the job, good comedy for all ages but it's true value goes beyond...

It's cool having Disney little by little defying taboos such as menstruation, there are reviews in this platform of parents complaining about it for some reason? As if it wasn't something that happens to every single girl in this world, it is also good for boys to learn about that and stop making a big deal about this kind of stuff.","12 March 2022",9,8,18
"Turning Red","This movie, while it may be cute for tweens (the story is just not something a younger kid should watch. They wouldn't understand some of it), was just terrible in story telling or plot. Surely, Pixar can come up with a better storyline than this drivel. I rated it a 4 because the animation is on par with Pixar, but the plot just falls flat. There are a billion other stories or fables or myths...that could have been drawn upon for better stories, but this...this is just a waste of time. Lets face it, anything that Disney or Pixar produces or makes these days is just not worth it.","5 April 2022",4,9,18
"Turning Red","The moral of the story, if you can call it that, is that friends are more important than family and you shouldn't listen to your parents.

Animation and voice acting are good. There's some humerous moments.","12 March 2022",3,19,47
"Turning Red","Loved how anime influenced it was but this is not my type of anime.

In Dragonball when Goku transforms into a beast at the sight of the moon, that giant monkey purposed of mass destruction is more my speed.

In all fairness this movie is not market for me. I'm not a Tween year old girl so a lot of the movie made me role my eyes, but about 30mins of it was pure anime influenced greatness which makes me see this movie in a different light.

Overall, it was fun. The Disney formula was a little on the weak side here, but it did tugs on the heart strings like it was supposed to.

Not bad, not bad at all.","12 March 2022",8,35,128
"Turning Red","Expectations are high when a new Pixar movie is released... and this fails to get snywhere near them. The level of craft, care and attention to detail just isn't there. The story, script and characters are heavy handed, cliched and trite - trying too hard to be meaningful and failing miserably. Most disappointing though was the animation. The modelling and movement of the characters was basic at best and the style elements were weak. As a movie, especially a Pixar one, it's just not up to standard and I'm wondering if straight to Disney+ is the new straight to DVD.","11 March 2022",1,74,163
"Turning Red","Movie about family, friends and accepting yourself
I enjoyed the idea of the movie its funny smart it's catching your mind from the first scene
I don't know why the low rate from people
The movie are deep and I like how the Asian culture are there in modern way
P.s the voice of Sandra oh are very touching she's amazing actress even her voice can make you feel her emotions.","21 March 2022",10,5,9
"Turning Red","The worst Pixar's movie ever. It looks like it was written and directed by worst intern Pixar ever had. And animated by the same intern.

0% story, 0% likable charters. 100% agenda and 100% of predictable cliches. Targeting only basic teenage girls.

In our group nobody cared about anything that was happening on the screen.

Do not waist you time, better go and watch some paint dry.","17 March 2022",2,12,25
"Turning Red","The previews looked cute, but it was pretty bad. I actually kept thinking the writer of this movie had some serious mom issues. I won't spoil it anymore, but I will tell you that this shows a lot of disrespect for parents and teaches kids know more than their parents.","12 March 2022",2,40,75
"Turning Red","I enjoyed the film however I do not agree with what the message behind it is. Pixar films normally go into topics that are for a wide range of audiences and I feel this was very narrow. It talks about a girl that disobeys her parents all together and gets away with it. This is not what we should be teaching to our children as they need to be taught to respect their parents rather than rebel against them.","26 March 2022",4,9,16
"Turning Red","I'm trying to figure out what movie those other people were watching. Main character is unfunny and uninteresting. The mother is a controlling psychopath.

After 15 minutes, I was too bored to continue. I *love* Pixar movies... but this fell flat. Worst of the Pixar movies by a *very* large margin.","17 May 2022",1,7,16
"Turning Red","Most Pixar movies (not sequels) are metaphors for bigger things. Or at least ask larger questions within a child's imagination.

But during this movie, I kept asking why does this exist?

The animation is good quality - but that's standard for Pixar and most animation studios in this era. But this movie feels like a extended episode of a Saturday morning cartoon for an acquired taste.

This is all visual with no substance.

Shame - Pixar used to set the benchmark.","13 March 2022",4,18,51
"Turning Red","Very good Disney and Pixar movie for me i find this movie decent i don't think it's the worst movie please pixar you included 4 town i love the songs when i first listened however the movie Without pandas would be boring but then this what i call a ultimate giga masterpiece from disney and Pixar.","11 March 2022",9,23,79
"Turning Red","I love a Disney film more than I'd care to admit but this is not aimed at me this is clearly targeted at teenage girls 13-15 in my opinion, as 31 year old man there is very little to enjoy in this.","13 March 2022",5,8,13

GROWING UP IS A BEAST.","13 March 2022",4,19,57
"Turning Red","Before you say ""they didn't get it"" this film isn't that deep, don't kid yourselves. Plot is predictable and what about Asian Stereotypes? My kids thought it was ok but they quickly moved back to Encanto. There usually want to watch every movie 1000 times and neither of them have asked to rewatch this yet. Honestly, this is kind of a mix between Freaky Friday and Teen Wolf. Sick of giving filmmakers a pass, original content has disappeared from Disney and pixar. Even some of the jokes are stolen from other films. This sucked.","20 March 2022",1,15,34
"Turning Red","Turning Red is a surprisingly divisive film. There are some that love the movie and praise the handling of difficult conversations. There are others who find the subject matter off-putting. Who is right and who is wrong? Honestly, I think that both have their valid arguments.

Seeing Mei discover the ability to cope with her problems through friendship was a message I loved. The connection with her friend group was honest, tender and sweet. The humor was unique and I genuinely laughed more than once.

While the animated panda was well done, I wasn't particularly impressed with the animation of the humans. Similarly, the voice acting was not anything special. I wanted to connect with the characters and love the story, but I left the film conflicted.

I thought that the core message of the film had some strong elements, but there were other pieces that I didn't completely agree with. That being said, the scene in the astral realm was gorgeous and one of my favorite animated moments of the year.

Best Character: 4*Town
Best Quote: ""People have all kinds of sides to them. And some sides are messy. The point isn't to push the bad stuff away. It's to make room for it, live with it."" - Jin
Best Scene: The astral (red panda) realm.","24 September 2022",5,1,1
"Turning Red","Its a fine film.

IDK. Interestingly, it focuses on an upcoming teen kid that defies what I think defines teenagedom which is conformity whilst finding yourself.

Firstly, I think this is definitely not made for an older male audiences. Its biggest strength is that it sticks to its gun and really push for its female viewpoint.

Its very interesting how this is verily hated by a lot of clearly male reviewers. I found its depiction of this female relationship especially friend-wise very well made. The boy-craziness and quirkiness that it hurts attitude is an actual thing.

Oddly, I hate how the film handled the symbolism of the titular Red Panda. Its started as symbol of growing up or some inner self to be left behind BUT I do not know what happened in the end. Its like the inverse Kiki's Delivery experience. Staying to your inner child regardless AND commodify it. The way they handled after the concert ticket ploy portion is just confounding. Does it even really matter? The inner beast apparently, it did not stick well.

Then the parental relationship. Its a very tricky path that they went for. The film posits that you should be you regardless of others, which is okay BUT is it? The one dimensional stereotypic depiction of Chinese mothers did not really made a good case for me.

Overall, Turning RED is a confounding mess that does not go in too deep. This is something that feels very unfamiliar for the context laden Pixar film of the past but is a fun watch anyways for teenage female kids. Not my cup of tea [2/5]","13 March 2022",4,15,44
"Turning Red","Main character is rewarded for being totally disrespectful and selfish, lying, sneaking, and disobeying. I suppose the writers and Disney/Pixar were cool with that though, because she's living ""her truth"".

Terrible movie. Completely inappropriate for kids under 13.","13 March 2022",1,30,59
"Turning Red","I have so many things to say so I'll keep it very brief. There's so many pros I found in this movie. I appreciate the feminism, Pixar's bravery towards menstruation, the all female cast, the jokes, the cultural references. I mean this movie just takes Disney's norms and flip them on their head. It's unique and takes inspiration from anime like Sailor Moon and FruitBasket. It's concept is new, finally a fresh idea from Pixar/Disney. It's realistic yet mythical and surreal. The animation is simply stunning and the art style is something not regularly seen in cartoons. All of the characters have their assigned personality and it works. And oh my gosh did i mention the soundtrack???? Godsend. Call me dramatic. Voice actress for Mei is very impressive, she's great and I love her! The movie is not only visually stunning but all-in-all amazing as well. Definitely worth the watch!","1 April 2022",10,5,9
"Turning Red","This movie did not feel like a Pixar movie whatsoever. The animation looked cheap the story was awkward. Honestly I thought I was watching a cheap looking Netflix cartoon and not look anything even close to what Pixar usually does. Overall pass on this movie you won't be missing anything.","12 March 2022",2,19,44
"Turning Red","What Turning Red did was shine a spotlight on the worlds short comings when it comes to girls 'coming of age' the exploitation of children going through puberty, fake, autotune models singing provocatively to make young girls & boys buy into what ever trash they pump out, it's a sad shame this was done to put the exploitation in positive light.","16 March 2022",3,12,31
"Turning Red","The story is okay but fails to be very, very on the nose in giving everything away in dialog. Like the animation it fails subtilty making the end result crude and a far cry from Pixar of old days.

The animation is fine, the character models aren't and the whole thing is very mediocre at best. The core demographic is pre-teen, that is finest Pixar movies have layers for all layers, something that this product fails to deliver on.","12 March 2022",3,14,33
"Turning Red","It honestly doesn't go anywhere. Such a waste of time.

Poor script, dialog, jokes...
I'm a fun of just about any Pixar film, not sure what happened there.","14 March 2022",3,16,27
"Turning Red","There were a few laughs but I honestly found it to be bleh and cringey. Pixar has dropped the ball and the my body my choice reference is shameful for a child's movie.","12 March 2022",1,33,68
"Turning Red","I now understand why they decided to not put this in the theaters, it's because it does not live up to what you would expect from a Pixar movie. It started off promising but went downhill from there. Almost had to explain to my 9 year old son what a period was. I also found it strange how it basically was teaching young kids to defy their parents.","12 March 2022",3,15,33
"Turning Red","This IS without a doubt the worst Pixar movie ever released; annoying characters, ""comedy"" that makes you uncomfortable, plot is all over the place, bad message, and (for Pixar's standard) bad animation. I wanted to like it so bad expecting it to be better than the trailers made it seem but no, it's even worse than the trailers. One thing I did like was the cooking scene.","8 April 2022",1,9,16
"Turning Red","Best Pixar movies that make you self reflect and can relate to are Turning Red, Inside Out and Lion King.

People don't like this movie because it's a thinking, self development and self reflection movie. Not all movies should be obnoxious for you to feel entertained, sometimes you need a rare gem like Turning Red, Inside out and Lion King to make you just reflect.

Anyways...Let's read my review of what I have to say about this film.

About: A Chinese girl from the T. O, 6, T.dot, aka Toronto that has to deal with her strict overbearing, ignorant mom. At 13, she becomes a Red Panda due to a spiritual historical curse within her family, this time it's not to fight the big 3 known as ""aliens, androids, and wizards."" She is fighting her inner self and her mom because she is overbearing and mean.

Story and Production: Like Inside Out movie, this movie is an original. It lacks clichés, dumb tropes, obnoxious story, characters and production.

The animation is neat. I like it. It stood out a lot.

I like how this movie takes place in Toronto. I was expecting a clichéd up movie, instead I got Inside Out 1.4. Which is good. I liked this movie because it allowed self reflection, thought, and you can relate to the characters.

As I'm watching this movie it reminded me of Inside Out and what did I discover the director also worked on Inside Out. What are the odds of that.

Highlight: Panda Vs Panda fight.

Main intelligence: 8

Unworthiness level: 4. They really emasculated the dad for a cheap cricket laugh. The wife probably only married him because she can control him. (This review might get censored for mentioning this), but the truth is the women in this were empowered while the dad, Cashier boy and Tyler were humiliated.

Should you watch this? Yes. If you enjoyed Inside Out and can relate to that, then this movie can make you do the same.

If you have an overbearing parent, you can relate to the main character and her mom.

The Panda probably symbolizes isolation because so-called Pandas are endangered. The Main girl though grasped by her mom with a tight grip, still felt isolated. Red symbolizes rage. The main girl subconsciously knew her mom was overbearing and did not like it yet was upset about it. Anytime the main girl raged as the panda she looked like she became the Red-Hulk meaning she really hated how her mom treated her and couldn't express herself to her but was able to let it out towards others as a coping mechanism.

Great animation, symbolism and a reflection movie. Also, the Skydome made a cameo in this film.

Please watch this.","31 July 2022",10,3,6
"Turning Red","It's aimed at pre-teen & teenagers. Yet it appears to be a cartoon for younger kids that don't need to hear teenage coming of age dialogue. Had the start of something but it was poorly advertised to be a family movie. Should be a PG-13 rating.","20 March 2022",1,13,25
"Turning Red","This us so annoyingly cringe i cant understand what was going through their midn when they were making this movie.. Why they had to make that mother act like the worst b...................................","13 March 2022",1,17,37
"Turning Red","One of the things I find annoying about the recent trend in animation is substituting humor with constant screaming and hysterics. Pixar has fallen prey here with Turning Red. In what could have been a meaningful and interesting story to tell, across any cultural background, is the relationship between mothers and daughters and the unintentional burdens we place on kids (who just want to be kids). Instead we're given a bit of shallow, two-dimensional characters that checkmark all the usual boxes: Asian tiger mom (check), quirky friends who are quirky for the sake of being quirky (check), boys or men who are inexplicably mean/dumb/dreamy with no background story (check). Lastly, I found the animation looked rather rudimentary and plasticky.

Some of the more physical comedy was pretty clever and entertaining. But all in all, Turning Red will not be remembered in the Pantheon of Pixar greats.","12 March 2022",5,12,27
"Turning Red","Maybe there is just something about me, but I wasn't very entertained or emotionally moved by this movie. Sure I wasn't the target demographic. I'm not a teen of female or Asian or from Canada like the main character. I did however live through the early 2000s at about the same age of the main character. I can recall what girls around my age were like around middle school and was familiar with feeling like my parents didn't understand my needs as a teenager like most teenagers in the digital, but pre-smartphone era. And I did feel live with being held to higher educational standards than others kids my age around the early 2000s. The movie 8th Grade seemed to offer a better look at an option for how to take the coming of age experience as a drama. And something like Inside Out offered some good sequences for how that kind of story could be handled at times comedically. I just didn't feel like the changes in drama and comedy were natural for the story. They just felt forced as a desperate attempt to keep the viewer attentive, and interested from moment to moment.

The animation and voice acting were nothing to write home about positively or negatively. Overall the story and style seemed to be trying to be too much. And didn't get me to laugh appreciatively about it And not in a clever allegorical way. But in a bash you over the head kind of way. Hopefully 2023 will be a better year for Pixar than 2022.","7 November 2022",4,2,3
"Turning Red","Pixar movies used to be full of of emotions happiness, sadness, kindness. A heartfelt story and likeable characters, and most of all memorable.

Turning Red has none of this, it's a dull lifeless bore. I'm not sure who the target audience is, it certainly isn't children (talks of periods and gyrating), it isn't adults as there's no depth to the story, it's all superficial. The characters are forgettable, I don't recall a single name, and they're unlikeable. The voice acting is poor to very poor. The animation looks like it was done by trainees and the art style is odd. The music, it's the same one song played throughout the movie, don't recall what it was or what is was about.

There's a reason why this is released on Disney+ included in the subscription and not in cinemas / or chargeable.","12 March 2022",2,21,45
"Turning Red","The story made sense but it was kinda dumb as hell. Tbh I just really didn't like it. Other people might, but personally I think is was pretty stupid. Plus the characters are super annoying.","14 March 2022",4,20,40
"Turning Red","This movie was literally amazing and funny. It's also heart warming to enjoy a new Disney classic animation from Pixar's Animation Studios. This cartoon deserves to be seen and to enjoy a very good laugh for the whole family.","14 March 2022",10,13,41
"Turning Red","Just dont watch it. It is a bad movie that teaches bad thought processes. PG 13 should be flagged as it teaches a lot of wrong actions. Stay away if your expecting a Toy Story.","13 March 2022",1,22,46
"Turning Red","This movie reminded me a lot of Bigmouth and Derry girls. Both are very well written teen focused shows that have a wide audience appeal. This movie is a look at the time is a girls life when she becomes something new. Either a woman or a panda?. Being different is hard, it opens you to a lot of criticism and even in the time this is set I think in the early noughties. The level of social stigma and angst was just as much as today. We really enjoyed the movie, it was different enough to entertain but we went away with something to contemplate. Thankyou.","12 March 2022",9,7,15

"Turning Red","Our family was excited to watch this. We couldn't even get through it. I can't figure out who their true intended audience was because it missed the mark on a lot of levels. Such a shame because we wanted to love it!","14 March 2022",1,19,44
"Turning Red","I feel like this movie totally misses the mark. It's loud, annoying and fairly pointless. I feel like the issues the main character had with her mother weren't referred at ALL- none of us could figure out why she was rebelling. Against what? A mother who cares for her daughter and looks after her? So what if she was a little embarrassing, like... Nothing was portrayed well enough for any of us to actually care about any ""conflict"" within the movie. Didn't really like it at all.","11 March 2022",2,27,67
"Turning Red","Perfect animation and visuals but the story is so bad, superficial and weak. It isn't built on anything and moves too fast. Not worth your time to be honest.","11 March 2022",4,37,83
"Turning Red","The 2 things that made me wanna rewatch this movie, they ran the show. I love these two characters and the actresses! I feel they brought too much anime into it and focused more of facial expression than the actual point of the movie. Which yea art is important but I feel they're taking the art more serious than the storyline. Kind of predictable.","14 March 2022",7,4,8
"Turning Red","I'll begin by saying I'm not the target market for this movie, so wasn't expecting to enjoy it much myself.

However, my children really didn't like it, and two of them are 13 & 14 yr old girls.

The animation is incredible, but the story and overall feel is very cringey and nobody in my house enjoyed it and we're HUGE Pixar fans. Real shame.","12 March 2022",2,14,33
"Turning Red","I struggle with the fact that Pixar made this movie. I have associated Pixar movies with fun family movies. That has changed. It's not graphic but the fact that the main character howls, salivates, works up a vivid sweat over a boy (while drawing pictures, which they left up to the imagination) is disturbing to say the least. I wouldn't want my son or daughter to behave that way or be influenced by this movie. My kids love red pandas so I thought I would check this movie out with them. Turned it off and told my kids this wasn't a good movie for them to watch. I implore parents to watch this movie beforehand so you can make an informed decision about whether or not you let your children watch this movie.","12 March 2022",1,27,61
"Turning Red","Great animation on this movie, next to Spiderverse the animation here has been my favourite. Also a wonderful story, but then again, any story that has a red Panda in it has got to be good🙂 , This is a story about finding yourself, being yourself, a message all of can be reminded of cause being yourself can be tough.","12 March 2022",9,12,33
"Turning Red","I'm a huge fan of Pixar. I honestly thought Coco should have been nominated for and should have won best picture. But this movie feels like they began with an outline then filled things in whether or not they made sense. Cliches and stereotypes throughout. But it really didn't work at all for me.","24 March 2022",5,8,20
"Turning Red","I'm not gonna lie, I was a little worried about this movie when I saw the first trailer but I was pleasantly surprised. This movie is a metaphorical masterpiece disguised with comedy, heart and relatability. I was laughing out loud within the first five minutes of the movie and heavily invested from the start. I hope everyone sees this movie and enjoys it the way I did! As much as I loved being able to watch this at home right away, I think it would've been a major success to see in theaters! Disney/ Pixar hit it out of the park (again) with Turning Red!","12 March 2022",9,9,22
"Turning Red","There are lot of comments regarding the message it gives kids but I'd be more annoyed with the parenting skills! Let's ignore the so-called ""messages"" and concentrate on the film itself, as it's not good. The radio advertisement for this movie has bombarded us for weeks and it really didn't sound great but we gave it a chance. ""It's a Pixar! It'll be great!"" It's not. The story isn't appealing and it can even get annoying! Imagine a modern, animated renewal of Teenwolf, and imagine a really bad version of that, and you'd still be pushed to imagine it being so bad!

Genuinely gave it a chance. We wanted to quit but went on to the end. It really didn't deserve our perseverance.","13 March 2022",2,14,34
"Turning Red","It is probably a fine movie if it speaks to you, but it has a very specific audience. That audience being women who rebelled against their mother's cultural norms to go their own way.

It just had nothing for myself, I was bored and stuck it out for my kids. Thankfully I had my phone for entertainment.","12 March 2022",4,11,27
"Turning Red","Turning Red is a Pixar animated movie direct to streaming on Disney+. The plot is about a young Korean girl living in Cañada whose family runs a small business tourist destination museum. Mei Lei voiced by Rosalie Chiang is a focused, confident, dorky kid who turns into a red panda whenever she gets excited. Her overprotective mother voiced by Sandra Oh is an overbearing mother who is never too far from her child. This is a good family oriented flick with great animation that looks real but not something that would be watched again. I would compare this to Teen Wolf, much of the same concept.","14 March 2022",6,12,38
"Turning Red","Unfortunately, although the idea was interesting, it became predictable shortly and you started to wait for the end. The graphics were sloppy at some points, looked cheap, really not Pixar's style. Too overrated and overappreciated. PS, idk if their attitude helps the girl team, just saying, i don't think girls at that age do that, so showing.","1 April 2022",7,3,6

"Turning Red","Pixar usually tends to make their films to a more broader audience, but this film narrows down to a small portion of that audience, which I'm not a part of.

Disney is pushing their luck.","12 March 2022",1,37,83

I never write reviews but this movie is the absolute worst I can't believe I bothered with this!!!","13 March 2022",1,23,47
"Turning Red","This movie feels different than any other Pixar movie I've seen. And that's not necessarily a bad thing to try something different. But it's definitely aimed at an older audience than others. I can't see a 5-year-old liking this one as much as, say, Monsters Inc. The problem is that the best Pixar movies don't just entertain you but make you feel something. And this one just doesn't do that.","3 May 2022",6,2,3
"Turning Red","It is shocking this film was made by women. The only reason for 2* is the quality of the animation. The female characters are depicted as overbearing, narcissistic, neurotics who all have significant relationship issues. The only male characters came across as downtrodden or untrustworthy. The story is poor and done in a manner which suggests the main character must sell herself in order to afford to see a pop group. This is not a film to inspire young ladies and tell the message of what is a natural phase of life, but how that time of the month will turn you into an unpredictable animal.","12 March 2022",2,19,43
"Turning Red","I am not a parent but I cannot imagine trying to watch this with a child. The lessons in this movie are absolutely not appropriate and it should not be up to a movie studio to try and teach children when and how to rebel.

There are no consequences for the main character and wouldn't you know it the child is the one who knows best in the end. The adults even blame and yell at the children at one point in a scene I found VERY inappropriate. Way to blatantly disregard the family structure and parental authority.

Not. A. Fan.","18 March 2022",1,16,36

"Turning Red","Turning Red is fun. The story of a girl understanding her new ability to transform is playful, while also working as a metaphor for the growing pains of becoming independent. This message isn't groundbreaking, but its framing compensates. Plus, dialogue is witty, characters are relatable, and emotions feel earned. Therefore, any plot shortcomings are overshadowed by a passionate tone and careful details. Furthermore, the voice acting provides concrete enthusiasm, guiding audiences through the journey. Overall, Turning Red puts a perky spin on a reliable narrative while also conveying ample spirit, making it an easy event to buy into.

Technically, Turning Red is everything viewers expect and more. The effects and designs are recognizably Pixar, with added anime flair. Turning Red channels the exaggerated eyes, movements, and dramatics of the beloved artform, creating a uniquely informed experience. The cinematography pays homage with energized camerawork, surreal colors, and symbolic representations. Also, editing is dynamic, sound is abstract, and music is culturally fitting (with a bonus pop song). Meanwhile, the direction unifies this excitement with a heartwarming mood, matching style with substance. Altogether, Turning Red isn't Pixar's deepest film, but it has a strong message and a stronger delivery.

"Turning Red","I couldn't even go past maybe 10 minutes of this. Animation has stopped being for children or pretty much anyone who isn't drinking the pc Koolaid. I'm over it. I haven't watched any of these Disney or Pixar animated films in years because of it. In basically the first 10 minutes the little girl is encouraging rebelling against your parents. Don't let her first few sentences fool ya, this movie is not for kids. If you care about what shapes your children's beliefs I would suggest avoiding this. Also, parents really should check out these animated things first to see if it's suitable for them.","27 March 2022",,7,18
"Turning Red","I cried watching this movie because I learned Pixar lost their magic. This movie is about rebellion. Teaching kids to disobey your parents, and that children know better. It introduces the concept to children that they are better off making their own choices without your parents. When children entertainment isolates children from their parents and family they are trying to indoctrinate them with something different then their families values.","13 March 2022",1,20,52
"Turning Red","I really enjoyed this movie! Found it very relatable to myself when I was a young girl going through puberty trying to figure everything out. Parents reading my notebooks and all. That being said I hate how some reviews are hating on it for them not finding it relatable. You can enjoy a story without having any ties to it. Do I relate to other Disney movies like Cars or Monsters Inc? Hell no but I still enjoyed the ride.","15 March 2022",8,3,4
"Turning Red","First, I want to say that I love Disney and Pixar. They are both fantastic animation studios and Turning Red (2022) reminds me how fantastic they are.

I liked Rosalie Chiang as Meilin Lee and her personality as a regular teenage girl who is trying to get used to teenage girl problems and liking boy bands along with her Red Panda situation. You can relate to her and would feel the same emotions if you were in a weird problem like this.

The animation is still great with a different animation style compared to their other animated movies. When she turns into the Red Panda it moves so smoothly and the detail in the fur of the Red Panda made it look soft and fluffy.

I like the premise and I like how they made an original boy band called 4*Town for the movie, along with original catchy songs they wrote for them to sing and for the characters to sing along to.

People will relate to the main character, the animation is fantastic, the voice acting is good, and there are 3 catchy songs. I recommend giving this a watch if you are interested or if you love Disney and Pixar.","12 March 2022",7,19,75
"Turning Red","Important Initial Note: Parents with prepubescent female children, beware that they might be exposed to really weird or harsh realities that Domee Shi forgets might be a lot for a kid (refer to 3rd and 4th points).

Pixar's bar is held high when it comes to films... even worse, it falls below the general standards of a film.

As a Pixar film, with a reputation of 8, 9, and even 10 star films (like Toy Story, Wall-E and The Incredibles), Pixar automatically sets the expectation that they will put as much effort into their next films as they did in their predecessors. That is simply not the case with Turning Red (or many of their other recent films).

First off, the film chooses to tackle a story (which has lots of potential) by hitting it head on. When dealing with such a powerful story, filmmakers should use discretion to portray their message, metaphorical storytelling. This allows the message to apply to all audience members (not just women in this instance). The main message being the beginning of menstruation. Other messages could be received, such as ""finding your voice,"" but was ultimately buried in the onslaught of her containing the incoming ""panda."" Like the phrase ""my panda, my body""? Come on, you gotta be more creative than that.

Secondly, for the side message of her ""coming of age"" and ""finding her voice,"" it gives a generally good message, where it seems like she tries to find a respectful balance with obeying and rebelling, but ultimately comes off as straight rebellious, with obeying your parents as a negative consequence of being their child. First they say ""she's brainwashed"" for helping upkeep her family's business, then she completely goes behind their back for the rest of the film. It's a huge honor and responsibility to help your family carry on a legacy and to keep care of family property and that's never properly encouraged in this film. While you should look to voice your opinion and choose your own path once you become an adult, there is nothing wrong with a child being raised on certain path till they can find their own footing... and turning 13 does not mean you're old enough to make those decisions (as she, and what is generally encouraged by the film, skips out on responsibilities to go solicit for money so she can see a boy band, lying to her family in the process). Not to mention at the end the two are scared Mei's life choices will cause them to be separated, and her mother says ""the further you go, the prouder I will be"", almost as a fantasy of what the writer wishes her mother had said to her... encouraging her to get as far away from tradition as possible, instead of keeping any good values and improving on them.

Thirdly, with this topic it is important to approach it delicately. It seems Domee Shi forgets that this is a lot of information for a child to take in (even though that's literally what the main issue Mei faces is), because she proceeds to push unnerving and blunt messages like ""do you need pads"" or preventing ""accidents,"" as well as instances where when her friends find out they say ""we still like you panda and all"" referring to her period, then when she turns back human they say ""you're you again!"" as if she turns into a different person/a.k.a. The hideous monster she's afraid of being, whenever she goes into panda mode (starts to menstruate). Basically implying that she is to be feared whenever she is emotional... the stereotype you'd expect them to avoid, but no.

Fourth, Domee Shi makes some really weird decisions (or maybe I just don't understand) by having them make money off of her ""panda mode."" Honestly this pushed me totally south when it came to my impression on the film, because if the panda is supposed to be her ""female time,"" then why are they filming it, taking pictures with it (what they call ""Panda Pics""), and soliciting it? It's really off-putting and ultimately turns me completely away.

Fifth and finally, some content, such as a moment when Mei begins to discover her relational (and presumably sexual) feelings and draws off-screen racy content in her notebook, might give some viewers pre-exposure to feelings of sexuality or even curiosity about pornography; things parents usually want to educate their own children on, or avoid their children seeing prematurely if no interest has spiked yet.

Now for the summery.

Pros: Fairly well animated film with potential to have powerful messages.

Cons: Horribly executed story, poorly presented themes (even sickening at times depending on how you interpret their solicitation of her ""panda mode""), aggressive agenda that pushes away anyone outside of the exact category and even anyone who fits in it due to its overwhelming content (specifically on younger viewers who don't even know what a period is and might scare them), generally un-relatable/un-likable characters (from my own analysis, other users, and other viewers) who are 2-dimentional, a complete change from the previous vibe of Pixar films, and overall poor morals.","6 June 2022",2,4,8
"Turning Red","I knew nothing about this film going into it. If I did, I wouldn't have tried watching it. It's clearly aimed at young girls... which is great if you're a young girl.

Themes aside, I didn't find it funny or entertaining. The whole boy band music stuff is stomach churning. But again, I'm not a young girl.

Also, the girl's mother...wow. She's such an unlikable character. I couldn't stand her. I kept hoping the daughter would change into the panda and maul her.","18 March 2022",1,12,30

"Turning Red","This is a terrible movie. One of the worst movies for kids I've seen. It has no identity, no theme, terrible plot and story, it tries to be canadian but there is no alignment or resemblance of canadian culture. Its very confusing because its based in toronto but seems its based on chinese culture? Its just weird and confusing and it simply makes no sense. Tries very hard to virtue signal and is layerd with political messaging that you pick up on throughout. Has a girls only vibe rather than unity and clearly makes an effort for a girls only audience . And thats something even my 7 year old daughter picked up on which speaks to the foolish approach by the creators. Just awful and a major fail.","13 March 2022",1,32,73

"Turning Red","Ride into puberty, a young chinese ancestried girl who wants to make things on her own, even though her mother thinks shes a lame pussycat, and appears to be for some reason overprotective towards her daughter. There will be heavy consequences whatever and whenever...

its an animated coming of age stunt, made mostly for the girlish audience, even though the grumpy old man chuckled here and there.the plot and story are straight outta disney pixar, its tons of girlish chit chat, and you may look forever to find anything new on the animation front in this flick.

But its a neat editin of a puppae turning into a butterfly or a red panda in this story. Its a fair recommend for the whole family.","14 March 2022",7,17,69
"Turning Red","Political nonsense infused garbage with extreme overkill funding. Pixar has lost it.

Ya lets make a movie about Canadian.. I mean Chinese because they funded this garbage. Lets intentionally make modern stereotypes of young girls in the west as cringy as possible to support out Chinese propaganda of superiority.

"Turning Red","I don't know why this movie was made by Pixar.

They are known for making creative, thoughtful movies that can be enjoyed by anyone. This movie has a very specific audience, and there is absolutely nothing interesting about it. It's a very generic and in-your-face coming of age story that utilizes an animation style that is overdone these days. This was the first Pixar movie that I legitimately felt disconnected by, and could tell in the first 15 minutes that I wasn't going to like it.

My wife and I watched Wall-E a couple of weeks later, and I was reminded why Pixar is such an amazing studio. I hope they can return to form and start making movies with depth again.","3 April 2022",5,6,11

"Turning Red","And everyone knows it's true. Some ppl pretend because they don't want to admit to themselves how bad Pixar got, but deep down they know the truth. This is subpar on all levels. Why do you think Disney dumped it on Disney +? You really think they're going to bypass all the movie theater money if the movie was actually watchable? Here's proof turning red was stinky: I GUARANTEE you they will NOT dump Lightyear on Disney+. If they do, they maybe I'm wrong about turning red. But I'm not. And even the ones pretending to like it know I'm right and you're wrong.","26 March 2022",1,11,23
"Turning Red","Overall, meh. Not really controversial but definitely shares some values that won't be appreciated by all parents. I wouldn't want a young kid watching this for fear of getting a dose of early rebellious teenager. Has some liberal view points (definitely didn't like the ""my body, my choice"" jab that a 13-year-old makes at her mother that gets no repercussions).

Definitely for a niche audience though. Awkward middle schoolers who want to see they're not alone in awkwardness and anyone above that age that wants to relive their awkward pre-teen/early teen years may enjoy this.

It also had a similar lesson about family and expectations of perfection as Encanto, but I honestly think this movie did a better job resolving differences and being a loving family.","28 March 2022",4,7,13
"Turning Red","Turning Red (2022) is a movie I recently watched with my daughter on Disney+. The storyline follows a young lady who feels on top of the world until she starts going through some pre-teen changes that includes a family curse. The little girl, her friends and family try keeping the family curse a secret but it's going to be hard to keep under wraps.

This movie is directed by Domee Shi in her directorial debut and includes the voices of Rosalie Chiang (Soiled), Sandra Oh (Killing Eve), Ava Morse (Ron's Gone Wrong), Tristan Allerick Chen (WandaVision) and Orion Lee (Skyfall).

The storyline for this is pretty clever and very smart. It is a unique coming of age tale and depiction of life's changes as you go through your teenage years. The friends in this were great characters and the elder's were funny. This also depicts mother/daughter relationships well at multiple levels. The animation and soundtrack are both really good also. My only complaint would be the ending with the mother at the concert wasn't that great.

Overall this is a worthwhile addition to the anime genre and is a good movie to watch as a family and talk with your children about afterwards. I would score this a 7/10 and strongly recommend seeing it.","16 March 2022",7,13,52
"Turning Red","Once I watched Soul, I had high hopes that Pixar would make decent movies once again. Boy was I wrong.

I was expecting something intriguing like Pixar's Up or Incredibles,
but all I got was a horribly written teen-drama piece for a limited audience. Not for people for the likes of me.

I felt uncomfortable by the whole concept, there is nothing original. It felt like watching Cuties all over again. Oh so she transforms into a panda whenever Mei is excited, anxious or angry. How original. Not.

Seeing a girl rebel against traditions, hate her relatives, and show her panda off to people is not even enthralling as a narrative. The same old cliches.

Also why was Mei twerking in front of her mother? What did that accomplish in this movie?

Not only did the narrative suck, but the animation was ugly. It felt like watching an expensive Cartoon Network project.

Who storyboarded this?

How did this get approved? Why was this greenlit?

Everything, the animation, the dialogue, the story and themes are preposterous for a wide audience.","18 March 2022",2,7,15
"Turning Red","I had to create an account on how sad and disappointing Pixar and Disney has become, This movie plays with spirirual things not many people understand. If you love your child, Please avoid.","12 March 2022",1,26,57
"Turning Red","This film is not typical Pixar movie, it is more than that because of its unique themes and messages for young females. It is an achievement in itself, highly recommended this film!","11 March 2022",10,22,55
"Turning Red","Some funny moments but East meets West movies leave me feeling tired. As someone from the Asian community this movie feels.like a siblimenal message. I felt like I had been preached to by the end credits.","12 March 2022",3,8,18
"Turning Red","I think some of it is relatable- strict parents and girls wanting to break free from that, but in todays day n age honestly theres a lot of groomers out there waiting to for young girls to ""break free"" and 13 is just too young to become what 13 y/os are becoming. I dont think this helps.

I get the message about parents with no boundries and who are strict, and I think there is an age to break free from that... 13 just isnt it. 16-18 maybe but 13 y/os are just too naive. I think the message was twisted.","13 March 2022",2,16,37
"Turning Red","I love Disney, I do and the animation is really clean and very cute but as an Asian particularly a Chinese I felt slightly offended by how Disney portrayed that certain religion and our culture. It is a little too stereotypical and ridiculous, especially in the ritual scene, it's quite offensive actually. As a Chinese person whose religion and culture are portrayed strongly in that movie, I feel really ridiculed.","17 March 2022",1,12,22

"Turning Red","Watched this stuff for 20 minutes and turned red!!!....and then couldn't watch it no more. So lame and cringey! Every character overplays it! My advice - stay away from it and keep your children away! Particularly your daughters!","20 March 2022",1,8,16
"Turning Red","It seems like new Pixar movies and I have a disconnect. But I still enjoyed the movie. There wasn't simply an imagination rampant enough to bring the necessary visuals to fruition.

A mere 90 years ago, my grandfather was born. He had a harsher life than mine. Though he didn't have any instinct worth bringing over here, his existence paved the way for his grandsons to connect to the internet, and watch movies and share opinions of them. You get the picture. My gramps could have gotten luckier if he had been born in the late 70s.

All of this type of musing is absent from Turning Red. The relationship between the smart parent of Meimei and her own grandmother is not explained, or even glossed over. We are given mere crumbs, which is cruel since the table had been set for a serious breakdown of Chinese culture.

There are no memorable lines in this movie. There are few interesting 'shots' and commendatory angles being exercised, and frankly, I don't understand why, unless this film has been in development hell. Of that I know nothing.

The script for this is disappointing. There is not enough crazy gags to paper over the cracks in the story. So unless a viewer is very young, he or she will find that something is wrong in this animation. The idea for the script itself is not exciting. The plot barely covers a 20 page children's illustrated book.

If Pixar cannot deliver for me, then cinematically I'm in big trouble. I better start paying more attention to the flops of Altman and Fellini etc before getting myself excited for a brand of animation that has expended all of its ideas by Toy Story 4.

I love to read about other cultures, me being Non American Indian by stock. The Chinese live all round me in my country of birth. I am not being unfair to this movie. I am just expressing my pressing thoughts before I forget them. I think though, that another team of creators better take a shot at Chinese themes next. While it is true that writers are a dime a dozen, Disney has spread itself so thin on output for the content guzzling Disney+, that even at a dime a dozen, Disney is probably underpaying their writers. A neat trick this... make a resource so scarce that it becomes a luxury, then ignore the needs of the company for fresher and more expensive blood.","15 September 2022",5,2,3
"Turning Red","Is Disney pandering to China? Probably. Did I still laugh constantly throughout only to tear up moments later? Absolutely. Pacing, graphics, story, music, character design ...all spot on. I don't think a Pixar film ever made me laugh out loud as often before. Glad to see Pixar still has it, and haters are always going to hate.","13 March 2022",8,12,37
"Turning Red","I feel like the advertising for Turning Red really let the film down. It was a movie I was not expecting to like, and yet 20 minutes in I was sold. It wasn't what I expected at all; I truly loved this film and think its right up there with some of Pixar's more iconic works. It's very different from anything else Pixar has produced, from its content and characters to its animation style, but I love that these risks were taken, and especially loved that a family animation film actually discussed topics such as puberty and periods, as well as all the other physical and emotional changes that come with adolescence. It plays more like a quirky coming of age live action film (Lady Bird, Juno, Breakfast Club) than a mainstream animated family film. This of course limits its broad appeal, as some may not be able to connect with this film, but I would argue that the film serves as a reminder that there is a common human experience that expresses itself in different ways for everyone. While I, a 19 year-old male, cannot personally relate to the experience of getting your first period, there were many elements of the film that rang very true to me, from the feelings of embarrassment and awkwardness to the increased reliance on friends over family. I also liked that the film encourages its audience to embrace their oddities and quirks and ""let their panda out"" / be themselves, a message I really liked as someone filled with unique and admittedly weird personality traits (*cough* movie junkie *cough*). It even had messages for parents which was really interesting, I loved how the film explored the parent and child dynamics and relationship. While it is indeed a charming and cute film, with endearing characters and some beautiful, expressive and colourful animation, I found it was deeply profound, emotionally resonant and wonderfully nostalgic. I loved really getting to know the characters, especially as we got to see the facade they put up in public vs the person they were with friends/family and how this contributed to the overall message of the film. As well, I loved the exploration of the relationship between the mother and daughter and how this drove the film. The film was also surprisingly funny and had such an awesomely surprising third act! I also loved the Toronto setting and how many Canadian details the film got right (even down to the look of our old paper $5 bills). This film is what it is because of some truly amazing work from Domee Shi, known for directing the fantastic Pixar short film ""Bao"". She really has such a strong and unique voice, one I feel she could even bring over to live action filmmaking. She is truly a talent to watch and knows how to handle complex emotional topics in such interesting, profound and entertaining ways. I really hope Pixar keeps her around! She made such a personal and emotionally resonant film, one that works even if you may not share the exact same cultural or personal experiences. It was a film really driven from the heart, and I really wish Disney didn't dump it on Disney+, it deserved a full theatrical experience (which it was intended for). It really surprised me how much I liked this movie, not only did it tell a very profound and honest coming of age story, but it was just a lot of fun! As with all Pixar films, I highly recommend checking this one out, its really something special and so delightful!","14 March 2022",8,5,13
"Turning Red","To all the upset incels crying ""woke"" because a film discusses female issues, grow up the world doesn't revolve around you. This one you're not keen on that's ok because the next one will probably appeal. Well done Pixar for attempting something ""different"" though Ginger Snaps did do it 20 years earlier. The world is changing whether you like it or not.","11 March 2022",8,5,7
"Turning Red","LIKES:

The Cultural Aspect: For a movie about the Asian culture of tradition, pressure, and family honor, the movie has succeeded in my limited knowledge of portraying some of these elements well. Turning Red is not afraid to point out the hardships of the balanced life, and the expectations that sometimes become a prison to the life of balance they preach. Within that strict dynamic though, we get some really cool looks into the legends, traditions, and other facets of the traditional life and more so how it fights the modernization era. I really liked the elements we saw, like the good Mulan, and how it was integrated into the story and world quite well without being too in your face.

The Voice Acting: While they are not my favorite characters of the bunch, voice acting is on par with quality given the direction I think this movie was trying to achieve. Turning Red puts, you in sort of the comedy-romance anime feel, and those who have seen the media of Japanese animation know how dynamic the voice acting gets. The cast accomplishes that energy with each of the characters attaching themselves to an aspect I feel is very in touch with the anime atmosphere. Rosalie Chiang as the star is the plucky character with a lot to say, do, and think through, and a voice that really represents that protagonist attitude for each type of emotion. It's loud, prominent, and bold, working with the character they have set up with. Oh, as the mom is a bit out of place from the anime style, but turns out to be my favorite voice work in how collected, professional, and balanced she delivers on Ming's matriarch role proving once more her talent as an actress. As for Ava, her presentation is a blend of the two previously mentioned actors, a bit extreme in the one crowd, but able to turn on the professional balance and class that Pixar is known for having. This character is a very impressive supporting role, and I was very happy with the performances generated in this film. There are so many other voices to compliment, but Disney's recruitment on this project gives you the feel of this CGI anime that is sprinkled with the antics of Pixar studios and it works on many levels to bring this group to life.

The Comedy: It's not the movie I have laughed the hardest at, but props for Turning Red managing to put some comedy that is a bit bolder than the usual repertoire. Pixar's group manages to make some seedier jokes and more aggressive comedy, poking fun at the ridiculousness of the modern-day trends. Boy band hotness and these daydreams of extreme ""romantic"" moments, the capitalism on being stupid on media, and even on the quirks that some outdated traditions can hold in the modern world. It's clever, but more importantly an equilibrium of in your face and storytelling that I appreciate in the modern world that fails to find the balance. Even more so, there are again those well-written moments, with the perfect timing that are difficult to avoid laughing at and something I fully enjoyed in this film.

The Emotional Depth: It's not a Disney movie without going into the fathoms of our soul and making us take an inner look at ourselves, to ironically post online later. Pixar continues to blow this out of the water for me, in many cases better than Walt Disney Animation productions, in that it has a tendency to be more natural and less scripted. Turning Red has plenty of scripted moments, but the visual storytelling is calmer and more impressive, the natural evolution of the characters flowing more with the fun of the story, and those heart-breaking moments still packing the uppercut to knock you into self-reflection. It's very smart writing and does not get in the way of the ""adventure"" like Soul did, meaning that you get to enjoy the antics and still learn something. To my understanding from several friends, those who relate to this movie will find themselves even more immersed in these moments, so bravo.

Animation: By far my favorite element of this movie, is the design and animation of the world we are playing in this movie. Turning Red may not look the most realistic or mind blowing of the Pixar films, but the quirky, extreme shapes of the anime influence that it holds are very fun. I loved how much I felt in one of those teenage love shows famous right now, and the colors and animation popping out in full glory in that extreme happy-happy energy used in the media. Pixar then manages to change the moments though depending on the time, from surreal worlds of the dreams they have to the dark and foreboding moments when things take a darker turn. The brilliant use of lighting, with the change in color pallets result in one heck of a design that is cute and welcoming, but then goes deeper and I love the elements of the city that we find ourselves in. It's a world that is fun to play in, and is not so lost in itself to not let the movie be the adventure it's meant to be. And once the animation starts, well things only get better from there. Pixar's work is still fluid, and though again not the most impressive spectacle, the approach of anime with animal anatomy results in the quality piece we got with this film. I love the cleverness they baked into it, blending the worlds together, which once again leads to the fun this movie contains.

DISLIKES:

The Lack of a Disney Villain: If you are like me and integrated into the history of the Disney cinema world, you know that the villains are almost as memorable as the movie itself. Once again, the modern storytelling has denied us a villain that will remain in the imaginations of kids to emulate and imitate around Halloween. I can't say much, but the villain is again more metaphorical than truly evil and I'm missing Disney's creativity in this department with this latest rendition.

A Bit Too Extreme at Times: This primarily for the characters, but unless you are relating to the characters on personal levels (as most seem to do these days), the girls are annoying compared to other characters. Mei Mei and her crew are very ""teenage stereotype"" with associated squeals to go with it. Ironically, that was not the worst part about them for me though, it was the modern agenda writing that they spouted at times that my tolerance is low to handle. Turning Red promotes it's messages like a TikTok video, and while many enjoy that style of media, it's lost on me and a bit too much for writing that is cheesy hits me in this film.

The Music: Disney's work used to be more impressive to me in most of their films, (like what we got with Encanto). Turning Red's soundtrack is okay, and a great comedic device that the writers exploit and turn into skits or plot devices. And while Billie Eilish may have that new age sound, it was not my favorite track to the Disney lineup. Some works that are more orchestral are awesome, but the other components were lost on me in this film and forgettable.

The Lack of Adventure: This goes back to the clever/creative comment earlier, in terms of how many adventure elements are taking a back seat on Disney. Turning Red's adventure has turned inward again, checking the boxes of battling inner struggles vs. Outer struggles. While this is important and deeply character rooted, I do miss the tales we got with Toy Story, A Bug's Life, Monster's Inc/University, The Incredibles that blended adventure into their drama elements. This is like an afterschool special with the anime twist, but the lack of big antagonist, the focus of not traveling to too many fantasy worlds, and trying to focus on real life stuff again seems to rob the Pixar quality that I love. These two worlds can coexist (see Inside Out), but this film still shifts towards the current trend of internal struggle as the theme of the movie. Given the Red Panda legacy and the traditions built up, I had hoped for a break from the realistic focus and back into the imagination world, but not quite there yet. As such, I never felt connected to the characters in terms of anything happening to them like I had with the other protagonists of their films.

The VERDICT:

Turning Red is cute, cuddly, and fun on many levels to be worthy of the big screen (if it came to it), but at least the family night. A respectful nod to cultures, Pixar has crafted a world of modern and imagination, designing a high energy film that just screams anime fanbase and Disney fanbase uniting. It's got good voice acting, alongside comedic writing to work with the voices, giving you that usual Disney family fun you are looking to ride into. Characters are realistic and relatable to many, and the emotional depth to the film works to speak to various generations who see this film, often without going overboard in the scripted writing. However, the movie's great design and elements cannot hide the fact it still is not the most adventurous of the Pixar films. There is no clear villain or even dive into the usual Pixar imagination, instead focusing heavy on the relatable/real-life quirks to examine and relish (while capitalizing on the hot trends). Those who find themselves in the modern-day trends of TikTok loving, anime drama, and relating to these characters will enjoy this movie to the nines, while others may find these heavy-handed moments annoying given the avenues they could have explored. Though a bit extreme in their antics... I do have to say that this movie is still better than some of Disney's other media shows (The new Doogie, Monsters at Work, Raven's Home), in that it is still fun and entertaining. However, I'm hoping for an adventure film to break this streak of self-aware films to help freshen things up again. My scores for the film are:

Animation/Adventure/Comedy: 8.0
Movie Overall: 7.0.","12 March 2022",8,18,78
"Turning Red","The good moments are few and far between; the protagonist and her friends are quite annoying. The songs aren't great, the dancing is quite awful. The animation is a mixed bag. Sometimes it looks fabulous but most of the time not so much. The art direction, though, was lacking. It's all over the place. Too many ""tears"" for my taste. Worst of all, it wasn't funny, it wasn't smart and it doesn't even have a good message. Possibly the worst message one could ever get is to get used to one's ""messy"" side. Where's the good in that? All in all, I wouldn't recommend it. I did not have fun.","5 August 2022",2,3,5
"Turning Red","It's a shame this movie was so bad, as it's easily one of Disney's most beautiful. The animation is stunning and impressive. The panda is so adorable. This movie could have been so, so good as long as it was different in nearly every way in its substance. Turning Red has the worst storyline, is rife with toxic relationships, and is devoid of any substantial good messaging.

Do NOT believe the fake hype around the whole period issue. What's wrong with this movie is you'll be waiting forever for *any* good messaging whatsoever and it never comes.

The movie almost praises it's main character for her terrible behaviour. When she begins to disobey her mother and sneak out of the house at night her friends praise her for not acting like herself - someone who's a ""goody two-shoes"" and gets good grades. This was so confusing for all of us, as those are good traits. Nearly every personal relationship is incredibly toxic - specifically the one she has with her mother. It's not uncommon to see a struggling parent/child relationship in movies - but this one just never really gets resolved, and is at times so unbelievable.

Lastly, the movie wants us to get nostalgic for the early 00's when boy bands were popular. It is so over-the-top in all of the worst ways. The main characters interest in boys is a main focal point of the movie and it's constant. It was so frustrating to watch. Even my 11 year old didn't get it.

This feels like a movie made by 30 year olds, for 30 year olds. The nostalgic references just don't land. Not this generation of kids. I hated it. Don't watch it.","17 March 2022",1,11,22
"Turning Red","Despite few unabashed eye-rolling moments, Domee Shi perfectly presented Asian culture into Pixar's universal theme with such relatable family story from female perspective. Mei & Red Panda brought cute and inventive metaphors over drop-dead gorgeous animation.","14 March 2022",8,7,23
"Turning Red","Great if you want to encourage your children to have temper tantrums.

Not a movie for young children. Which was to my surprise given it's a Disney/Pixar movie.","9 April 2022",1,6,14
"Turning Red","An outgoing Chinese-American girl transitions into early adulthood, triggering an inherited blessing/curse that transforms her into a giant red panda when stressed out. Which, given the competing pressures of schoolwork, steep family expectations and a busy social life, is pretty much all the time. After a brief period of panicked self-isolation, she learns to control the ability and embraces her new lifestyle, but Mom is less tolerant and insists upon a time-honored ritual that will seal the panda away for good.

As message-heavy family films go, this isn't half bad, but it falls short when compared to the lofty standards of Pixar's catalog. Mostly because so many of its essential beats have already been struck. Brave hit the mother-daughter dynamic, complete with waves of shiny red hair. Inside Out taught us to have self-confidence and love ourselves. Coco dealt with the weight of family secrets and traditions. I could probably name a dozen more that involve the trials and tribulations of growing up. The fresh cultural flavor is a plus, and lively extroverts aren't usually the focus of this studio's films, but those perks aren't enough to save this from feeling like a big-time retread.

On a positive note, it looks incredible. Oodles of color, rich textures and quaint dashes of character fill out a vibrant, energetic city setting, with a super-duper cute lead character (whether she's a human or an animal) dominating most every scene. It's not a miss, it's just very safe.","18 March 2022",6,8,29
"Turning Red","""Turning Red"" is the 25th CGI animated film by Disney Pixar. Directed and co-written by Domee Shi (""Bao""), it is a cute little story enhanced by the usual great animation and art style one would expect from the legendary studio.

In 2002, 13-year-old Meilin ""Mei"" Lee (voiced by Rosalie Chiang) lives with her family in a Chinese temple in downtown Toronto, Canada. Ever since she was little, Mei has worked hard to appease her strict mother Ming (voiced by Sandra Oh), achieving high marks at school and downplaying her own personal interests. One morning, Mei wakes up to discover she has transformed into a giant red panda, later deducing that she has the power to do so when her emotions run wild. Mei soon reveals the secret to her parents who explain that this ability to transform is hereditary among all female members of the family and that the only way to stop it is to seal it away through an ancient ritual on the night of the Red Moon. As preparations for the ritual draw closer, Mei starts to take a liking to her transformative act, entertaining her friends and learning more about herself in the process.

In addition to being gloriously entertaining, Pixar films have often included cleverly hidden messages and themes for audiences of all ages to appreciate. For example, ""Inside Out"" deals with the handling of unfortunate events in life to help grow into a happier person while ""Coco"" shows the importance of leaving behind a great legacy for not only yourself but your loved ones. If anything, it's become something of a tradition for Pixar to insert things like this into their movies, and that is also the case here for ""Turning Red"", which touches on the rather taboo topic of going through puberty.

Essentially, the film is a not-so-subtle metaphor for what it must be like for girls ascending to womanhood, complete with references to growing out of old childish habits and even allusions to the 'time of the month"". Considering the squeaky clean image they try to maintain, it's quite bold of Disney to have allowed a film with such themes to be made, but I applaud them for doing so. It is inevitable that all young girls who are watching will eventually experience changes to their bodies as they grow older, so to have a film like this help them understand it is normal to go through these type of things should prove comforting. By having Mei transform into a red panda and gradually teaching herself to stay in control of her emotions, young female viewers can easily pick up on this allegory for maturing into a responsible adult while at the same time enjoying the film for the amusing concept in of itself.

However, all of this does prove problematic in the end as it narrows the audience pool quite significantly. Another thing that Pixar have succeeded at in the past is making films that appeal to both male and female audiences at the same time. It can be difficult marketing a family movie with female leads to young boys but films like ""Brave"" and the aforementioned ""Inside Out"" all featured a female protagonist yet still managed to have enough universal material for males to enjoy them just as much. As this film touches on exclusively female issues, male viewers are probably going to feel alienated and uncomfortable by themes involving the bodily functions of girls during the early stages of puberty. Moments that reference the menstrual cycle and various other matters regarding the developmental stages of girls doesn't sound all that enticing to a male audience. That's not to say that males should never have to know about what girls go through when growing up, it's just that this film never really makes an effort to present it in a way that everyone can understand. As a male myself, I admit I did find the whole transforming into a red panda analogy for growing up quite clever but when the film started making jokes about Mei needing pads, it made me realise that the true target audience of this film is solely the female demographic. I can't imagine many male kids going into this film and enjoying it too much but I'm sure that girls will like it a whole lot more.

It goes without saying that Pixar films always deliver on the visual front. Since the film is called ""Turning Red"", the colour red is featured rather prominently. We see it in Mei's attire, in her temple home with the decorative lanterns and candles, and even in the lighting during certain flashback scenes. Even the flag of Canada is mostly red, which is where this film is set. In Chinese culture, the colour red is used to symbolise good fortune and commemoration, which is appropriate considering the characters in the film are celebrating Mei becoming a young woman. There's also a nice balance between the cartoonish-looking humans and the photorealistic objects in the foreground. Something as simple as the wrinkles on a dumpling have so much attention-to-detail placed on them and the steam they emit looks so real as well. Even if you aren't fully immersed in this film's story, I think everyone can still at least appreciate its beautiful visual style.

In the lead role, newcomer Rosalie Chiang has now established herself as an actress to keep an eye on. She voices Mei with so much visceral energy and determination that you can't help but like her instantly. Even when transformed into a giant red panda, Chiang never misses a beat when tapping into Mei's personal insecurities and youthful charm. It was fun to see her interact with her group of friends who all have differing personalities, ranging from deadpan to life of the party. As a side note, since the film is set in 2002, it was also nice to see the kids functioning without modern day technology like smartphones and the internet. Worth mentioning as well is Sandra Oh as Mei's authoritative mother Ming. Though she seems like a typical strict Asian mother at first, we see that Ming does care deeply about her only daughter and wants what's best for her, even if she does get carried away most of the time.

Despite having a very specific target audience in mind, ""Turning Red"" is still an enjoyable addition to the Pixar catalogue. Granted, it could have been much better had it found ways to appeal to everyone and not just female viewers but for what it is, it still all comes together quite nicely. If you have young daughters, then this should be an ideal film to not only entertain them, but also help educate them about growing up. On the other hand, if you have sons, you'd probably be better off looking elsewhere.

I rate it 7.5/10.","17 March 2022",8,8,28

"Turning Red","From its first ever film, ""Toy story"", Pixar has delved into the themes of parent-child relationships, school, and even family expectations. But now, it does that in a different manner; gone are the only-white, middle-class children and teenagers searching for approval, or the princesses fighting against their royal destiny. Now, Pixar steps into uncharted territory with diverse heroes, and refreshing views on family and change. One of the films doing that is ""Turning red"".

""Turning red"" has faced a lot of backlash by both critics and Disney fans for not being ""relatable"" and for ""teaching kids to disobey their parents"". This, honestly, is totally wrong. ""Turning red's"" plot revolves around a Chinese-Canadian girl named Meilin, who is facing the most difficult period of one's life; puberty. Having hit thirteen, she wants to go to the concert of her favourite boy band, 4*Town, with her group of as-different-as-it-gets friends. Until she discovers that every time she experiences an intense feeling, she transforms into a red panda. Now, how will she control it, in order to go see 4*Town?

The movie deals with a lot of themes, including stereotypes, finding one's self, and overcoming family expectations. Meilin is the classic child of immigrants, who feel that she absolutely has to succeed and become a successful adult. Her mother represents the ""tiger mom"" type of parent, made famous by the book ""Battle hymn of the tiger mother"". In it, a Chinese mother described how she brought up her children implementing methods ranging from the questionable to the cruel, aiming to create sensible, accomplished members of the society. The animated mother, Ming, also wants her daughter to excell, and has instilled to her the view that children owe their parents, only because of them bring their parents. In order to pay out this debt, Mei Li excells in school, always obeys her loved ones and has the level of school popularity that an insect has.

The panda matter is first dealt with fear by the heroine, who is anxious about disappointing her family, and going to the concert. But, in the course of the story, she discovers how beneficial it can be to both her status at school, and her collecting money for the event. She transforms from a nerdy, obedient little girl, to a mature teenager proud with herself. It's this transition from childhood to adulthood that the colour of the panda signifies. For, the first thing that often comes to mind when mentioning ""red"", especially for a woman, is the period. Meilin's mother first thinks that her daughter got her period when she hears her screaming in the bathroom. That she gets so upset about this biological phenomenon just goes to show how she treats her daughter, sheltering her from the truths of adulthood while at the same time preparing her for the obligations of the outside world.

There is a position supported by the philosopher Jane English, about the obligations of children towards their parents. She essentially believes that children owe nothing to their parents, because they didn't even agree to be born by them. She instead proposes that children should treat their parents as friends. No obligations, except if both parties have made an agreement. What would be Ming's reaction to this suggestion? At first glance, she may have disagreed, but there is more to her than meets the eye. We must not forget that Ming, too, had stroke no deal to be born by her oppressive mother. The option of friendship between parent and child simply doesn't exist for her. It has disappeared under the force of family expectations.

While the film has a very interesting subject, it is also commendable for its music. Written by Billie Eilish and her borther Phineas, it sounds just like these 2000's hits we all know and (not) love. 4*Town themselves are a parody of popular boybands of the time, such as the Backstreet boys and N*SYNC, part of the director's, Domi Shi's, attempt to capture the feeling of the 2000's, when she grew up. Aesthetically,, I didn't like it, but it serves the film excellently and for this it deserves praise.

""Turning red"" is a film well worth watching. It portrays its sensitive subject matter with respect and compassion for both sides, and teaches valuable lessons about family, friendship and self-esteem. Like every Pixar film, it aims for the heart, not the brain. Mine was certainly touched by it.","20 March 2022",9,4,10
"Turning Red","You know, I respect anyone's opinions as long as they are understandable, respectful and make sure it makes sense. But some opinions, even in this website are just downright terrible and insane, especially the most controversial review of this movie is much even worse than the other bad reviews, so I strongly disagree with them. They should all be ashamed for not understanding this movie.

Regardless, I just watched Turning Red and I absolutely love the film, it features a 13 year old girl named ""Mei"" who enjoys having fun with her friends and yet people see her as totally awkward. Her mom, ""Ming"" is a good mother, but when it comes to Mei getting involved into something, Ming becomes overprotective. Then all of a sudden, Mei transforms into a big red panda due to her emotions, every time Mei gets emotional, she turns into a giant red panda which is very interesting and creative.

Overall, Turning Red is amazing, the humor is good, most of the characters are likeable, there are strong and beautiful heartwarming moments, the art style is great, I love how it resembles the style of classic anime, the story is well-done and again, the red panda plot is very creative. I would consider Turning Red to be one of my favorite Pixar movies of all time and not just that, but also one of the best Pixar movies of all time. I highly recommend you to watch it. I give Turning Red a 9.8/10.","17 March 2022",9,7,22
"Turning Red","Overall it was all right, not really funny but my 6YO enjoyed it a lot. I gave it an extra star purely because it normalises takling about periods and female cycle - practically all women get it but it has not really been talked about so openly on the big screen in a big budget animatin for children and young adults before. Good job 👍","11 March 2022",8,8,17
"Turning Red","I see a lot of hate for this movie. And I get it. Sometimes I also get too critical about things and it prevents me from enjoying them. But I'm glad to say it wasn't the case for Turning Red. I had a blast. It's so incredibly cringy, trust me I completely agree with that. But it's cringy like most teenagers are, and as far as I'm concerned, it contributed to the charm of the movie.

If you didn't like this movie, it's completely fine, but I think being so overly negative toward such a harmless movie for kids is simply not worth it.","16 April 2022",7,5,7
"Turning Red","It's beyond ridiculous that anyone could say this movie is more than five stars, the storyline is dreadful and cringe I have to say Pixar have lost their way this movie is a disaster from start to finish.","13 March 2022",1,18,38
"Turning Red","I'm old school, but enjoyed this films. Makes you smile from start to finish. So just leaving this out there, for haters to hate. Admit you like this, and move on!!!!","11 March 2022",9,14,42
"Turning Red","Worst Pixar movie ever and I cannot say enough about the disgusting messaging in this movie. Usually a big Disney and Pixar fan but this movie was so horrible that I am strongly reconsidering where my money goes....... So dissapointing.","13 March 2022",1,18,38
"Turning Red","To start with, I just gave the movie 4 points for the sake of the good animation but that's all.

Turning Red inholds the worst moral messages I have ever seen in an animation: insignificance of family and altruism, praise for confused individualism, and stabilisation in behavioural instability.

I sometimes turned red myself when I hear some lines in the movie. Especially, in every scene where the family is despised.

Growing up is a unique challenge for every child but Turning Red chooses to depict a destructive example rather then telling a more constructive and complete journeys.

I missed the times whence Pixar was telling constructive, mind opening, and heartwarming stories rather than delivering chaotic messages that would no help both for children and adults.","28 October 2022",4,3,4
"Turning Red","For kids, it's an adventure of liberation and self-acceptance, and for parents it's a cautionary tale of the dangers of over-parenting: that punishing rebellion too harshly only forces rebellion into secrecy. This is all conveyed with no shortage of humor and style, making it the most distinctive animated film to come out of Pixar in ages, jam-packed with anime references and excellent visual gags. Its relatability may not be applicable to everyone, but that's exactly what makes it authentic, real, and beautiful.","21 April 2022",10,2,3
"Turning Red","This movie misses the classic Disney/Pixar trait in that it isn't meant for all audiences. It feels much more aimed at females exclusively and while that's a great angle to take in this political climate it's just not what Disney/Pixar movies have been. Very disappointed, but I also feel like this is just the direction Disney movies are going.","15 March 2022",4,9,15
"Turning Red","I related with this movie sooooo much. Perfect and appropriate coming of age. Nailed it on the teenage girl. Omgoodness this was soooo me and my mum. ASuper cute movie about autonomy and healing trauma and being yourself. I looooooooved this movie and so do my kids. It helped my daughter understand she is loved for who she is and not who people think she should be. It's perfect.","19 March 2022",10,6,15
"Turning Red","Avoid this movie at all cost if you're over the age of 15. The most annoying character Disney has ever produced on purpose. I legit feel bad for the investors who had to sit through the screening not sure if they would turn a profit.","18 March 2022",1,12,27
"Turning Red","This movie delves deeply into the ins and outs of being a 13 year old in 2002! As someone who relates heavily to the main character I wish I had this representation when I was that young. It's funny and adorable, but isn't afraid to dive deep into topics that people experience and relate to! 10/10 perfect for the family!","11 March 2022",10,9,15
"Turning Red","Can't fault it whatsoever. Wonderful soft animation with anime influences for expressions. Touched on really important subjects in a smart way. Depicts what an uplifting and suporting friendship looks like and how perfectionistic parenting affects the child. Also how heartbreaking is parents wanting their child to hide parts of themselves.

I could relate to so much of it. And yay for periods being destigmatised.

The only dissapointing thing is that men watching this, instead of being interested in being gifted an open door of girls' experience of puberty are 'I can't relate! It sucks!' Funny how had no trouble relating with animated Pixar cars, monsters, ants and robots. Girls are more unnatural and otherworldly than all of those things I guess.","22 March 2022",10,4,8
"Turning Red","I have to start with the amount of adult people reviewing this movie and saying things like:
""it made me uncomfortable""
""i didn't understand it""
""i couldn't relate""
No1 - its a kids movie.

No2 - just because you aren't female, you couldn't relate? Its a children's movie!

I can't relate to being a giant red panda, but i still enjoyed it.

This movie has a really good moral and metaphorical story to it.

Its a coming of age movie informing kids that they don't have to be who they are told to be. It is also a coming of age metaphor for young girls experiencing a change in their bodies. (it happens, and its natural so chill out).

I loved the story and i loved the Asian influence. I saw one review saying the ""mother was one of the worst characters and was really annoying"". That character is very accurate is some Asian cultures. An over baring parent with high expectations from their child, pressuring them to do well and the child seeking constant approval or feeling like they are not good enough. It happens more often than you think.

People saying its not appropriate for children because of the hidden messages - have you not seen the Shrek movies?

The animation is as always - amazing.

The story is clever and interesting.

Characters - some of the friends were a bit annoying at the beginning, but they grew on me.

Ignore the bad reviews, make up your own mind.

And buy the way, I am not a woman or Asian. I just have an interest in different people and cultures.","18 March 2022",8,5,13
"Turning Red","It's not the first time Disney and Pixar have dived firmly into a culturally expansive community - or world, with last year's Encanto being set in Columbia and now Turning Red, being set around one Chinese family in Canada...okay so a lot smaller in scale than Columbia. But that doesn't mean Turning Red doesn't deliver. The film centres itself on pint sized protagonist, 13 year old Meilin Lee, a confident, dorky and often loud spoken teenager who tries her hardest to fight for her perfectionist mother's approval with good grades, perfect attendance and her attitude to always be the good girl. Yet inside she has a big fluffy secret, when her life changes, in more ways than one, her interests, relationships, and whenever she gets too excited, she turns into a big fluffy admittedly very cute red panda. If only puberty was as fluffy and cute for all of us.

Onto the matter at hand, Turning Red - like most Pixar films is a stunningly animated, clever and often funny family comedy, that again like Disney's latest trends is extremely relatable - and not just the puberty bit. We all yearn to be outspoken, and the film isn't afraid to come to terms with that. The film is clever as already pointed out, not so much in it's script, in fact that's the aspect that isn't so clever. But the theming of a dorky and if a little wired teenage girl who just wants to be normal, she has her rambunctious friends for help in that department as they are just as loud and confident as she is. But then that just shows storytelling grandeur that with her friends it's a heartwarming often empowering tale of girl power that is a wonderfully vibrant ode to those awkward pre-teen and teen years. And it's not the first time Disney have peaked highly in that region, but indeed when there's success sometimes there is failure, or in this case script problems. Where the script fails, the film finds itself searching for material, but don't let that put you off.

Turning Red is a bright, shimmering and often funny empowering tale that combines humour and relatable storytelling in beautifully animated fashion and yet again extends Pixar's already long list of deft heart and family friendly films that will remain with you for a long time. Even through the craziness and messiness of puberty, but then all of us want puberty to be just as fluffy, bright and cute as this film shows. 4/5.","12 March 2022",8,12,48
"Turning Red","Honestly my partner and I had such a good time watching this. It's so relatable, hilariously funny, at times outrageous, all while being a fresh Pixar movie with a unique story and nothing but investable characters. The amount of thought and detail that went into every single character was genius and shows just how much the filmmakers cared about the movie and the proof is in the pudding. Wonderful film, can't wait to watch it again.","13 March 2022",9,6,16
"Turning Red","I love Disney Pixar films, always have. And, this delivered!! Big time!!

For me, this was better than Encanto and that is no easy feat - I'm still recovering from the feels that left me with haha!

I also like so many people got salty at it, its so good if you give it a chance! One of the funniest things I've seen in a while!","20 March 2022",10,5,9
"Turning Red","Pixar's take on the confusion of entering puberty involves a high-achiever girl making a quick transition from horny teen to an adorable teddy bear. After that there's a whole bunch of learning and family stuff and friend stuff and boy bands and magic and wanton destruction and it's all lots of fun.

I related to growing pains but this is pretty girl-centric so it was interesting to see how much of this resonated with my girlfriend, who clearly found this super relatable.

It's not my favorite Pixar but it's definitely in that fine second tier Pixar movies, which is still better than most studio's first tier. Absolutely recommended.","1 April 2022",8,5,17
"Turning Red","The Panda/ Red fox makes you fall in love when you watch the movie trailer for the first time. As for the movie, it's a disappointment.

I watched the movie with my two nephews. Soon I realized that it was a mistake with their tons of uncomfortable questions.

Anyhow the movie was not entertaining. I don't remember disliking an Animation movie, so this took me by surprise.

The main character was nowhere near cute, she was irritating.","21 April 2022",5,3,6
"Turning Red","I don't get the others call the movie stereotypical or annoying. I guess that's because they knew it's true. Asian parents are largely like what's portrayed in the movie, end of the story. They are getting better but it is a real thing as an asian myself.

The film is exactly what I want the parents to know, the movie speaks for myself, we children will grow up, we will have our lives to live, we will change, and each of us is different and unique. We want to live a life to the fullest, to be happy and enjoying life. We cannot live being suppressed by some traditional closed mindset our parents have. A lot of the time, what the parents think is the best for their children turns out actually not. And this movie is all about letting oneself discover themselves, discover their ""inner panda"". 10/10 on the truth of the story.","12 March 2022",10,9,23
"Turning Red","It's a movie about getting your period and turning into a panda. That's fine and all but just putting that out there. I wasn't really expecting that. Kind of a conversation I would rather have than leave up to Pixar but I digress. Its actually pretty sexist and offensive as well. Basically plays on the old tropes that we become over emotional and crazy during that time of the month. Kind of shocking really.","13 March 2022",2,10,22
"Turning Red","Here's the thing... If you go into this movie expecting wholesome family entertainment, you're going to be extremely disappointed. If you go into expecting Pixar's Teen Wolf, that might be a little more on the nose. Turning Red is about a young woman going through puberty. Discovering hormones. All that jazz. There's talk about maxi pads and periods and cramps. There's a lot of arguing between mom and daughter. Every parent is going to have a different idea of what age it's appropriate for your kids to watch a movie about a girl essentially having her sexual awakening (don't get me wrong, the most we see is her face turning red as she sweats and draws pictures of herself embracing a boy). So make that decision for yourself before watching with any young people in your house.

I've seen a lot of angry comments about how this movie is just about ""disrespecting your parents!!"" and I wanna say, for me, that was not the take-away. I grew up with movies like The Little Mermaid and Lion King and Mulan and ALL those ""classics"" were about kids disobeying their parents and putting themselves in mortal danger by doing so. So what? The songs were great.

My biggest issue with Turning Red was actually the hostility of the mom. Had I been that 13 year old girl, I would have probably yelled at my mom and gone to hang out with my friends instead, too! There was just a lot of contention between mother and daughter (without any real resolution. Just...oh we had an angry blow out and we're fine now!!), adults being huge hypocrites, and overall so much yelling in this movie. I wasn't a huge fan. I think as far as a movie for pre-teens going through puberty, it's pretty good. A little underwhelming, but decent. There was such a missed opportunity to make this a hard-hitting. Emotional movie. But overall, it was all right. Like, had Disney specifically marketed Turning Red as a movie about puberty, the consumer reviews wouldn't be so vastly different from the ""critic"" reviews. BUT, it wasn't marketed as such. The previews were all incredibly vague and only gave away cute, fluffy parts. So while I don't agree with all the 1 star reviews, I do think Disney/Pixar set itself up for that one.

Exercise common sense when watching with your kids. Do you want them seeing a scene where the mom is literally spying on her 13 year old at school and screaming ""YOU FORGOT YOUR PADS!!!"" and holding up a box of winged maxi pads?? If so, enjoy. If not, look elsewhere.","14 March 2022",5,4,6
"Turning Red","The movie is good, but while I'm no prude, I find it a bit too much having a ""13 year old"" girl character twerk in an animation movie. It's not the kind of stuff you want any kid to see and imitate. It's rather of bad taste. I understand the story of coming of age, but this rather sexualizing act shouldn't have been done in a Pixar movie.

It's PG, sure, but they know this would be watched by every kid from 3 to 13.","24 March 2022",6,3,6
"Turning Red","Watched Turning Red with Rosalie Chiang as Mei Lee, Sandra Oh(Killing Eve) as Ming Lee, Ava Morse as Miriam Mendelsohn, Maitreyi Ramakrishnan(Doom Patrol) as Priya Mangal, Hyein Park as Abbey Park, Orion Lee as Jin Lee, and James Hong(Mulan, Kung Fu Panda Trilogy) as Mr. Gao.

I really enjoyed this film it was cool coming of age story also sometimes we dont know what we want in life sometimes it had great moments of comedy also loved I also loved this was in the vein of Kim Convenience also set in Toronto, Canada as well also criticizing to the film not acknowledging 9-11 hello not everything revolves around us Americans also enjoyed its inclusivity as well it revolving around a concert as well Mei's self discovery and growing pains and being a Red Panda makes it that much worse A Fantastic Coming Of Age Film with Animal Twist.

Score By Ludwig Gorransson(The Book Of Boba Fett) , Direction By Domee Shi(Bao) A Fantastic Coming Of Age Film with Animal Twist 10/10.","15 May 2022",10,3,8
"Turning Red","Watched with 13yr old daughter. 46 min in, we had enough. Mom acts inappropriate and is a bully. Mei Mei is disrespectful and Dad is silent bystander.

I don't need to watch animation reacting to a teens first menstrual cycle & my daughter laughed continuously over how dumb the reactions were towards boys.

""I feel so attacked as an 8th grader. This is so over the top.""","2 April 2022",1,9,16
"Turning Red","As an Asian, the story about overbearing parent s very relatable. Thats how Asian kids under the effect of traditional Taoism is raised. Dont know how some reviews can see this film as a leftist brainwashing technique. Just relax and enjoy the fun and adorable movie.","12 March 2022",10,8,15
"Turning Red","I don't think Pixar has ever really made a bad film, and Turning Red is by no means a failure. It is beautifully animated, and it's good to get an insight, albeit fictional, into the culture of a different community.

This isn't a Disney film, so the fact it tackles issues such as menstruation, although a little jarring, isn't actually that surprising.

Unfortunately, the plot feels extremely derivative, essentially being a spin on the 80s coming-of-age film Teen Wolf. The jokes also tend to fall flat, and the main character and all her friends are really quite annoying.

However - and I think this is important - that's part of its authenticity. Teenagers often are annoying. Their jokes really are lame. And they do tend to make terrible decisions.

Turning Red isn't one of Pixar's best - not by a long shot. But it is an interesting one, simultaneously treading new ground while also being oddly unimaginative.

If I'd paid to watch it at the cinema, I would have been disappointed. But as a Disney+ film, included with the subscription, I don't feel like I wasted my time.","12 March 2022",6,3,6
"Turning Red","I enjoy the majority of animated movies, in fact having kids was a great excuse to watch many. Unfortunately, this was one of the most painful experiences i have had with something that clearly has a reasonable budget. There were nearly no redeeming qualities. I was bored very quickly. My kids didn't enjoy it much either (one didn't sit through)","12 March 2022",3,12,32
"Turning Red","Wow! I am ashamed fro Disney-Pixar. The trailer was extremely misleading, so I began to watch the movie with my 6-year old niece and nephew. This movie isn't designed for entertainment rather to peddle the trash notion that the world needs to accept you for who you are even if you're a shrill, emotional, and mean girl. Silly.

The main primary problem the protagonist must overcome is laughable in a sad way, not a funny one. My how the mighty fall. I'll be pre-screening Disney and Pixar movies from now on before my kids see them. Sad to see them not only pushing poor morals, but they can't even do it with an interesting arc.","13 March 2022",1,18,39
"Turning Red","...this was an awkward movie to watch with little kids, it was particularly not fun watching it with my 8yo niece who didn't yet understand many of the themes of the film.

This movie has a target audience, but seems to be specifically girls only, and age 11+. No young boy will enjoy this film, and neither will a male adult. If you are one of those, and do enjoy it... well more power to you. Period jokes and and menstration as recurring theme (...the title anyone?), really made this unneedingly weird - and wow this movie was hyper from start to finish.

The jokes were not funny either, its that type of humor where someone being put in an awkward situation is supposed t0 he funny, I just it literally cringe inducing.","13 March 2022",2,13,31
"Turning Red","Something about this movie is so cringe lemons are embarrassed from this movie I wanted to throw up at the start and practiced mentally to watch this movie it's the results of a billion dollar company trying to relate but turning out to be embarrassing.","13 March 2022",1,16,34
"Turning Red","The potential of this story could have been delivered with a bit more honor and finesse towards the values of family, parents, the Asian culture community, and let's face it respect towards pre-teens struggles. It was a rude and ludicrous mockery, not to mention trashy choice of exaggerating emotion in all the wrong places.

If you want to teach your kids to devalue parents roles and importance, excuse bully like behavior, manipulations, sexualized behavior, rebellion for all the wrong reasons, and teach your kids to endanger themselves... then this is the shameful film for you.","15 March 2022",1,7,12
"Turning Red","I don't even feel like explaining everything that's wrong about this movie. The two main points are: (a) it's boring, really, really boring; and (b) it sends a bad message to kids. The latter is right for everything Americans have produced lately. Even when they're Chinese.","19 March 2022",2,9,28
"Turning Red","The story is a bit odd. I get that it's targeted to a younger audience but at time it feels trashy. I don't know how I feel about the mother being the villain, even if at the end she changes, it's been so overplayed. The trying to please the parents is so overdone in movies.

The style of characters is definitely not Pixar but props to them trying to switch it up, not sure I like it.

It's definitely a kids movie, it wasent boring but I'm sure I won't remember it. I had the same feeling with encanto.","13 March 2022",4,5,13
"Turning Red","I had fun watching it, not all jokes land but most of them are OK, the animation is good and the premise isnt anything new we hadnt seen in other films but it was still enjoyable.","12 March 2022",8,7,25
"Turning Red","Being an almost 40 year old man with a child, I often watch animated films and Pixar is nearly always an enjoyable way to waste a couple of hours.

Within 10 minutes I knew I was going to hate this film. It's got a deliberate target audience of pre-pubescent girls. The animation is superb but it has a weird anime-mimicking style that misses the mark completely. The script and jokes are weak and and the characters are mostly incredibly annoying.

Overall this just made me miss the late 90s / early 00s Pixar when the films they made were iconic. This is hyperactive yet drab and will likely be forgotten about quickly, like Coco or The Good Dinosaur.

Small girls on the cusp of womanhood will probably find a lot to identify with here.

Dads - it's not for you. Avoid.","16 March 2022",2,6,15
"Turning Red","I noticed a disturbing number of 1 star reviews complaining that they felt the movie was too woke or liberal. This review is intended to counterbalance that absurd line of logic and overall ignorance.

The movie was middle of the road by Disney standards, but pretty good overall. Not for really young kids, hence the PG rating.","13 March 2022",10,9,24
"Turning Red","This movie has fallen to the level of ""Only good for keeping your kids busy for a couple of hours while you take a nap.""

It has no substance. No deeper meanings. It doesn't make you think. Is it at least entertaining? Worth a few chuckles, but they really push the obnoxiousness and hyperactivity aimed directly at entertaining young children over creating a story or characters with any depth.

This one was incredibly disappointing and seemed more like a run of the mill DIsney movie than a Pixar film. Let me feeling really let down.","19 March 2022",1,7,15
"Turning Red","Wow this compared to UP , wall E is night and day .

I love Pixar but this is so poor , the story is poor I don't get what they was thinking .

I read a whole pack the people at Pixar are fed with there films going to Disney plus instead of the cinema and you can tell there fed up as it reflexes in this film .

If this want Pixar it would have been ripped to shreds on the reviews.","25 March 2022",3,6,14
"Turning Red","Movie is absurd, forced and a little too cliche or inspired. Completely predictable which wouldn't have been a problem if it was atleast wholesome.

I wish they made movies like they used to, even if it took them only 1 movie every 2 years.","16 March 2022",4,9,22
"Turning Red","This movie is not pleasent. I could live well enough alone for the premise, but, for how people went about promoting it, it cost the movie its value. I can't go into anything if it means rubbing elbows with unpleasant types that make up the majority, especially when I offer opinions to the contrary.

My biggest issue with the film is the arbitrary use of the year 2002. If you take that away, the core element of the film would not be lost, it would still be about a girl going through the throws of growing up and becoming a furry.

Also this has to be the ugliest Pixar movie I have ever seen, nothing like mugging the camera every few minutes.","2 May 2022",1,5,13
"Turning Red","I really enjoyed this movie! It had me laughing all throughout, and the songs are catchy as all get out too. It really reminded me of animation films from the 2000s and I think that's another reason why I immediately attached to it. Great watch!","13 March 2022",10,8,17
"Turning Red","A lot of the Disney/Pixar fare is usually pretty epic but I found this mediocre at best. The story, although loaded in cultural ideals and a little refreshing, felt very cookie cutter in execution. This was aimed a lot more towards children (12 and under) rather than having an equally entertaining level of value for the parents that have to sit through it. There is quite bit of cheese and it wasn't very funny at all. Thankfully it didn't turn into a musical but some of the aspects of childhood were spot on and for that it might be worth it for kids to watch.

5.5/10.","27 March 2022",5,2,4
"Turning Red","Don't be a nuckle dragging Neanderthal. 51% of the population has or will experience a period. So you, you whinny, white, shriveled, male idiots on here bombing the rating because you're either too immature or too stupid to even mention periods that, again, over half the population experiences. Which means if you have a kid, odds are that kid will experience a period you'll have to deal with. Grow the f up. Signed, a white male.","12 March 2022",10,12,27
"Turning Red","Pixar's newest film isn't bad at all but it doesn't really hold up to the studios other films. It's a good movie don't get me wrong but it wasn't super memorable. It was very sweet though. The characters are fun and it's a nice story about coming into your own and making your own decisions. The art style is different from Pixar but I did like it. I liked that it was different and that its character designs were unique compared to other Pixar films. The writing isn't anything too special. It services the story nicely but it doesn't really stand out in anything other than animation and character designs. The story was nice and sweet but I wasn't fully engaged with it. The film was also kind of annoying to sit through for the first 30 minutes but it got better as it went along. The voice acting is pretty good. I can't pinpoint one performance that I loved or hated. Everyone did a good job. The humor definitely was hit or miss. When it landed, it really landed. The film can be REALLY funny sometimes but other times the jokes just didn't work. The animation is beautiful as always. The environments looked gorgeous. Even though I wasn't fully engaged with this, it was still a fun time. I would recommend checking this out if you like Pixar or want something a little different from them.","22 March 2022",7,4,12
"Turning Red","I have not laughed this much at a movie for so long. And amongst all the laughters, Pixar's still managed to put its signature magical touch of depth into this heartfelt masterpiece.","21 March 2022",10,3,6
"Turning Red","I never laughed like this in years! The fun and adorable moments, the drama and about girls when becoming teenagers challenge. The scenario and everything was perfect and spot on. FORGET THE BORING BATMAN THAT GIVES YOU DEPRESSION AND ARTHRITIS for sitting 3 hours lol.","10 March 2022",10,34,119
"Turning Red","The Good: I'm going to get this out of the way; I'm a Torontonian. As such, you can expect a healthy dose of appreciation for this film's existence as a glorious ode to the city circa 2002. We got Vince Carter, the Skydome, the old TTC logo...what bliss.

One of the best things about this movie is its attention to detail and visual style. There are so many beautiful details in the background and the animation is honestly quite stunning. It's bright, vibrant, colourful, yet kinetic and hard to look away from. Nothing groundbreaking, just very solid and at times, it looks more Ghibli than the recent CG Ghibli movie was.

The film feels like an East meets West not just thematically, but visually. The exaggerated facial expressions, emotions, and movements, hyper quick editing and swooping camera are reminiscent of comedic anime. Yet, the movie is firmly rooted in the moral lessons and tone that you'd expect from Western animation.

This might be Pixar's funniest movie in quite a while. The movie is actually pretty open about puberty and feels like it was written by people who remember what it was like to be 13 years old. For instance, the school's reaction to Meilin's Panda seems...more realistic than what most films would imagine. And it's a nice change that puts a spin on the typical ""I need to hide my secret"" plot and frankly, more fun.

The Bad: The movie is formulaic to a fault. I mean aside from that one (admittedly major) plot element I referenced above, everything that happens here is very predictable. There aren't a lot of chances taken with the narrative and I fear this is one of those movies that people will end up forgetting about a few days or weeks after seeing it.

I also found the beginning portion of the film to be a bit grating; the tone and style are pretty in your face and the movie starts off extremely quickly and almost obnoxiously. I didn't get good vibes from the ""I'm Meilin Lee"" opening narrative, but the movie picks up. I also felt the finale was a bit overdone, remisicent of the big Marvel finales. Not *every* movie needs this sort of final Act. It wasn't bad or anything, just a bit disappointing.

The Ugly: Turning Red is a pretty solid movie that I'd recommend to just about anyone. It does a good job explore the nuances of the cultural clash that many of us can relate to, manages to blend animation styles extremely well, and is just a lot of fun. This movie's energy and humour is infectious. Check it out!","15 March 2022",7,5,17
"Turning Red","Make your unhappy life even more unpleasant in this movie. Chinese family relationships are very complicated, and the key to resolving conflicts must be love and understanding. I regret that I did not see these in this film.","12 March 2022",2,9,18
"Turning Red","The writer honestly think that a girl in her 13rd year should live without her parents guidance and should be considered an adult?!, Where's the world coming to?","1 April 2022",1,15,35
"Turning Red","I wouldn't choose to watch this again. I didn't feel drawn into the story at any point, it felt awkward and I wasn't really sold on the plot. It's really just aimed at preteens. It's obviously about girls 'coming of age' but I think it could have been done a lot better.

The only one in my family that enjoyed it was my 8 year old but I think the story mostly went over her head and she just liked that the main character turned into a panda. My 4 year old got bored very quickly.

Not a family film we will bother watching again.","12 March 2022",3,9,21
"Turning Red","As an avid supporter of animation works, I have always been an advocate of Pixar's specific means of storytelling, where the narrative and the characters take precedence over the rest. For this past decade, I have seen Pixar thrive with its consecutive endeavours. I've been an onlooker on their voyage towards adapting to the necessary changes, the all-important diversity; and this film yet again proved to be the next step in the right direction.

Domie Shee's debut directorial (A brilliant one in that BTW) ""Turning Red"" is unique, it's quite different from what Pixar had done in recent times. It's offbeat, a bit odd at times, but the thing is; The film is incredibly self-aware of its distinctiveness. Hence, the story gleefully embraces all the weirdness and the oddities.

The narrative talks of mainly two things, one is about the 'inner beasts' that we all human beings deal with, which we all tend to have deep inside our minds. And two, the hardships endured by a child in his/her pre-teen phase as well as the parents who have to bear the responsibility to strike a healthy harmony between being a parent and being a 'friend'.

The first steps into teenagehood, the ride could get a little bumpy. With thousands of thoughts, emotions in your senses, with millions of hormones running down your veins; it often gets difficult to convey our sentiments, desires, the ambitions we yearn for. So much so, that we frequently feel suffocated, burdened by how we 'must' carry ourselves in front of other people.

Family plays a crucial part in the said process. If somebody has a similar set of tough pair of parents as Mei Mei (Asians would relate); this can get too demanding for the child. Pixar does a great job sending out the statement to reconcile, to have an understanding, from both sides of the spectrum.

They encourage the parents to engage in a mutual, civilised discussion with their children about the transformations they are about to go through. Now, 'Turning Red' doesn't endorse the idea of abandonment. Just because you have a different personality, a different set of views on certain matters doesn't mean you have to be a rebel, you don't need to be one, there are other ways, there's always a choice!

It can all be settled through mutual dialogue and respect. The film just wants the youngsters to understand the other side of the perspective too. The same goes vice-versa. Parents need to acknowledge the confusion, the conflict their child is growing through at that particular age. They have all come past that turbulent stage of life, they should know better, right?

Well, it seems like I had told you enough about the connotation. Now we should discuss a little about the other facets as well! Technically, it's exceptional work. Not a surprise to be honest! The animations, the visuals, the colours; it was full of vibrance and vigour. The Score on the other hand wasn't anything special, yet it had its own charisma and presence. Dubbing is again remarkably done by the respective artists.

Even though the characters are adorable, they are endearing; there is a clear inadequacy in their individual developments. Being the central figures, both Mei and Ming got the leverage and had a better write-up on their side. Unlike the rest of the ensemble, where most of the characters happen to have minor importance.

Nevertheless, at the end of the day, the story takes the cake. Despite a few drawbacks I very much enjoyed my time with it. At first, I wasn't convinced, I'm certain, you would feel the same. The reason being, as part of the audience, whenever we hear the name ""Pixar"" we tune in with a preconceived notion, a premeditated belief about how their films 'should turn out' but that coerced view may as well reshape, as the change is right here, right now, for better or worse.","15 March 2022",8,8,35
"Turning Red","Having a 13 year girl of my own this movie opened up so much inside me and I cried a lot in the end. Truly amazing story and portrait about motherhood as well as growing up and breaking free.","11 March 2022",10,11,24
"Turning Red","First off, I love Disney films. I think they have so much charm, and the characters are often relatable.

I really can't say that about this movie - and before you roll your eyes, I'm Asian too.

I don't really like the 'Westernization' of the stereotypes that they portrayed here. The parents using language that just doesn't fit a 'fob' family (i.e. ""delinquents""). The only truly likeable character was the dad. Everyone else was basically a spoiled 'perfect' brat that hadn't gotten over their maturity issues.

The overprotective mom is a thing, but there was no reason for Mei Mei to remain popular, given how outlandish the entire family behaved. The 'jokes' were so cringey. I'm really surprised they made it through quality assurance. I honestly could tell you that I chuckled maybe two times the entire movie. I was so bored, and I really wanted it to end.

4Town wasn't bad, but they were a useless part of the movie. They represented nothing meaningful to the main characters. And the mom exposing pictures to people - god, that would never have happened. If the writers had any clue about Asian culture, it's that they'd keep that stuff INSIDE - NEVER exposing it.

If you talked back at your Asian parents like that, you'd be disowned. Shame to the Asian family would be grounds for that.

I truly cannot recommend this movie at all. It's likely my 1 time that I vote this a 1 - and I love all sorts of movies.","21 March 2022",1,8,19
"Turning Red","Let me just save you the time and tell you straight up, this was garbage! It didn't even seem like it was a Pixar. I wasn't a huge fan of Coco; however, it has a lot of things I appreciate about Pixar. This had none. This movie was absolute trash. The best part about it all is that Disney knows that too because they didn't release it in theaters. It would've bombed big time. Don't waste your time. It was boring as all get out. It had little to no humor. And the story was a convoluted mess. I won't even get it into all the garbage they included in the movie.","14 March 2022",1,16,37
"Turning Red","Made an account to register how cringy this film was for me on the internet. Ew. Just. Hated it so hard. It's not because I don't believe in it's message, it's because I think it's presentation was unnecessarily uncomfortable and weird.","16 March 2022",1,11,23
"Turning Red","Was the first thing that popped into my head.

What's with the incredible awkward dialogue and over the top ""quirky"" characters. What type of kids are they trying to relate to with this movie. I watched this with a couple of nieces and nephews as I thought being in their early teens they might enjoy it but they were just rolling their eyes from start to finish.","16 April 2022",3,5,15
"Turning Red","Okay, so maybe I sound a little bit dramatic but I'm perhaps the result of what happens if you lose yourself and only do what your parents do- which is the total antithesis of this story. I lose almost all of my friends because of overbearing and overprotective parents, I have no personality and express myself through a character that lets me be at least an inkling of who I really am- which is why this movie kinda hit hard for me, because it is what I should've done but never had the strength to do. I am now 26 and I've lost most of the good friends that I've had and have a hard time retaining acquaintances even, I'm expendable in any friend group and I honestly regret ""doing what's right"" instead of honouring myself and my own emotions, which is why this movie kinda hit hard for me- I'm sorry if this turned out a bit dark for a kid's movie but it's my true emotions and I'm a bit triggered honestly, in a good way.

So to first counter all the criticisms I've seen put hyperbolically on the internet- first regarding the art style- if you see it in stills and memes it kinda looks awful but once you see it in the movie it actually makes sense- it is definitely the amalgamation of anime and western cartoons being mixed into one, very ""CalArts"" but at the same time it's its own thing and I like it- especially the more ""anime"" it goes the more fun and dynamic it feels- all of the characters have their own distinct and unified look which is fun and vibrant and sometimes simplistic, don't care and just let go of all of it and have fun!

Another criticism I've seen of it is that it's ""not relatable"" or ""anti-parents"" which is such a bad take. Art if it is to be enjoyed has no duty to be relatable, and if it's a totally alien situation to who you are as a person- try to use empathy, that can do you good sometimes, either way you can consume and enjoy art even if you're not the target audience. And about the whole anti-parents thing... if anything this is super pro-parents, because it implores people that you should have boundaries even with your kids and your kids should respect you as well as your parents should respect you, the outcome of this can only be a good one but people treat the message as if it's the end of civilisation. I really connected with this story, of having overbearing parents who crave the world and everything from you but you just seem to never be enough, not to anyone, not even your parents... I wish I had this movie as a kid honestly, then perhaps my life would've been so much better. Just to enforce the message of the movie, the character Mei-Mei literally embraces her ancestors in the story and that's super pro-parents if anything. Also it's okay to have friends and they can be your extended family, I wish I had such a group of friends just like Mei-Mei, I have friends that only care a little about me whenever I contact them, it's never the other way around, it's always I that has to maintain all the friendships around my life yet I've gained none of them cause they all count me out and I'm never in their thoughts. Which is why watching this movie kind of made me sad, but in a good way! If I can't have that in real life at least I can forget about my own life and live vicariously through this in 1 hr 46 mins which helps

The music is fun, it is part of the story in both a diegetic and a non-diegetic sort of way which I love! Also the backdrop of it being around the 90s and 00s, this is the first piece of media that I've encountered that paints this time in such a romantic and fun way- it makes me feel right at home cause it's my childhood.

All in all it's a good movie, a great one even- it's not as awful as moralists and weird memers make it out to be. It hits right at home and it touches upon important messages of growing up and just living life, getting your own identity- own up to your emotions and wear them with pride! Sometimes you have to break free from the ones that love you, but that doesn't mean that you should disrespect them (this movie doesn't imply that btw) but the people that love you should give you space to nurture yourself and grow up the person that you always wanted to be. Look at me, I still live at home with my parents and nary a courage to say what I want from my life- so I waste away trying to complete this awful university program that has eaten away a large chunk of my twenties and made me feel miserable and hopeless, I'm stuck, and I've never been anything else- the only thing that gives me happiness is the consuming of media such as music and movies and some other stuff. So please, if you're younger or if you're in my same situation but have a form of escape just please do what you must to follow your own heart and dreams- parents will always love you no matter what, they'll understand eventually- don't suffer like me, don't lose your friendships in order to make your parents happy and maintain their high expectations of you, just be you.","25 March 2022",10,5,15
"Turning Red","The main character is supposed to be 13 but she acts like a 6 year old. The mother is domineering to the point of child abuse. This movie is not appropriate for 9 year olds as it has themes of puberty and menstruation. There is violence. I'm shocked by it. My 13 year old wanted us to turn it off half way through. Whomever wrote the script is not a parent, the immense pressure the child is put under is nauseating to watch.","17 March 2022",2,6,14
"Turning Red","This movie was a huge disappointment for my family. The messages of exploiting your body for money, knowing more than your parents, lying being good, sneaking out and going to a concert without parental knowledge, etc., all at the age of 13 was inappropriate. Some of the messages could be dangerous in real life and there are better ways to address those issues. To be honest, I was shocked that Pixar was behind this film. It didn't have any of the normal emotion and the humor fell flat for our family.

I did add a star for the diversity, which was really nice to see in a main film.","12 March 2022",2,15,33
"Turning Red","I'm usually not a big fan of animation movies and the last film of the genre that I would truly consider excellent is Wall-E with its outstanding characters, stunning locations and essential environmental messages. I coincidentally watched parts of Turning Red when I visited a friend whose two-year old daughter is a big fan of the movie and I really appreciated what I saw. When I took the plane a few days later, I decided to watch the entire film and my positive first impressions were not only met but even exceeded.

There are several elements that make this film stand out. First and foremost, it talks about accepting yourself the way you are, with all your strengths and weaknesses. This empowering message is more important than ever in a time when many people have developed mental health issues during the ongoing pandemic. This lesson is valuable and timeless, making it a movie anyone should be able to empathize with.

Up next, this film combines Canadian and Chinese cultures. These are two of the most fascinating cultures in our world in my book and I state this as a German. Canada represents democracy, equality, freedom, multiculturalism and nature like no other country in the world. Chinese culture on the other side is incredibly varied, rich, creative, colourful and ancient. Discovering different elements of both cultures at the same time in this film is like traveling to new exotic places while our movements are limited, opening your mind without having to listen to a dry class and dreaming yourself far away as you are watching the movie go by in the blink of an eye.

The characters are particularly charming as well. If you think that this film is rather for girls because the main characters are female, you have got it all wrong since the characters' challenges, dreams and experiences in their teenage years are something any teenager or adult can relate to and any baby or child could already learn about. You will be rooting for these quirky characters while they are going through challenging changes.

The plot itself is also quite interesting and mixes comedy, drama and fantasy in equal part, making this a highly entertaining coming-of-age film dealing with topics such as family, friendship, identity, liberty and loyalty. The overarching theme could also be described as emancipation or finding your true self.

At the end of the day, Turning Red is an absolutely timeless coming-of-age film with wonderful characters, locations and morals that could be watched by anyone from a toddler over a child to a teenager, an adult or even elderly people. Few movies manage to entertain, inspire and touch such a vast audience. If you haven't watched Turning Red yet, make sure to give it a shot as this is a solid candidate for best movie of the year.","6 September 2022",9,2,5
"Turning Red","Having a 9+ rating was the first sign of confusion. For a very young style used in the animation I was then not sure whether to show it to my child. Immediately instincts were correct as there are teenage references with language, puberty, boy-obsessed stereotypes etc. I can't see if this had had a theatrical release that it would have been met with much approval from parents who gladly take young ones to PGS, (eg Moana which is a 6+ On Disney)
To rate this against their best films, Toy Story etc, it falls shorts on expectations and fails to deliver an exciting plot, depth in character development and overall intelligence.","12 March 2022",3,4,8
"Turning Red","If you what to teach your girls about their periods go for it. Otherwise, skip it.

Very disappointed that this wasn't a story for all children watching.","12 March 2022",1,23,62
"Turning Red","This movie is garbage. First the actual animation is gross, these woke stories are just soo annoying. There is zero plot and characters are trash. Those 10 min animation shorts are 1000 times better than this full animated movie.","19 June 2022",1,7,17
"Turning Red","The beginning of the movie wasn't awful. It was a little slow , but anyone who has ever been a preteen could relate to a lot of those scenes.

Then it got really weird.

Most of the movie was spent sneaking out at night , lying to parents , selling photos of themselves ..
and all these behaviors are shown as the right thing to do and the parents trying to keep her safe as the bad thing.

Yea. The mother was crazy over protective.

But

If you knew your daughter would turn into a giant angry panda , you probably would. There was no "" oh. Now we understand each other"" moment like most kids movies usually have

Nope. We get her being a furry!! Which , sorry. No thank you. Certainly do not think that should be celebrated in a film for small children.","10 June 2022",1,5,14
"Turning Red","This is what happens when a company is in bed with China, China hates the US so it's based in Canada, and with a usual dusting of wokeness. I don't know who this movie is aimed at but it's all over the place. From weird tampon references to pathetic weak male characters, this film ticked every tokenistic box while suckling the teet of a Chinese audience. It seems Pixar either makes amazing movies or the opposite, this being the latter. It started off interesting, then went from bad to worse. The ending was predictable from the mid-point. I won't be watching this again.","13 March 2022",2,11,30
"Turning Red","A masterpiece for all the families an oscar Diamond...!!!I love red pandas I love pixar I love Disney. He first Disney all-female creative team is behind this movie. It shows in its exploration of girlhood, motherhood, and the relationship between a young girl and her overprotective mother. And it's not a critique as much as a celebration of the process. Addressing issues of identity, belonging, generational trauma, friendship, and mother-daughter relations, this is undoubtedly a movie that will connect with people. Don't be surprised if it makes you stop and say, ""Hey, that's me!"" several times while watching it!","11 March 2022",10,26,65
"Turning Red","I'm not going to use terms like ""woke"" or ""inappropriate"" like some of the other reviews. I'll just say that Disney/ Pixar usually creates films that are fairly well received by people of all ages (for the most part). I can only imagine this was done by the C squad writers and was added to Disney+ and not in theaters for a reason. It was straight cheeks.","17 March 2022",2,8,20
"Turning Red","Nice movie especially for young girls :-)

While to me Pixar has mostly not been back to full form after Toy Story 4, the animation is still top notch. The characters and fantasy scenarios are interesting, but the comedy and total execution have still not gotten back to the level of excellence of the Pixar classics :-(","12 March 2022",7,10,46
"Turning Red","While I can't relate to most of the adolescent-related problems experienced by Mei Mei, ""Turning Red"" is still a delightful family film even if it doesn't rank as one of Pixar's best.","12 March 2022",7,13,65
"Turning Red","We really tried to have fun with the movie, but after 30 minutes we decided that none of us wanted to watch it. We didn't even bother to check how it ended.","28 May 2022",1,4,8
"Turning Red","While I respect the floral metaphors, I don't think I've ever seen a movie that talked so much, nor so explicitly, about the details of a 13-year-old's labia.

And this is a movie for kids.

UPDATE: I made it slightly further into the movie. Do the filmmakers genuinely not know what red pandas are? Do they think they're the same size as pandas? Red pandas are tiny! I'm so confused. Or rather, the filmmakers are. I just can't, with this movie.","3 April 2022",,4,12
"Turning Red","Movie was so nice and has many messages and heart warming. I like all the characters in movie no one is annoying. I like mei and her 4 friends and her mother.

Also, movie is so hilarious.","11 March 2022",10,20,49

"Turning Red","Really wanted to enjoy this film but it just fell flat.

The story line could have been great but unfortunately it just didn't deliver. Will be a fun watch for the kids though as bright colours and loud noises abound.","15 March 2022",1,10,20
"Turning Red","The first part of the story had a lot of potential for a great and positive message about comunication with parents, but it went down with the plot, turning into ""Do what ever you want with your desitions and your live, you are a 13 years old ADULT"" Soooo Wrong. Thats part of the degradation of our society. These big media industries should be ashamed.","20 March 2022",1,11,21
"Turning Red","It's a movie about a girls period. That was the overarching theme. Pretty bottom of the barrel for Disney. There are a million ways to spend an evening with your family. Don't waste your time with this.","19 March 2022",1,12,27
"Turning Red","It was a car crash from the beginning. Followed the ambulance to the ER just to see if they survived. Basically a PG period party. Awkward from beginning to end.","13 March 2022",1,14,29
"Turning Red","Pixar's Turning Red features stunning animation, and includes some innovative camerawork and cool ideas for displaying teenage emotion visually. However, from the start, there is a lack of finesse, whether it be the integration of the core themes (puberty, over-controlling parents), or the dialogue.

1. My bad script alarms went off during the first lines of the movie, which is a mini narration by the main character, describing the entire theme of the movie like a topic sentence of a middle school essay.

2. Pixar took a lot of the comedic stylings and animation quirks of a Phil Lord and Christopher Miller film, and integrated only the annoying parts.

3. Climax of the movie was predictable after watching the first ten minutes.

4. I have a feeling people will use the themes of puberty and emotion to justify the lack of a cohesive tone, and this makes me angry.

5. There is nothing wrong with the themes themselves, but I expect a better script from Pixar.","13 March 2022",4,4,10
"Turning Red","Honestly not even remotely good. I could see this being a Dreamworks movie, but Pixar should be held to such a higher standard. The last four years I'm just not feeling them anymore. I wouldn't say it's pandering... but it's just not great in the least.","12 March 2022",1,16,33
"Turning Red","I am a college student. Watched this with a bunch of my buddies. As we watched it we kept having to hit pause because of how ridiculous scenes were. I mean we are young adults so obviously those scenes are acceptable. But for anyone young watching this, it is just outright inappropriate. My parents would never have let me watched this growing up. As I watched this movie I thought that Disney/Pixar was trying so hard to appeal to a teenage audience, like their target market was tweens. (Just like the main characters) either way I don't know how they can sell this as a Pixar/Disney movie that toddlers are supposed to be able to watch. Needless to say there is no way my children will watch this until they are in middle school. And if it counts for anything the movie itself was cute and funny at times. Just ridiculously inappropriate.","17 March 2022",2,7,17
"Turning Red","Like alot of new animated movie it was pretty mediocre. The story was bland and the end felt very unsatisfying. The characters where bad like the mom. I understand that it's supposed to be character development but it made me cringe a lot and it's also very unsatisfying when she mistake things for things. Don't waste your like unless you enjoy these types of movies.","19 March 2022",2,4,8
"Turning Red","Awesome family dynamics, and really well demonstrated the old/new generation dilemma without hammering either side in. Normalization of the more ugly side of adolescence is probably the best thing about this movie, along with the diversity and cultural aesthetic. I will admit there were a lot of moments that gave me enough secondhand embarrassment to cause goosebumps, though.","20 March 2022",7,5,20
"Turning Red","It was a very lighthearted, yet deep, movie.

Watch it for: Animation, the cultural story, relatability, comedy, voice acting, so much floof.

Fun and entertaining, short movie ~1.5 hrs. There's a lot more to take away from the movie if you can relate.","14 March 2022",7,5,18
"Turning Red","It was a heart-warming film. I've seen people bash it before it even came out so my expectations were a little low, but it was undeserved.

It really is a wonderful movie. There isn't an actual antagonist, which I like - it's about family, friendship, perspective and growing up.

It just happens to involve a mystical red panda.","11 March 2022",8,11,31
"Turning Red","Pixar what the f is this? Not appropriate for children. Preteens and teens, yes. 5 year olds? No. This movie is creepy and weird. Disney is getting too into the indoctrination narrative. Creepy, creepy, creepy. Plus, the metaphor of getting a period is horribly portrayed.","12 March 2022",1,20,48
"Turning Red","I love Pixar movies but honestly this didn't feel like a Pixar movie. The animation was horrible and felt like some small studio made it. Then the story was so awkward i had to pause and walk away for a bit. I don't even remember laughing at any part of the story.

The theme is good, but i have heard it told better before.","14 March 2022",2,7,24
"Turning Red","It definitely looks like a lot of work went into this, but I think they tried too hard to make it relatable. Mei is supposed to be a fun and dorky character, but she ends up acting like a surly, immature, sexually advanced 13-year old.","18 March 2022",1,8,15
"Turning Red","Tied with Cars 3 as the worst Pixar movie. The main issue (and there are many issues) is that all the characters are annoying and unlikable. I see what they were trying to go for here, but the emotional/family dynamic issues were inexplicably both overwrought and underdeveloped. An absolute mess that my whole family thought was terrible. And believe it or not, I enjoyed it more than my kids or wife.","13 March 2022",3,9,20
"Turning Red","Don't understand how this isn't rated higher, it's a big shift from normal Pixar movies but I love it. The message is cute but the comedic moments is what makes this so great!","24 March 2022",10,8,17
"Turning Red","I can't even believe this is from the makers of the Great Wall E.

This is a story about a young unattractive girl that thinks only cute boys are worth it.

Oh and she turns into a giant Teddy bear for some reason.

You might like this if you are a girl age 10-13. I really hope this is not what 13 year olds think like.

Worst animation I've ever seen in the past 35 years.

Pixar is dead.","20 March 2022",3,6,19
"Turning Red","This movie was pushing the liberal agenda onto little kids and it was impossible to stomach. I wanted to like this movie. I wanted my kids to see tampons and pads and normalize that sort of stuff but the whole ""my panda my choice"" and other things to that affect were so offensive to me we had to turn it off and talk to our kids about it afterwords. I strongly advice you to watch something else.","19 March 2022",1,12,27
"Turning Red","My kids love red pandas. We would make special trips when the local zoo had red panda events. Disney/Pixar needs to release an apology to the red panda community.

Don't waste your family time on this disaster.","5 April 2022",2,5,9
"Turning Red","Pixar is going down, the worst movie ever from the bad characters to the worst story.

A lot of hidden messages, absolutely not for kids;
Disobeying your own family so you can be your true self, and love your friends more than your parents. Wow !!!! What a humanitarian value to show it to our kids.

I am with encouraging the kids to make their own choices but not like this.","18 March 2022",3,8,21
"Turning Red","From the common to tiny detail of asian family? Checked.

A great emotion of each character, colorful both in view and characteristic? Checked.

A detail motion move from a adorable red panda, and also dope move too at the same time? Checked.

Well write, Fresh style, being first 'wave' movie after long specific famous style is not going be easy, but this movie nailed it with much other good elements.

Also, what up with that cooking scene? That can be a whole different movie. Dang that's good.","13 March 2022",8,8,36
"Turning Red","This spoke to me on a personal level. I'm not going to say it was perfect by any means, but it was REALLY good.

Negatives:
The narration was a bit much, honestly. The art style was a little confused. The fact that he subtitles referred to anything vaguely Chinese as ""soft traditional music"" was reductive.

Positives:
The art style was expressive and fun. The metaphorical representation was solid. The cultural representation was AMAZING; Sikhs, Cantonese, Koreans, a diabetic, pretty sure Tyler's dad was black Caribbean but it all felt natural.

All in all, A- movie. I had a good time.","17 March 2022",8,4,12
"Turning Red","And it finally happened, both Disney and Pixar have tilted so far left they completely alienated 75% of their fan base. Why am I having to explain menstruation to little boys? Ruining Star Wars, Marvel, Muppets and everything else all for the mighty wokeness points.... Keep it up, you'll have no fans left at all.","19 March 2022",1,9,23
"Turning Red","We were so excited to watch this with our 6 year old daughter when we first heard about it, but Disney/Pixar really screwed up with this movie. They should have said that this movie is not meant for young kids but more geared toward older children. We turned it off after maybe 15 minutes.","13 March 2022",1,17,36
"Turning Red","Just truly awful. Disney has been smashing it out of the park recently with Coco, Soul, Encanto etc. But this feels like a major step backwards. The only positive thing I can say is that the animation looks really good. No storyline whatsoever, annoying characters and a bad soundtrack. Thank god this came out straight on Disney plus, otherwise I might have wasted time and money actually going to the cinema.","13 March 2022",1,12,26
"Turning Red","This movie didn't touch me emotionally as much as it could have. The main reason is that it is unclear why the panda needs to be stopped.

Almost every single experience Mei has as a panda is positive. Her friends love it, her schoolmates love it, it gives her strength to stand up to bullies. All of this makes us hard to understand the perspective of her mom. It makes the drama between them emotionless because it's black and white. It essentially boils down to this: parents = strict = they don't get it = they're bad.

Compare this to a previous Pixar film, Finding Nemo. In the beginning we see Marlin lose his whole family. After that, he's overprotective. There's understanding here. We emotionally understand why Marlin is anxious. We also understand why Nemo wants to be free. We understand the drama, and are emotionally moved when it's resolved at the end.

Turning Red doesn't have that. We never think Ming has a reasonable position. Ming is always the one that needs to change and accept Mei. That might be what they're going for, but it sure does make for a tepid story.

But let's play a game of what-if. Imagine how much more heartfelt and deeper this story would've been if we saw glimpses of when Ming was a child. Imagine if we saw Ming born after her parents immigrated to Toronto. Imagine if we saw Ming become a panda and, in contrast to Mei's experience, was actually rebuked by her schoolmates and friends. Let's say people weren't as accepting then and so the correct strategy was to bury it. And now, with those experiences in mind, she tries to pass those strategies onto Mei which fails.

That all probably wouldn't track with the metaphor of the panda being puberty and stuff. And it would maybe change the soul of the movie. But I can personally say it'd be more engaging for me than watching white winning over black.","11 March 2022",6,1,1
"Turning Red","Turning Red

March 11, 2022 (USA)

Director: Domee Shi

Genre: Comedy, Animation, Adventure

Where to watch: Disney plus

DURATION: 1 hour 40 minutes.

Pixar's first feature film directed entirely by a woman (Domee Shi), is an allegory towards the transition of adolescence and a fun adventure that involves friendship, mother-daughter relationship and the search for identity from a female perspective.

With notable references to 2000s culture, ""Turning Red"" serves as a tribute to Chinese traditions and Canadian society. An emotional and fun experience that addresses issuaes such as puberty (menstruation), appearances, the true nature of people, etc. In such a friendly and perfectly balanced way, that it makes it one of the smartest children's films of recent years. (Filled with nods to other Pixar movies)

""Pixar doesn't disappoint, it reinvents itself and builds a completely satisfying story.""","24 March 2022",8,3,7
"Turning Red","It was a very nice movie, very funny
Great characters
You will not bored a second
I wanted to rate it 8 but my kids rate it 10😅
We all loved it.

It has good messages For kids and parents.","10 March 2022",10,26,59
"Turning Red","I guess I'm the only person who thought that the character was an annoying brat and that this film was boring. I understand it's symbolism for womanhood but as a grown woman myself I thought this was stupid. Sorry.","2 April 2022",5,3,7
"Turning Red","As always, pixar gives us another cute and adorable new movie, but this time with a twist. We follow Mei, this 13 year old girl that is going through puberty and plus, she becomes an adorable red panda every time she gets stressed, angry or excited.

This is a beautiful metaphor that describes the horrible and great teenage years. It depicts healthy friendships and the complicated relationship between mother and daughters.

Didn't make me cry, like other pixar films did, but it warmed my heart.","14 March 2022",7,4,13
"Turning Red","Look, not the best Disney/Pixar film that I've watched. It wasn't horrible but it wasn't great. I found myself getting a bit bored. Has a good story line but just a bit long and had this ""nothingness"" about it. Let's just say I wouldn't watch it again in a hurry. .","18 April 2022",4,2,4
"Turning Red","I'm a huge Disney and Pixar fan. Huge Animation films fan, and a huge boy band fan as well! So i was beyond excited for this movie....

But this movie made me feel so uncomfortable watching it, seriously the second hand emberesment is REAL. I wish I could go back and unwatch it.

It pains me to write this cos I love Disney and Pixar. But this is NOT A GOOD FILM AT ALL.","18 March 2022",1,7,15
"Turning Red","I never leave reviews because who has time to write 8 paragraphs about a goddamn Disney movie but this is ridiculous. I swept through the 1 star reviews and they're all ADULTS complaining about this movie being related to periods like what type of immature stuff is that?? 'I had to explain what periods are to my son' like he was gonna find out regardless. LMAO go get a job.

The movie was cute and was about healing generational trauma as well as understanding puberty. There's been so many movies with the concept of puberty anyways and this is the one y'all are upset about? Ridiculous.","19 March 2022",8,7,13
"Turning Red","Our kids wanted to watch this the second time, and we (the parents) were promised we would definitely love it. The oldest boy warned we should prepare for a cringe fest beyond compare, and he was not even sure if he would be able to sit through a second watching. (He wasn't.) But we can't wait for the day he will be able to digest this movie's message in full. A truly remarkable achievement from Pixar (again). This movie represents many good talking points for closing gaps in understanding between generations, genders, and cultures. Entertaining on multiple levels, making it very enjoyable for the adults as well.","20 March 2022",10,3,6
"Turning Red","One of the Most Profound Utilization of the Computer-Artist Combining the Emergence of the Digital Platform and Human Imagination...

"Turning Red","The latest from Pixar from earlier this year. When a Chinese Canadian (hey now that's different!) young girl's anxieties transform her into a giant red panda (something which apparently afflicts all the women in her family) so when scholastic endeavors & an impending boy band concert loom on the horizon, our heroine just can't handle the pressure bringing on the change (is the panda a big metaphor for menstruation?). W/the girl's mother desperate to keep the bear at bay she reunites all the women in the family to perform a ritual which will quell the beast but will our little woman go through the ceremony? Probably the easiest of plots by far in the usually dense original tales Pixar dwells in which affords much mileage from poking fun at domineering Asian parental units, the toils of academia & burgeoning sexuality which may be a turnoff to the target audience but I was kind of nonplussed as the message kept getting sidetracked by the over-caffeinated & loud shenanigans of the youngsters on display but it's better than the usual dreck the other studios put out even though it may be a worthy effort, it ultimately wasn't my particular cup of tea.","1 August 2022",6,1,2
"Turning Red","My family always looks forward to watching the newest released Disney movies Onward, Encanto (have rewatched it 20 times over already), but this movie I felt was bad.

I began watching it with my family and friend's family; I felt like I was watching a Wallace and Gromit film and I just couldn't get past how obnoxious it was (even Raya and the Last Dragon I could get past the annoying dragon and finish the film).

Unfortunately 30 min in I had to step out and let the kids finish it alone; my brain couldn't take it. Then I came back towards the end and half the kids left and the others weren't paying and abandoned the movie to play minecraft on their iPads.

Won't be returning to rewatch.","24 March 2022",4,6,14
"Turning Red","A much needed movie for young girls/kids going through their changes. Cute, funny, and heartwarming. Those of you who call this ""woke"" maybe it will help you listen to your kids better and be there for them.","13 March 2022",9,8,22
"Turning Red","Even this is an animation cartoon; but so flexible and so real to show that the actual life of teenage girl with their family. A good film watch together with your children.","20 March 2022",10,3,6
"Turning Red","Bloody brillant i absolutely love it and my kids i love the way she dances and grooves to the music its great wicked personality who ever thought of this film are genuis best film yet.","23 March 2022",10,7,13
"Turning Red","As someone from Asia, the movie portrays the culture of a Asian family in a very accurate way. I can resonate the way I was raised up with the character in so many ways.","12 March 2022",10,7,19
"Turning Red","I was a bit irritated in the beginning, if I would like the characters and style, also I wasn't blown away with the trailer, but it's overall really funny, super super cute, full of emotions and topped with an important message. Highly recommended!","21 March 2022",9,3,7
"Turning Red","The worst movie in the history of Pixar. I just liked the animation. I only finished 50 minutes of the movie and I couldn't stand the amount of stupidity.","23 June 2022",2,5,9
"Turning Red","I'd rate it zero if I could. Not a good plot or cast of characters. Don't waste your time on this one. The main character seems totally out of touch with reality and what being a teenager now is actually like.","5 May 2022",1,6,14
"Turning Red","If I had kids I wouldn't show them this movie, it seems as though this generation is trying to change good values and make it okay to have bad ones. That's backward progress.","1 June 2022",1,4,13
"Turning Red","This movie is hilariously bad. Acting, animation, characters, story. Nothing works. It is so incredibly generic, and yet it can't even do a generic story well.

At least Tyler (who I am convinced is a reference to Ninja, seriously, same name and look-what the heck?) is an okay character.","13 March 2022",2,8,20
"Turning Red","7/10 - the best Pixar movie since Onward (which wasn't that long ago but feels like an eternity) brings a little bit maturity and nuance, but I still feel like that third act could have been workshopped a bit more.","19 March 2022",7,7,38
"Turning Red","Weird animation, weird casting and weird ending, but the panda is really cute. Bidadari Yang Terluka is a good movie from Indonesia. Sorry Disney and Pixar.","1 May 2022",3,3,7
"Turning Red","Very entertaining, beautiful animated, funny, I loved it. Mei Mei has a beautiful voice - great job Rosalie Chiang! - the red panda is adorable...
It has music, message, loud and emotional moments, it has everything! Turning Red is an incredible debut for Domee Shi. It's beautifully made, sharply written and just as instantly lovable as it is adorable as its big fuzzy lead. :)","10 March 2022",10,20,46
"Turning Red","Definitely not a kids movie!!! What kind of values promote this movie?? It was weird and wrong from the very first minute to the last sentence! I'm scared for the world my daughter is going to live in.","13 March 2022",1,19,49
"Turning Red","Just seen the movie. I got a terrible headache. I have never seen some much rage in a kids movie. This is not a kids movie. So heavy. Just rage, rage and nothing but the rage. Not a single laugh.

I'll need few hours to calm down.

Do not watch it !!","12 March 2022",1,16,35
"Turning Red","I really wanted to love this movie. I'm so all about female-forward films. However, this sucked.

I love the puberty metaphors here, but cannot get on board with the girl exploiting herself to raise money to see a band. The whole parent/child relationship felt so contrived. The dads voice acting was terrible, and I honestly felt no sympathy toward the mother. Bad writing, bad acting, and bad story. Do better with your cultural films!","1 May 2022",4,4,6
"Turning Red","Super duper relate to where i live with (for Chinese Immigrants) in Indonesia.

This movie is really chilling, so fun, lots of comedy, and the story is solid.

The animation is SUPER GOOD like anime-manga-y(?): full of expressions.","20 March 2022",10,3,5
"Turning Red","I had less than low expectations but holy damn! 100% the worst pixar movie ever and by a country mile. I guarantee you won't be able to amke it past the 5 minute mark (Unless you have no intelligence then you'll be fine!).","12 March 2022",2,10,24
"Turning Red","No one in my family liked the this movie. Mostly they didn't like the story. Animation was great as one would expect from Pixar. But the story was not very relatable. I guess if you are a 13 year old girl you might like it.

But the film most definitely has an agenda.

Here are some unsolicited quotes from my kids

""I hope they delete the movie so I never see it movie again""
""The definition of boredom""
""The art work was amazing""","13 March 2022",2,9,19
"Turning Red","This was a wild ride of emotions, I was laughing then next thing I knew I was on the verge of tears. It was great to see a different culture represented in Pixar's magic. That boy band craze from the 90s was spot on! And I loved all the sudden jumps into anime style.","24 July 2022",8,1,2
"Turning Red","This movie is absolute trash.

It will put thoughts and actions into your daughters head that wasn't there before.

Why must we constantly force ""views"" on our children. It's disgusting.","23 March 2022",1,11,22
"Turning Red","For the first time ever watching a Pixar movie I felt like there was a clear market audience and I wasn't part of it. Everything else put out by Pixar has either been good or not so good, or Cars 2, and if there has been a target audience then I've clearly been part of that audience and never reflected over it. This time I kept thinking that this will probably speak a lot to some people, and I can see why, but I can't relate. The main point of the movie is of course the relationship between a child and a mother, but as someone who's parents were never very strict or controlling and which whom I've never had any major quarrels, I find it like standing outside and looking in through a foggy window trying to connect to that aspect of the movie. I have also never been a teenage girl or part of a loud screaming fan-base that just has to get tickets to X event, so that part also fell flat for me, and even though I was a teenager in the 2010's and my teenage years are probably closer to this movies depiction than say my parents in the 80's, the sort of language and mannerisms show in this movie was never something I or my closest friends adapted into our lives.

I still give this movie 6/10, which is not bad, because I can see that there is some appeal there is you are the right person for it. Also I applaud Pixar for going a bit further than usual with the hormonal teenager stuff. I haven't fact checked it, but I feel like this is the first time we've heard the word ""sexy"" used in a Pixar movie. Also there is talk of periods and pads and in one scene you can hear the song Bootylicious playing with audible lyrics. I though we were further off from seeing that in one of Disney/Pixars animated movies.","13 March 2022",6,2,4
"Turning Red","Absolute junk. Not a good story at all and just a bunch of nonsense. We get it kids know everything and shouldn't pay attention to their ""dumb"" parents. Disney just gets worse with every movie.","15 May 2022",1,7,15
"Turning Red","I'm glad disney pixar is made a slice of life movie with a little fantasy flavor. This movie has a good basic moral that tells us being different is fine and unique. This movie could be enjoyable for teenagers or asian teenagers since almost everything is relatable to our lifes. I can tell you're an adult or a really mature teenager if you dislike this movie, i understand, the story is kinda silly for the type of a person like you.","11 March 2022",9,13,44
"Turning Red","After reading the preview, it is really cute. What an interesting setting. There is a beast hidden in everyone's heart. You don't have to please others and be true to yourself. Finally, the little panda is really cute.","21 March 2022",10,3,6
"Turning Red","With the last film, Pixar has started to tribute to Ghibli. But this one takes to a new level. Turning Red is a very inspiring Pixar film. Not only has this has a well told coming of age story, but also puts on a lot of creativity with Mei's red transformation as it's a direction of Chinese tradition. The characters are nicely developed especially with Mei and her family. The message of growing up and try new things that makes you happy is very touching. Even as I've seen the movie, I do have traditional vacations every summer with my family. But I've started to use my work savings for new places to go. That's what makes me think it can make my life enjoyable. And Pixar continues to have incredible animation that tributes to anime. That and especially when it comes to the animation of Mei's transformation. Not as a masterpiece as other Pixar films like the Toy Story films, Monsters Inc, Wall-E, Soul and many more with a few cliched elements, but this has given Domee Shi a great start for filmmaking. We are getting a lot of anticipated movies this year, and this is one of them I recommend to watch especially for those that grew up in the early 2000s. Because I can already feel this brings the peoples' memories of the early music and how it was at the time. We still have Lightyear coming up but even that may probably be better than this one, it is still a great example of how Pixar can make coming-of-age into a worthy film.","16 March 2022",9,5,22
"Turning Red","Big swing and a miss. Absolutely disgusting parenting and exhausting to watch. If you parent like this... you need to go to therapy.

A showcase of toxic parenting, and a complete lack of accountability. Break the cycle people... just because it happened to you when you were a kid DOES NOT give you the right to treat your kids the same way.

All around gross to watch, but glad I did with my kid so I could explain to her how awful this type of behavior is and that she should always stand up for herself.

AIRBALL PIXAR.","14 March 2022",1,14,33
"Turning Red","This film just teaches kids how you should disrespect and disobey your family over friends and how to be a stubborn against your family. That's all nothing more to say. I am very disappointed on pixar animated studio. Disney just ruined them.","11 June 2022",1,4,9
"Turning Red","This film was more a comedy, than one of Disney's famed moral of the story type films. Yes, it was the underlying concept, but it simply was not strong enough. If not for the commentary at the end, I would have no clue what the moral of the story was. And I have to give a nod for Hollywood FINALLY using actors(well voice actors) playing people of their races. Even so, it was in all, more a lighthearted comedy (the kind of humour that its so bad you laugh) than anywhere close to a monumental film.","23 April 2022",6,1,2
"Turning Red","It's like it's not even a Pixar film. It's like you're watching some modern day show on Cartoon Network, possibly even adult swim.

You can tell it was directed by a woman because of how open they talk about periods. Look, I'm a woman, so I understand first-hand periods, but isn't this supposed to be a family film? Regardless of how understanding a boy or man is, they're not going to be entertained by statements such as, ""You have to protect your petals and wash them frequently"".

It's a very cringe-inducing movie with absolutely no creative aspect.","14 March 2022",1,13,28
"Turning Red","Not going to waste my fingertips too much on this trash. So many great lessons for our children here:

Lying to parents
Lying to friends
Judging other kids without knowing them
Rebelling against parents
Lashing out in anger
Hiding things from parents
The list goes on.

Disney approaches similar themes in other movies with such charm and nuance. This movie is just plain crass. Vile garbage.","12 March 2022",1,17,38
"Turning Red","Pixar managed to transform something pretty typical (Teen Wolf, anyone?) into something *slightly* deeper...about womanhood and family and independence. The whole thing was genuinely entertaining and also a reminder that fresh perspectives can take familiar stories to another level. It is possible people over-hyped this one - since I thought both Coco and Soul reached higher heights - but it was still better than 90% of the animated films that come out every year. Plus, as a parent of a 12 year old daughter/panda, I could relate.","21 March 2022",7,4,18
"Turning Red","The movie is terrible in almost every way,
doesn't really relate to any audiences, including young girls.

The movie tries to make a statement but falls short.","22 March 2022",2,5,13
"Turning Red","I absolutely loved Disney and Pixar's turning red. The movie was very satisfying to watch. The animation was unique and different from past Disney Pixar films. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a family film.","12 March 2022",10,7,21
"Turning Red","My 6 friends and I loved this film so much we watched it twice in a row. So relatable, very emotional. This is a film for everyone, it has so many layers to it.","10 April 2022",10,2,3
"Turning Red","Despite the controversial headlines and reviews, I still decided to give this movie a fair shake and watch it through with an open mind. While the film was visually beautiful, my experience left me feeling like a creepy third party eavesdropping on teenagers in the mall. The only thing I felt throughout were some secondhand cringe moments. Notably absent here was the lighthearted humor prevalent in other Pixar films.

The problem is not just that this movie was made for a certain demographic, it is that this movie did not even try to appeal to a wider audience (despite being set in 2002 and pre-dating smart phones). Even Pixar's princess film Brave targeted wide audiences. Surely Disney knew this was an issue and it is why this movie never had a theatrical run of any kind.

To sum it up, this is the first Pixar film not made for a wide audience. And that is deeply troubling.","3 April 2022",4,3,9
"Turning Red","I think I liked it more than I thought I would. It's obviously allegorical and heavy handed but I still think it's fun to watch. The characters are fine...I didn't really love any of them because they were all one note. ""I shout"" ""I am moody"" ""Im cheesy"" like it was just one word to describe everyone. I guess the mum is the most complex character and I do think that Sandra Oh does a good job.

I don't know why I have such an issue with recent Pixar animation style. It looks awful to me. Like a bad cartoon. Everyone looks like they are made from plastic. They are like Playmobile toys. It just looks bad to me. Like the animation is clean and like polished af but the style just isn't for me.","8 December 2022",6,1,2
"Turning Red","Lovely movie about what it is like to grow up as kids in the 21st century. Life is confusing when you're a 13 year old girl and the movie captured this in a great way. From getting your first crush to your parents embarrassing you in public. They portrayed how important friendship is. I loved that the girls in their friendgroup all had different personalities that didn't always allign, but they accepted each other and love one another unconditionaly. I also liked that they included getting your first period and for boys to like the same things as girls (i.e. Listening to boyband).

The movie also portrayed (healing) generational trauma/pain in a great way. We see Meilin breaking away from that cycle by accepting who she is and embracing it, and by showing her mom and family members that they're good the way they are and don't have to be perfect.

The movie was very enjoyable and I definitely recommend watching it.","17 March 2022",8,3,10
"Turning Red","Mei Mei's mother's character was completely awful. It spoiled this movie for me. She was overly protective, intrusive and overbearing. If my daughter got the kind of grades Mei Mei got and helped around the house I would certainly let her go to a concert. I didn't think it was funny at all that she embarrassed her in front of her whole class by bringing her period pads. I know it's a cartoon, but the mother character ruined the movie.","12 March 2022",5,4,8
"Turning Red","Pixar has sold out to the trendy expectations of culture and gender inclusion. And they got it wrong. Missed gender empowerment by making boys villains, men heroes and women villains and girls victims of their mothers. Missed the cultural inclusion by portraying cultures within their expected stereotypes and completely missing the richness that culture has to offer. Created a Chinese legend of the ""Red Panda"" that has zero legend in actual Chinese storytelling. Completely made up and smashed into a oriental setting. Very artificial.

The storyline, interestingly, follows the Taiwanese soap opera drama blueprint. Boy meets girl, girl hates boy, then girl falls for boy, but mother tries to ruin the relationship and a battle ensues. The irony is that the predictable story that follows the Taiwan drama blueprint is the only culturally accurate element of the movie! Funny.

I wanted to like this movie, but, sitting with my Chinese wife and stepson, I was cringing in embarrassment. Like taking her to dinner at Panda Express and patting myself on the back for being culturally educated. What is sweet n sour? What is red panda? That doesn't even look like a panda!","15 March 2022",5,5,13
"Turning Red","Once again another theme of a dysfunctional family, but it's not a bad thing. I feel like a lot of people can relate to the characters in this one, and their journey to self acceptance. I felt like it was paced pretty well, has both funny and serious moments, and overall has a lot of charm. I do wish it was a bit longer though, seemed pretty short. I would have loved to learn more about their family and ancestors, why some red panda transformations are bigger than others, why a red panda in the first place, etc. Overall a great movie for families and has a great message.","12 March 2022",8,5,14
"Turning Red","Pretty sure I saw this movie 35 years ago. Was it called TEEN WOLF or something? Just missing the truck surfing scene and the bit where she bites a beer with her canines.","26 March 2022",4,4,6
"Turning Red","It's not perfect, but it really works.

The plot was fun, the characters were adorable and relatable to those who grew up in the early 2000s and actually look their age, and it really hit the humour and emotional moments on the mark.

The animation style was cute and you can really tell what the story creator was trying to say with this film.

Individuality is really important, especially when you're just a child.

I'm also really glad it make an effort to talk about puberty. Not a lot of kid's movies will make even a reference to it -- especially in young girls. I'm really happy this one did, though. It's important to life and needs to be normalised.

Props to Domee Shi for actually connecting with the experiences of young audiences. Especially those who grew up around the time the film is set.","12 March 2022",7,7,32
"Turning Red","I had a pretty unique experience with the movie. I thought the first third of the film had a not-so-subtle message. Don't get me wrong, I love Pixar movies mostly cause they manage to be a fun, and joyful experience for kids, but also a thoughtful and emotional metaphoric driven experience to adults. And at the end of the day, I love all the subjects, like anxiety, anger, jealously and all the other emotions a teenager starts to be wrap into after a certain age. Still, I thought they didn't do a great job of having a more subtle message, instead of ""yeah, she's a big red monster now... and her mother brought her a pad"".

However, as the story kept going, I was more and more involved into it, and at the end, the gut punch, in what already is one of my favorite lines ever in a movie ""And yeah... sometimes I miss how things were, but nothing stays the same forever"". I mean, c'mon!!! This got me good, real good. And I feel most people 20y+ will probably feel the same.

Anyways, I thing the movie is pretty good, as always Pixar manages to tell a story that will entertain most kids, and basically leave all adults watering at the end. And I will never get tire of this formula. Keep it up.","15 March 2022",8,4,17
"Turning Red","I don't understand the low ratings from some of the other commenters. This is a first-rate movie. It's light-hearted, but it also has something deep to say about girls' struggles to grow up and establish their own identities. The visuals are both gorgeous and funny (especially if you're from Toronto). Not to be missed!","27 June 2022",10,3,7
"Turning Red","This movie wasnt the best movie I've watched this year but it definitly wasnt the worst either.

I loved the main characters friend group, and I loved her aunts and dad. The actual main character was a little annoying and dumb but i could tolarate her. The plot was a little irrelevant and maybe not a good plot for a movie, but they played it out pretty nice.","17 April 2022",6,1,1
"Turning Red","What you want of animation? This animation is great as learnging lesson life to childs even parrents
It's great and so different at story
Great at music, quality and everything.","13 March 2022",10,5,13
"Turning Red","This movie was complete garbage its cringy its embarrasing for me to say that i watched this movie the creators of this movie surely had no idea what they were doing its annoying that the characters were childish and cringy the main character was the most annoying part of the movie and in the end in the consert it was AWFUL seeing their stupid animated faces DO NOT watch this movie i repeat DO NOT.","19 March 2022",1,9,19
"Turning Red","This is a straight to DVD quality film front to back. The morals are ok but the animation and annoyingly shrill character voices at times are tough to endure. A little left leaning and overly woke for me.","12 March 2022",3,11,26
"Turning Red","We have seen all these stereotypes in films, in TV shows way too often and it's really really getting old, then with women's M cycle thrown in as educational (?) materials, I can imagine the male audience squirming in their seats, it's really a overall bad movie experience.","10 May 2022",2,4,11
"Turning Red","I didn't have high hopes for this movie, so I'm not surprised that it wasn't very good. Glad I waited to rent it on video.

Seems like lately the Disney children's animation is actually made for childrenless Disney Adult Fans and not actually for children. Mei is a teen who is rebellious, but unrelatable. There is nothing controversial, but it is supposed to be aimed at adults and older kids, not toddler or younger aged children. But the cute panda makes it seem for toddlers and no teen would actually watch this.

Mei's mother wants to protect her, teen sneaks out, basically can't stand her mom, yet her mom is not the typical Disney villian so the story is lacking substance. Although some parts were funny and the panda is cute we felt as though we wasted our time watching this movie. This wasn't a Disney classic, just another Disney movie.","19 September 2022",4,2,3
"Turning Red","Overall, it's a typical kid funny movie from Disney. Lots of fun moments. I think children will like it very much. I gave it 10 stars for comedy. It's got family moments, friend moments, love moments, dance moments, and also make you think moments.","11 April 2022",10,1,1
"Turning Red","You know when I first heard about the ""controversy"" and the outrage culture over this film, it caught my attention. People where claiming this ""was the end of Pixar and Disney itself"" with other claims such as ""it's the end of western civilization's culture itself"", I grew curious and decided to watch this film to see the ""atrocity"" the film was going to ""show"" only to be surprised with a pretty average film that explores a second generation teenage girl experiencing the world with her friends, with a magical twist.

Adults that watch this film seem to misinterpret the actions of Mei and think it's ""encouraging the youth to disrespect your parents"" clearly ignoring the fact is... Mei is a teenager, it's normal for teens to disobey and make mistakes wither you like it or not, you can say that it's wrong but this film isn't glorifying it, she gets grounded in the film for doing that. This film was so over hated that all the parts that where criticized such as the ""dreaded"" talks about period pads or puberty was so inoffensive and glossed over the film, I'm shocked by all the outrage this film created. What are you guys, 10 years old? Freaking out over a movie that has a young teen girl in a movie that talks about puberty for like 10 minutes tops and becomes another ""growing up"" type of film? Are you kidding me!?

Other than that, while the film art style is a bit unique in it's own way, the lighting of the film is beautiful, the color theory in the film is very good, it's like looking at a Jolly Rancher in a way, the music while it's not my type of music I usually hear, is pretty catchy and mixed traditional Chinese instrumentals with modern western instruments. I like the character design is actually pretty cool, I like how diverse how the females are drawn, they feel like real people. If this rating system allowed half star ratings, this would be a 7.5/10 stars.","4 April 2022",7,2,4
"Turning Red","Which teenager does not have the fear of disappointing their parents and try to juggle between the who they are and who their parents want them to be. Throw in the twister of a mystical red panda and you have got yourself a good story to narrate to which every teenager to young adult and some mature adults can connect to.

But the story is not enough when you make a movie and that is where it went wrong. The teams involved would have worked hard to create the content but it felt like the impact of the movie fell flat. When watching, I felt like the movie kept jumping from one topic to another and somehow connected them together to form a story. There were many aspects that were introduced but never used to their potential.

The movie had the idea to capture the interest of the audience but couldn't maintain it till the end.","20 August 2022",6,1,1
"Turning Red","This movie doesn't make any kind of sense...
I get they wanted to make a movie to ""normalise"" the red days, but this was just an awful way to present it...

The idea in itself is nice, even maybe original, but the way it's been executed shows poor form and says many bad things about the Director...

I am really happy that I didn't go to the cinema to see it. It was a complete waste of time.","13 April 2022",1,5,10
"Turning Red","Ok movie. You won't miss anything if you skip it, but it is acceptable if you are locked at home without a better plan.

It has some good moments. The references to the teens of the 2000s are quite fun.

However, it is far from the great Pixar movies that we were used to. Sad, but it is already quite clear that the golden age of Pixar is over.","9 July 2022",5,3,6
"Turning Red","I didn't expect to enjoy this as much as I did. The messages the film is trying to convey are presented in a manner that's not as ""in your face"" as other films in this genre. The characters are likable and relatable and it's very nostalgic for us nineties and early 2000s kids.","13 March 2022",8,5,12
"Turning Red","Conventional but funny positive coming-of-age diverse animated comedy about an explosive Chinese-Canadian teenager (I was feeling some interest for the boys band's songs before realising there was some Eilish in there...)","21 March 2022",7,3,13
"Turning Red","Not amongst Pixar's best in terms of the character design, plot and animation, however Turning Red is entertaining and funny for the most part.

I don't think I've ever seen an underdeveloped character in animation as Mei's dad. He felt like an after thought. Everything about him from the voice acting to the character design is mediocre.

Something felt disconcerting about Mei's age, I think this plot would've best suited a 15+ year old character.","12 March 2022",7,5,21
"Turning Red","The movie was like a breath of fresh air - anime elements, over-the-top content, cool band and cool expressions; sometimes is good to decide Yourself and not let the deciding to Your parents.

The age of main character is 13 so pre-school kids understand the movie better if they grow a bit older.","27 March 2022",8,2,6
"Turning Red","I had a fun time with this movie, especially the editing, animation and visual style was a treat. The pastel colored city was pure eye candy. The movie in general feels less like a Pixar movie than I am used to. Most of the time Pixar movies have something for each age group. But Turning Red really feels like it was meant for kids and not much else. Which means harder scenes to sit through and you might consider cringe. I guess that's okay, but it makes this movie a lesser family film than previous works from Pixar. Music is great, catchy songs as well.

The movie only starts to get a little heart towards the end, mostly to do with harsh parental expectations brought down by the older generation. Though it doesn't go further than that. I hoped for a bit more exploration there and emotional moments.

Overall it was fun, but probably the least memorable Pixar movie I have seen. It's still a good movie, technically everything works, the story just lacks the subtle adult humor and nods that we come to expect from Pixar.","25 March 2022",7,2,7
"Turning Red","Not as good as the other 2 most recent pixar films (Soul and Luca) but still a lot better than most of their 2010s stuff. I the movie was funnier in the 2nd half since it was so funny in the first, and I wish some scenes were different (the cringe at the mart near the start wasn't to my heart), but it's a good time.","12 March 2022",7,4,13
"Turning Red","Just what I expected from the woke Disney writers of late. Anti-Christian, Pro-China, boys are bad, disobeying your parents is good, they only missed checking a few boxes, although we gave up watching after 15 minutes or so. Weak, even for Disney.","26 March 2022",1,12,26
"Turning Red","It's a story we've seen a thousand times about a girl growing up and getting rebellious when she was oh so perfect while having an over-protective mom who just seems to enjoy humiliating her... Anger and frustration seems to be the main theme of the movie since it happens so many times.

The story is not told very well because it includes so many cliché with boys band and whatnot.

Despite a trailer which made the movie look fun, it really lacks of originality.

Disney/Pixar have always been good at conveying messages through their movies. Turning Red on the other hand is getting lost in them... Is it about anger? Self control? Being yourself? Growing up? Being rebellious? Expressing your emotions? Family? Friends? Or maybe it is about moms being over-protective? About period? The movie just keeps contradicting itself in it's messages.

Story wise, this is a mess !

The art style is really ugly and lacks the cuteness and many colors we usually see in those movies.

The only cute thing in the movie is the red panda Mei Meil turns into when she is not losing it.

It doesn't seem like a lot of work has been put into this movie (most likely because it came out on Disney+ instead of movie theatres). It's a quick cash-in to attract people to their streaming service.

The music isn't good or memorable either it's some low quality chinese traditional music remake along with some annoying boys band music.

Want to see a good movie? Watch Encanto instead !

Also, I don't think that putting period on the table (and insisting so much on it in the begining) was a good idea for a children movie.

I really hope disney/pixar is going to try harder in the future because this trend of low quality movies is starting to be a disaster. You can definitely feel how money hungry Disney became as of late, spending millions on marketing campaign for these kind of movies which will make people purchase their Disney+ subscriptions. They really should be spending more on creating good movies rather than marketing campaigns.","18 March 2022",1,7,14
"Turning Red","Great animation but not a movie to watch with kids. Bizarre story and terrible message passed to children. It contains all the woke stuff pushed to society these days.","27 March 2022",3,5,15
"Turning Red","As a 36 year old white man. I'm probably not the target audience for this.

However.

It's incredible. Loved it.

Fantastic coming of age film.

"Turning Red","Poor subject content for children . What made anyone think that parents would be happy with having to explain subject matter to their children when they were expecting an entertaining g visit to the cinema I have no idea?","12 March 2022",1,11,23
"Turning Red","Some people say that Turning red is an animated disaster, some other say it's pretty good, so it's divisive. I belong to the second category. When I first watched it in cinema I liked it but when I watched it for the second time on Disney plus I liked it even more.","12 July 2022",8,1,2
"Turning Red","A creative Pixar film that tackles the onset of puberty and teen angst. I did like how Chinese heritage was incorporated into the main character's cultural background and conflict with the red panda. Not the most memorable film in Pixar's film collection, but it's worth a one-time viewing.","22 March 2022",5,2,6
"Turning Red","This film is wonderful, fun and energetic Disney Pixar content! I loved how unique and unusual the topics of the film were. The movie definitely stands out as one of the better Pixar films yet to be released! Highly recommend it.","12 March 2022",10,5,10
"Turning Red","This film was definitely a very touching and unique family animated movie. The whole concept of this film was regarding sensitive themes and topics. My family and I really enjoyed this films culture, ideas and more ! Highly recommend watching !","12 March 2022",10,5,10
"Turning Red","Well i just only watch near to half of the film and I didn't like it and this movie is bot able to be compared with the other animation of Disney So i think that the other animation and live actions from Disney are so much more beautiful than this movie.","22 March 2022",3,5,11
"Turning Red","Just......no. I guess not for me. Love so many Pixar films and have seen almost every animated movie ever made (including many other great companies of course). Maybe 13 year old girls will like it? I guess I'm just really glad I wasn't a controlling mother.","14 March 2022",1,12,29
"Turning Red","I thought of watching the movie just because IGN gave it 9 and said it's funny movie but it's clearly not a little funny
Just a teenager being fangirl and pervert over some band boys
It was awful movie didn't expect anything like this from Pixar.","23 April 2022",1,5,14
"Turning Red","The movie started out interesting but after 10 minutes you get lost completely . There happens so much but it makes no sence at all. The characters are all super annoying and there is no character development in the whole story, towards the end of the movie the story just got ridiculous very ridculous, and the choice of the main character is very predictable and stupid ""to keep her panda"". Whoever wrote this should be fired!","2 July 2022",1,5,13
"Turning Red","This movie is definitely very cute and clever with lots of great references, themes and messages that are difficult to discuss in a mainstream way. It is definitely in my top list of Pixar films. I enjoyed the film and think it should be well received with most audiences!","12 March 2022",10,7,27
"Turning Red","It's great to see pixar swing back after a dry period.

Turning red is a great and fun movie that knows what it wants to be. It is a story about growing up, becoming youself and see your ansestary in the eyes.

We follow Mei Lee who is under a family curse that turns her into a red panda when she gets emotional. She now has to juggle getting rid of the curse and having fun with her friends. Her family duty vs. Her own identity.

The movies symbolism is easy to translate and kids will defenetly recognise some of the things happening to Mei Lee. All the emotions in the teenage years and realising your not your parents is tough and defenetly something everyone has to go through.

The humor can be amazing here but also a bit too ""trying"". Some of the humor feels like low tear ""loud is funny""-kind of humor whitch doesn't land with me. But you still feel like that's just how Mei Lee and her friends communicate. There friendship seems really well made and is a treat to watch.

Mei Lee's mom is the obstacle in this movie, the one that wants Mei Lee to stay as she is and follow her path. You still understand where she comes from though and she is a well written obstacle charecter that creates a very emotional climax to this movie.

Overall Pixar is back and this movie is entertaining and heartwarming. While the movie doesn't always land all it's jokes for me, it's still an emensly enjoyable watch.","3 October 2022",7,1,2
"Turning Red","I've always loved Pixar movies, but this is by far their worst movie. I couldn't even finish it. It was so manic, annoying and lacked any of the beauty and subtlety of previous Pixar films.","8 April 2022",2,5,9
"Turning Red","Turning Red is warm, funny, lighthearted.

Still I have a question: what's the difference between this and Pete's Inside Out? Or Coco? Or Luca? Or any of those middling films they've put out in the last 5 years?

Disney/Pixar's going over the same thing for way too long. Now while I thoroughly enjoyed Turning Red, I actually expected more of Pixar. I mean they're not Disney Animation Studio, they're not Dreamworks, and they're most definitely not Illumination! Pixar used to be better than this, matter of fact, the best! They took pride in their innovations. But recently I'm afraid that the magic of Pixar is gone.

Damn, I really miss Pixar in the 2000's.

By the way, ENCANTO REALLY SUCKS.","15 March 2022",7,4,10
"Turning Red","As someone who grew up with an overbearing mother, this animation was very triggering to watch. But I liked the story and the premise. The ending was a little bit too rushed and I didn't relate to the gushing over boy bands part, but like all Pixar movies, the message was great!","11 March 2022",7,6,24
"Turning Red","I'm giving this a 3 because there are a handful of really fun moments, and the red pandas are adorable.

I feel terrible that I watched this with my kids. And I somewhat regret not turning it off . But I worried that would draw MORE attention to the already attention grabby moments.

And for the record, I did not mind they talked about periods. It wasnt crass, it was just kind of silly. However, the semi sexual teenage girl behavior was uncalled for and I guess I have to screen Pixar movies along with everything else.

And honestly it was just not a great story. Dissapointing all around.","12 March 2022",3,4,11
"Turning Red","The characters are dull, uncharismatic, unimpressive, boring and have no depth. The story is lame in general. The sound almost not recognized and gives you 0 imersive feeling to the scenes. The settings of the scenes are just to forget instantly.

You really dont get any connection to this movie. Beside the typical ""new-age"" nonsense about inclusion, some feminism, SJW nonsense and pseudo getting into adulthood, you would not know it was from pixar if there was no logo in the beginning.

That it has a avg rating of 7+ shows how people have tuned into liking mediocre boring stuff. Its a shame.","20 March 2022",4,3,6
"Turning Red","As someone who lives in an Asian country, I can say this was very relatable for me. I think most of us have been through these kind of things during our teenage years. Wish I could watch Turning Red when I was 13.","17 March 2022",10,5,14
"Turning Red","Why was this film not released in cinemas. It is the best Disney animation since Tangled. Just great characters & animation, filled with fun dialogue which deserves the big screen. This film is so good, even the boy band '4 Town', deserve their own movie.

8/10.","15 March 2022",9,4,19
"Turning Red","I watched this film accidentally. My 2 year old son saw a picture of it on Disney + and thought it was a fox. He likes foxes so we ended up watching the film. We both loved it. He was transfixed by the animation. For me I love the quirkiness of it and found it refreshing that there were so many main female characters. It was nostalgic too, as the friendship group reminded me a lot of my friendship group when I was at school and I've never seen those kind of teen girls portrayed in film before.

My only criticism is that the portrayal of overly strict parental figures is becoming a bit of a cliche with Disney films lately (Brave, Encanto, Coco etc..
and now Seeing Red). It might be interesting if they portrayed it the other way round as in some overly laid back parents who learn the value of providing more boundaries and discipline.","3 July 2022",9,2,4
"Turning Red","Pixar's latest offering, Turning Red was recently pushed to a direct OTT release on Disney+. Directed by Domee Shi (a story artist with Pixar) in her directorial debut, Turning Red is another attempt by Disney to showcase diverse cultural groups in their movies.

Set in 2002, Turning Red is the story of Meilin, a 13-year-old Chinese Canadian girl, who lives with her family in Toronto. After an embarassing incident, Meilin transforms into a red panda; a transformation that happens when she is in a state of high emotion.

Turning Red is yet another Disney/Pixar film that encourages/inspires it's viewers to embrace their quirkiness, to take time to discover yourself and so on. This has essentially been the core lesson of most Pixar films but the difference is in the way they present these stories. The entire red panda transformation works well as an analogy of the emotional changes that teenagers tackle while growing up. Domee Shi & co-writer JULIA CHO have done an incredible job at tackling a tried and tested formula with their own unique style of humor, adopting some anime style animation & Shi's own experiences in Toronto.

Turning Red is proof that Pixar still has an unlimited supply of stories to tell set in different cultural settings and I can't wait to see what they come up with next (after Lightyear, which is another derivative work).

Turning Red features the voices of Rosalie Chiang, Sandra Oh, AVA MORSE, Maitreyi Ramakrishnan, Orion Lee, Jordan Fisher among others.","16 March 2022",8,3,13
"Turning Red","I don't want to give spoilers but there's a part towards the end that's rather stupid. It doesn't ruin the movie but the ending conflict could've been better. Still I'm glad I watched it. Turning Red is a good, nostalgic movie.

I didn't realize this movie took place in 2002 until the end. I'm not surprised though, this felt exactly like my junior high. (Except, I don't know a teenager who wouldn't be dying of embarrassment wearing that panda costume at the Temple.)

She should've been a year or two younger though. She's a bit immature for thirteen. By eighth grade no one wore Tamagotchis and boy bands were no longer cool. But for 11 or even 12, she'd be spot on.

The characters were the best part, particularly Mei and her mom. I liked how her friends were there for her. (Not a spoiler, in the trailer.)

Another review mentioned sensitive topics. When Mei changes for the first time her mom thinks she's started her period. Nothing is really directly stated though, just hinted at, so I don't think it's inappropriate for children but you should know that periods and pads are mentioned.

Turning Red is a light, feel good movie with good characters and I definitely plan to buy it.","11 March 2022",7,8,31
"Turning Red","Easily the worst Pixar movie I've ever seen. This movie could have worked forty years ago but yikes, by modern standards this film is so painful ..........................","13 March 2022",1,12,30
"Turning Red","This movie is an really good step in the right direction for pixar, its one of the first feature length movies directed by a woman from the company, which is great but it has taken to long

I love how it covers a taboo and topics that are often shyed away from especially in kids movie, like periods and female puberty in general

I hear people calling it cringe and it's giving them ""second hand embarrassment"" THATS LITERALLY THE PREMISE OF THE MOVIE

I love that it's based around the life of a young Asian girl it's always lovely to see diversity especially in kids movies

The plot felt a bit predictable at times but it's made up for by the incredible animation and the music

Ik some are calling it ""less relatable"" than other pixar movies because its from the perspective of a preteen girl, when this is the same company thats made films about talking cars and bugs so I find that a bit confusing

But overall a good movie but you may have to explain what a period is to your kids afterwards 😅","13 March 2022",8,3,5
"Turning Red","This vapid, insignificant ware of time and money is a clear rip off of Teen Wolf.

The art is terrible, the plot is nonexistent, the characters seem as if they've been mass produced through an assembly line.

Just because the people who wasted their time making this movie doesn't mean you have to waste your time watching it.","14 March 2022",,5,11
"Turning Red","Pixar's latest work Turning Red is a remarkable new take on what the studio is normally used to when having their films as realistic as possible to the real world both visually and figuratively. However, Oscar-winning director Domee Shi assembled this world by focusing on a more cartoonish side, yet still retaining realism aesthetically from an adolescent girl's perspective.

Enter 13-year-old Meilin Lee (voiced by newcomer Rosalie Chiang). A spunky and outgoing Chinese-Canadian girl who lives in Toronto at her family shrine with loving parents, likable best friends, and of course her love for boy band 4-Town. But during one night, she has a nightmare that magically transforms her into a giant red panda the next morning. With this new form, it's a whirlwind of tackling her own emotions that are at odds between her mother (voiced by Sandra Oh) and her best friends.

From my understanding, this movie sees Mei's transformation as a metaphor for puberty. While the conflicting notion between mother and daughter is similar to Brave, this is explored in the modern times that also makes light in the bodily changes a young teenage girl goes through. Though Mei's mom tries to find what's best for her daughter, it often leads to embarrassing confrontations and misunderstandings. I've heard from some viewers that criticized over this not being appropriate in a kids film, but I'm impressed the studio handled this topical thing delicately and respectfully. Like they used such words with subtlety, yet implied by the actions.

While the filmmakers cited Miyazaki's My Neighbor Totoro as the inspiration in creating the red panda design, I also see the humor of shape-shifting to and back at will being reminiscent to the comedic nature of Ranma 1/2, which also featured a type of panda. Not to mention some gestures and visuals reminiscent of Sailor Moon as Shi cited that series as her personal favorite growing up. Given everything on balancing her personal life and family life, Mei finds her own morals with these new changes. Overall, with the stereotypes in Asian families clearly visible near-throughout (which I find normal), all of that is put aside with the concept of not knowing how to grow up to your parent's standards.

Moral: There's no rulebook on it, it's how you handle it head-on with all the rights and wrongs you've known in life.","18 March 2022",8,3,13
"Turning Red","The anime tears - unrealistic cartoon elements does not fit the appeal of a disney pixar movie. It seemed corny. I get they are chinese but this isn't a Dragon Ball Z cartoon.

I'm 28, every Disney Pixar Movie is enjoyable for adults and kids - I guess this is a kids movie, but this is truly a ""kid's movie"".

I get it disney movies have the same formula but people love them. Tangled, Finding Nemo, Coco, Soul, Ratatouille, Toy Story, Monsters Inc, Frozen, Moana, they make you feel and have a climactic ending. This movie tried but it was lacking. And is in a whole different class.

Definitely glad it didn't end up in theatres.

Will be listening to ""We don't talk about Bruno"" for a while longer.

Side notes: 2 ritual circles in the last 2 years in disney movies.(Soul) I can enjoy the movie but the intentional subliminals for wiccans is overdone.","13 March 2022",1,11,27
"Turning Red","We literally could not watch it. Not sensitive to young boys in the least bit. I thought this would be a coming to age with subtle notes, but it was obvious. Very disappointed.","12 March 2022",1,18,44
"Turning Red","I miss the Pixar that made Walle, Bugs Life and Toy Story.

Those days they were funny and thought provoking. I mean who didn't cry during Up?

Now what do we get? A cute looking red panda will only get you so far.","21 March 2022",3,5,11
"Turning Red","I'm generally a huge fan of Disney movies, but this has to be the worst Disney movie ever created. It is boring, the characters are racist and sexist, and I kept checking how much time was left because it felt so tedious to endure.","12 March 2022",1,7,14
"Turning Red","Mehh more turning bad. The characters are way over the top and unlikeable(especially the main character she is often very rude). That with a strange story makes this movie just bad definitlely for Pixar! Every company has its good and bad movies, this one is very bad. I hope this doesn't happen too often, because that comes at the expense of the quality of Pixar.","9 June 2022",1,4,10
"Turning Red","7 out of 10 is very generous. I don't know why this even came out no wonder they didn't even want this in the theater at all. I bet no one would pay to watch.","11 March 2022",1,17,48
"Turning Red","Out of all of the Pixar movies that deal with the topic of self acceptance this one is in last place. So many stereotypes about Chinese immigrants living in a westernized society. It was hard to get through. I have no desire to ever watch it again.","14 March 2022",1,11,27
"Turning Red","Compared to other Pixar films this one is just okay. The message is fine, but it isn't as new and revolutionary as some people are hyping. It is funny at times, but just kind of funny. In my opinion the music and boy band stuff is a little obnoxious, but I was never into that. I can get where some people may like it, but this movie in my opinion has as many moments where I thought it was meh as it did moments that were good. Not for everyone.","20 July 2022",5,2,3
"Turning Red","Turning Red is a poignant, heartfelt coming of age film from a studio that hadn't really tackled this subject matter before. The animation is as vibrant as ever and the voice cast does a tremendous job. The boy band stuff was pretty on point to be honest and the cultural aspects where refreshing to see. It doesn't quite pack the emotional wallop that a lot of Pixar classics do, but it still manages to deliver a terrific story.

Yes, there are some cringey moments, but honestly that's the most accurate depiction of adolescence there is. Even if this film isn't targeted squarely at you, anyone can still find plenty to enjoy. You don't have to be an adolescent girl to appreciate the universal struggle of family and growing up while you don't understand what's happening to your body. It's honestly about time young girls got a film like this to look to.","27 November 2022",8,1,3
"Turning Red","I didn't like this movie at all, it's not funny at all, I didn't laugh even once. Another thing, I don't consider myself to be a feminist or a sexist, but it seems to me that this movie is only for girls.","20 July 2022",1,2,9
"Turning Red","Such an inclusive, intelligent and well executed movie.

I promise you any negative reviews come from angry white people who only want their cultures represented,
anyone else with a couple brain cells can see that this beautiful film is a must see.","2 July 2022",10,2,7
"Turning Red","This movie wasn't awful by any means, animation was fine, good at times. Plot was predictable, of course. Their were some very funny slapstick moments. Where it really missed the mark was some of the jokes were way too crude/suggestive for kids under 10, but not sophisticated enough for adults or even older teenagers. Seems like it would be fine for a child from 12-15 y/o but after that it's still to childish for older teens. Didn't really have a moral message underlying it either, just more dumb modern be yourself/do what you wanna do type stuff and that was its biggest failure.","14 May 2022",6,2,4
"Turning Red","This was a fun movie to watch but it didn't reinvent anything. My question was the plot. Was this supposed to be about a woman having her first period? All the hints were there but I may have missed it. It was cool that it took place in 2002. Interesting year to pick.","15 March 2022",7,3,17
"Turning Red","This movie was so good! Worth the watch! Don't trust the haters on their words, this movie was really good, funny, & cute! Loved every single part of it!","13 March 2022",10,5,10
"Turning Red","Definitely don't let the kids see this. In one scene, the 13 year old girl draws inappropriate pictures of herself and a 17 year old boy. Her and her mother talk about her ""delicate flower"". It's mostly children under 7 that will watch this, and I find it inappropriate. In the movie, disobeying parents is glorified in order to be one's ""true self"". To all the mamas with kids out there, don't show this one to the kiddos.","14 March 2022",1,12,31
"Turning Red","As a first generation immigration who is born and raised in china and now lives in Canada, I want to say that this movie shows the same family culture my family carries,honor yr parents for example. Sometimes we value our family more than ourselves. I also have a tiger mom and she has a high expectation on me. Watching this movie gives me a feeling of going back to home again. Great thanks to Disney!","20 March 2022",9,5,9
"Turning Red","Just wasn't good. Poor plot. I didn't like the way the kids talk to the parents. Thought it was a bad example. I thought the character development was lacking and just the overall movie wasn't good.","16 June 2022",1,6,12
"Turning Red","A truly imaginative coming of age story. Complete with a band of best friends, an overbearing mother, and an exploration of culture and what it means to be part of a family. All those 1 star reviews are from a xenophobic point of view. If you can't handle characters from all backgrounds (including the charming security guard with a turban) then maybe you should go live in a glass box of your own making.","11 March 2022",7,5,13

"Turning Red","People complaining that inclusivity and puberty should be taught in school and not at the cinema; surely it can be taught anywhere and surely every child should know about it, not just teenage girls.

How much nicer would it be if everyone could just relax and enjoy a film with a nice message instead of attacking peoples political persuasions- it's not always about that but people who have their backs up already assume it is.","11 March 2022",8,2,3
"Turning Red","A fresh movie from Pixar animation and i like it. With the chinnese praying culture, it makes different from the others. It's cute, funny, and not boring at all for me. It delivered message about how the relationship between mother with the daughter and all the families.","26 March 2022",9,2,7
"Turning Red","74/100
It only took 25 films from the Pixar family for only ONE of them to be directed entirely by a woman. Surprisingly, that's not the only first that Turning Red has to offer.

For instance, this is the first time that a Pixar film has an Asian lead, it's one of the few films from the studio to pass the bechdel test and, probably most notable to all, it's the first time that the tone of a Pixar movie feels heterogeneous, separate from the others.

It hasn't been until very recently that Pixar's movie allegories feel truly explicit in their subtlety. First Soul, then Luca and now, Turning Red, who isn't afraid to tackle issues never seen before in a children's film, with menstruation, puberty and even sexuality being the most recurrent. Even when it wasn't nearly as inventive in trying to preserve a balance between the ""Pixar"" look and a Pixar rationale - which, really, it didn't need. In my opinion, this movie could treat the giant red panda without much justification and I would have bought it outright - just recognizing what this movie represents is enough to watch and admire it.","24 March 2022",7,3,15
"Turning Red","Fun story. Keeps you on hook. Animations could have better. Good metaphor with the inner beast we all have. The burden of being an Asian kid. It feels too close to home that way. We think we fail being the perfect us by controlling the crazy aspects of our life but sometimes we need to let go.","23 March 2022",7,2,10
"Turning Red","I like how they feature lgbt children and violence towards your own parents, in the guise of 'freedom' and 'independence'. More like an dystopian nightmare that we're being steered into irl. Typical movie released by the mainstream nowadays.","31 May 2022",1,3,11
"Turning Red","Turning Red is about teaching young teenage girls that it is completely acceptable to behave irresponsibly by acting on new hormonal body changes. The movie is about 13 year old girls shaking their booties/butts whenever/wherever, fantasizing about relationships with guys/older guys, ignoring/disrespecting parents' protection and guidance/wisdom, letting their education/grades deteriorate under the guise that they believe that they are old enough to make their own decisions and be in charge of their own lives. This movie's undertone encourages mindless teenage pregnancies, and girls not staying focused on school/education and making better lives for themselves. The movie devalues parents' wisdom and even has the parent apologizing to the main teenage girl even though the intent of the parent is for the girl's protection and growth to becoming an educated, knowledgeable young woman. By the end of the movie, proud teenage girls who successfully belittled their parents' wisdom are free to do what they want with their new hormonal changes and lack of wisdom and intelligence.","14 March 2022",1,11,26
"Turning Red","My daughters really enjoyed seeing Canada represented, especially the currency!

It made me long for 2002 before the overcorrection of wokeness. I forgot what it was Iike to watch a new movie with my daughters that isn't loaded with forced representation, it's wholesome and that's awesome.","13 March 2022",7,4,11
"Turning Red","Loved the expressions and the story. Very cute and exciting. Vibrating and I think it's a great movie for everyone, not only for girls, everyone can enjoy it without saying it's not ""relatable"" I'm sorry if u are a white old man that can't understand,just by going through teenage years or parent pressure u can relate.","13 March 2022",10,6,16
"Turning Red","This movie should receive more respect and acknowledgment for what it is. The Animation is unique and authentic to the Asian culture it is representing. I really liked and admired this film for what it was. Highly recommend it to all ages and Disney fans especially!","12 March 2022",10,6,22
"Turning Red","As a asian viewer, this film was amazing that the telling story between parents and kids reflected a strongly traditional family membership.

The mother tries her best to cultivate her daughter despite so strict as she wanted even a Chinese traditiona teaching principle could violate the children's aspect of facing the social environment. But this did actually take place in asian families every minutes. Good grades, Patient, Polite are the fundamental to be required before you enter the society.","13 March 2022",,1,1
"Turning Red","I have no issues with the message nor the diversity (Toronto is a very diverse city, of course there will be Sikhs, etc) but sadly it feels like this movie is going to get review bombed by people who can't stand seeing straight white people

it should, however, be lowly rated because it just isn't good. It's way too fast paced, the humor feels subpar for a Pixar film and the message, while endearing, is extremely heavy handed. As I'm watching it, I can't help but think that it feels like a Disney movie than a Pixar-specific one.","11 March 2022",5,9,20
"Turning Red","The bar is so high with Pixar that a film such as 'Turning Red' would be dubbed a classic if it were made by any other studio.

I thought this was a good film, with some nice messages about the teenage experience, being the parent of a teenager, and also the importance of friendship.

I enjoyed it, though I seem to be in the minority.","23 June 2022",6,1,5
"Turning Red","Great animation but that's where it all ends. The characters were loud and annoying and the subject matter a bit specious. There is really nothing redeeming about the material or matters; nothing about this movie makes it worth watching ever again. The only thing it has going for it is that I have seen a lot worse from other production companies.","6 May 2022",4,2,5
"Turning Red","I have always loved Pixar movies. They are responsible for so many of my childhood memories and dreams. But the company took a different turn (pun very much intended) with this film. It is for mature kids and adults. The film touches on very suggestive and sensitive content. I watched this with my 6 year old daughter. She was so excited by the previews. I had to fast forward a few scenes because she is not ready nor capable of understanding some of the mature content. It is however a touching story and very funny. I'm just writing this review as a caution to parents with young children. However, on a technical standpoint the Animation is gorgeous.","12 March 2022",8,4,11
"Turning Red","Let's be honest . The movie was not as good as expected. Despite its interesting plot and animation, it does not make good use of what it has. Some parts make you say it's too exaggerated. You will really enjoy it if you pay attention to what to expect when you go to the movie. Because the movie is really sweet and funny. But it still doesn't even come close to the best pixar animations !","16 April 2022",6,2,3
"Turning Red","I have never jumped for the remote faster. I was watching the movie at the first mention of the girl getting her period. Not suitable for a nine year old girl. Did not think that I would have to screen Disney and Pixar. So many questions during the movie from my daughter. The main character is so disgraceful to her family. Do not recommend at all. Seriously can't believe that Pixar would put this out. Is this in response to the movie Soul?","14 March 2022",2,9,20
"Turning Red","The point of this movie is flying over a lot of these commenters' heads. I grew up in Toronto with many immigrant friends and it was so spot on. I'm convinced that people who can't relate are actively trying not to. If you can relate more to a toy or a car than a tween girl you might need some therapy.

It feels ""cringy"" at times because thats what being 13 is all about. Boy or girl you were cringy in middle school.

Yes periods are mentioned in passing but thats not what the red panda represents. Puberty is just a small part of what growing up and finding out who you are is all about.

The mom isn't ""crazy"" it's how some parents express their love, doing everything in their power to have their child be perfect and successful. Yes it can be problematic but that's clearly expressed in the movie.

No the message is not ""you should never obey your parents"". The message is ""its okay to not fit the mold your parents may try to force you into"". For parents the message is ""kids won't stay the same and you need to leave space for them to grow or risk loosing them"".

Clearly people have forgotten what it's like to be a kid and realize, wait a minute I don't like all the things my parents want me to like.

Also, the diversity isn't forced that's what downtown Toronto looks like. I loved seeing my life and my friends' lives depicted in a movie like never before. It warms my heart and makes my so happy knowing immigrant kids will see themselves in a movie for once. Yes there are movies about other cultures but none of them are about being an immigrant (or a 2nd generation immigrant) that's what makes this special.","15 March 2022",10,3,5

"Turning Red","While I can relate to Meilin and her friend group, since they remind me of me and my friends back in 1996...I lost interest from the concert to the end. It was, not good. I'm not sure if they were trying to be funny with all the bootay shaking. I don't know what would have been a better resolution, but what they went with didn't sit well with me. Onward and Luca did a better job with their endings. I wish someone could have spoken up and said ""no...this is cheesy, and doesn't flow with the story"".","12 March 2022",6,2,6

"Turning Red","Turning Red is a movie that starts its expedition, breaking the boundary of Pixar by going to a new height and presenting a new recipe in front of us. The journey starts in a vibrant and soothing way and goes on introducing new elements in front of us from this fresh world of Pixar. All the characters in the movie work like a strong spice which triggers our taste buds even more and makes us ask for more. Coming to the story it also tries a good amount to put something entirely new on the menu but some of the ingredients turns out not so new and also predictable from time to time. Director Domee Shi has created a presentation that pops many colors and increases our appetite not too fast or too slow but on a balanced state. Overall Turning Red stands out high in terms of being a good entertainer and fills you with many emotions which makes you wanna watch it once and then revisit it once again.","18 March 2022",7,2,10
"Turning Red","This movie gives a horrible message and is very stupid and idolizes furries to young children and makes children think it's not okay for them to follow their dreams and allow themselves to be sheltered by their parents and in return go behind their parents back to get what they want instead of being upfront. Over all should not waist your time on this movie complete waste of my time and anyone who watches it.","13 March 2022",1,16,51
"Turning Red","While I don't think this film is top tier Pixar from an objective standpoint, personally it has become one of my favorites because, even as a male, I can heavily relate to it's coming-of-age themes. Puberty was awkward and things felt like they were moving more quickly than before, me and my friends always acted cringe as kids but what mattered was that we had fun doing it and never cared about what other people thought of us as long as we weren't harming anyone, and I also have an overprotective mother and had serious issues with growing up and making my own decisions. The way this movie handles all of these topics is excellent and really resonates with me on a personal level. Also the movie is hilarious and it made me laugh very often. I really love the quirkiness and fast-paced route that this film takes. I also love that it takes risks and is not afraid to get into sensitive coming-of-age topics. I wasn't expecting myself to love this film as much as I did. It's so much fun throughout its entirety and it's something that I can completely get behind.","17 December 2022",8,1,2
"Turning Red","Watched Turning Red with the niece & nephew last night. We all enjoyed the movie, found it cute & funny, storyline was not my favourite but still decent. Being from Toronto, I really loved all the references, very fun to try and spot them all!! Really liked all the characters. Yes it's a metaphor for having your period, but it's so much more than that. Good for Pixar for normalizing it. Fun family movie.","13 March 2022",6,2,6
"Turning Red","Going into this movie, I was hoping for it to at least be good, but I wasn't sure based on trailers. I was extremely surprised and this movie did a lot of things I did not expect, but it definitely will not work for everyone.

Firstly, this is very bold from Pixar. A Pixar movie where tweens say sexy and stripper?? I don't mind those things but even I thought ""wow, that's gonna get backlash from some parents"". This movie very realistically portrays early teenage girls who are just starting to turn into the women they will be, and showing the conflict they have with parents who are not ready for them to change.

I grew up in an extremely strict Christian home, and I related to Mei more than I expected in this movie. And sure, she can be a little over the top and annoying, but that is the point- even one of her teachers describes her as annoying. When my wife was 13 her and her friends were obsessed with One Direction and she saw herself so much in Mei and her friends, it was scarily accurate.

I will say that the movie is a little long, but I really loved the visual style and presentation, and I thought it told a story from a perspective that is almost never seen, giving a voice to a very unique demographic. Most people probably won't be able to enjoy the movie the way I did, and that is okay, I wouldn't be surprised if some people hate it. But I genuinely think that this was a very heartwarming, relatable, funny, and well-presented story that I have showed a few friends that I knew would relate.","17 March 2022",8,2,7
"Turning Red","Oh look it's another coming of age rebellion film. We gonna switch it up by making it ASIAN style! Huzzah! How original! 94% Rotten Tomatoes worthy! Nevermind that 99% of the attempts at comedy fell flat, let's just go straight to the moral of the story. Which is that parents should ignore a kid's falling grades, violent tendencies, talking back, and acting irresponsibly because they are growing into their own person/monster and all should be accepted and forgiven cuz of... love. What a wonderful and inspiring film! Made me wish I Molotoved my high school poetry teacher's car instead of repressing my inner monster. I gots to be me yo! Best excuse in da world!","12 April 2022",3,2,5
"Turning Red","The idea of the film seemed very promising at first, extra points for rep and diverse characters, but the film fell flat for some reason. The humour was lacking, the storyline stretched and I didn't really enjoy it that much.","18 March 2022",5,3,6
"Turning Red","Good mirror for kids and grown-ups. For kids, lots is happening starting from the age of 12. Here at age 13, already looking to boys, have feelings and thoughts beyond first kiss? It mirrors the pressures that parents can put on their children, lying to your parents to still do what you want but still knowing what is right/wrong and of course the bully that actually has their own issues or secrets. I like the business mindset as well. Entrepreneurship at a young age. It is possible and I read that there are a lot of young people of the age of 15 that find ways to make money.

For parents this movie is a great mirror to realise that kids are getting mature between 12-14 years old. They need to listen and adapt accordingly. It nearly always comes down to the point that you raise your kids the same way you were bought up. Try to realise that kids grow up fairly quick in this rapid world. I think it was interesting to see that in order to control her emotions; she had to think about her friends and not her parents. She actually scratches her room and is in a state of constant panic when in her room. Some things are for friends and others for parents.

Communication and listening to your kids/parents, is always key before it gets out of hand. I think this may be a story/scenario known to many people.

Regarding the rest :) Great animation, great voice casting. I was a bit 'tired' about the Fluffy comment, as Despicable Me got away with that one. But I'm probably overthinking it as usual. And you know what, Miriam reminded me of Peppermint patty for some reason :) Very culturally diverse, which was cool.

The ending is prefect; afraid that changing will create a gap between parents and children. Only if you allow that to happen I think.

I think many associate this with 'coming of age', but for me it is much
more than that.","15 March 2022",7,2,10

"Turning Red","I found all the main characters to be very unlikeable. A moody 13 year old girl with a domineering mother and an overbearing grandmother. The story also relies heavily on some very Asian stereotypes.

To top it off, there is no real protagonist and the conflict only has to do with the typical teen/mother conflict.

Watch it if you like Pixar movies and are interested in the little Easter Eggs they throw in, but I didn't find it anywhere near as interesting as their previous movies.","21 March 2022",5,3,7
"Turning Red","Turning Red is a vivid and dazzling animated story of friendship, parenting, adolescence, and boy bands. Director Domee Shi makes her feature film directorial debut and gives us her unique take on puberty and parenting. Kids and adults alike will find this movie enjoyable given the relevancy of the topics and relatability of the characters.

Set in Toronto in 2002, this beautifully-animated movie follows Meilin ""Mei"" Lee (Rosalie Chiang), a confident 13-year-old girl who is torn between staying her overprotective mother's obedient daughter and being an independent person with her own interest. And if that is not enough, whenever she feels a powerful emotion, she turns into a giant, fluffy red panda.

The world-building is phenomenal, specifically that of the boy band that Mei and her friends are obsessed with. 4-Town, the boy band, perfectly captures the essence of a boy band with corny love songs, crazy fanatics and, of course, cute boys. Along with that, Turning Red captures the complexity of mother-daughter relationships across generations with both comedy and drama. The animation is visually stunning as it mixes Eastern and Western animation techniques together to make a fresh, new style while still staying true to Pixar's recognizable animation form and style. My favorite performances are that of Sandra Oh (Ming) and Rosalie Chiang (Mei) because there is such a strong chemistry between the characters in how the actors portray a real-life, genuine relationship.

The message of the movie is to honor your parents, but make sure to be your own person while doing so. The movie animates the idea of suppressing your emotions and personality for others. It also highlights the power of friendship and the key role it plays in your life.

I give Turning Red 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 7 to 18, plus adults. Turning Red releases exclusively on Disney+ on March 11, 2022. By Katherine S., KIDS FIRST!","13 May 2022",8,1,5
"Turning Red","""All is well that ends well, the chief conflict is between Mei and her strict mother Ming (Oh), whose own panda-repressing past casts a deep scar between her and her mother (Ho). Ming is a difficult character to devise in Shi's conceptualization, she cannot be a one-note villain, as someone who has experienced exactly what Mei is experiencing, she could've been more sympathetic. Her kaiju-sized panda indicates that her emotional compass is far more turbulent than others, she is a victim-turned-victimizer, but Shi and her collaborators give away nothing more about Ming's past, which leaves the story lean on the objectionable blaming-the-mother cliché.""

"Turning Red","* * *
Overall #TurningRed gives Animaniac's Katie Kaboom - meets the child-parent relationship of A Goofy Movie - meets Haku in Spirited Away - meets the friendship and antics of The Good Boys - meets Dani Moonstar in New Mutants

The film is cute-I won't take that away from it- but you can definitely feel the difference when compared to a movie like Encanto, or Inside Out which is why I think being released via streaming was a smart move.

Furthermore, it felt a little sloppy/lazy in the story department (in terms of cohesion and continuity), but the animation and Act 2 storyline is what saves it/gives it some engaging qualities.

It's not a Pixar film you need to make time to sit and watch, but if you happen to want some cute background noise as you do some work (or to occupy your children), it will serve its purpose in that way.

Highlight:
First, that symbolism of the Red Panda was superb! Also, the animation and visual effects were amazing (shout out to that slight flex with the cooking scene... absolutely beautiful). Lastly, Act 2 was possibly my favorite act of the entire film, and it felt the most cohesive.

Could've Been Better:
The character arcs and developments of Ming and Mei, as well as their relationship with one another, wasn't the best. They were the foundation to the story existing, but everything about them were rushed and reduced to quick generalizations for entertainment/engagement purposes.

The story also felt a little sloppy when looking at cohesion and continuity with Act 1-Act 2, and then Act 1 to Act 3. It felt like I had watched 2 different stories with Act 2 being the story the other acts needed help grasping onto.","13 March 2022",8,2,9
"Turning Red","You feel your neurons dying with this script and characters. I'm a bog fan of Pixar and all of their movies, yet this one was their biggest disappointment. The worst Pixar movie, ever.","14 March 2022",1,10,24
"Turning Red","I'm sure that everyone was skeptical about the idea of a girl turning into a red panda as Pixar's next movie but it really surprised me. Meilin was a lot of fun. Her personality was relatable and breaking the fourth wall was wildly entertaining. Her friends were amazing and supportive, the film's animation was vibrant and colorful like something out of a anime which is a first for Pixar and the themes of motherhood was so universal. ""Finding Nemo"" was a beautiful movie about a dad protecting his son. ""Turning Red"" is like ""Finding Nemo"" but about a mom and daughter. While ""Brave"" was telling a story about a mom and daughter relationship, it was lacking on the themes and the characters were bland to me. In ""Turning Red"", you felt the characters' emotions and the message is was telling. It had a lot of great female representation and finding out that it was led by Pixar's first female team made it more groundbreaking. DreamWorks did that with ""Spirit Untamed"" with a female led team and it was totally wasted. Pixar gave Domee Shi the freedom to have a female team on her movie and you felt all the hard work they put in the movie. I say ""Bravo"" to that. It was an amazing follow-up to ""Bao"" and did not disappoint. You're going to love it.","12 March 2022",5,4,18

"Turning Red","The new Pixar film is here (unfortunately not in cinemas) and being me, I'll check it out no matter what!, directed by Domee Shi who directed the Oscar winning short ""Bao"", which I found it to be the strangest short from Pixar, anyways this film looks pretty cute and could be creative, I kinda like the concept of it and this could be a nice heartwarming Pixar film, like most of their films, so it's on Disney Plus now and I gave it a watch and..., well it's not great or like a classic, but still has the same Pixar traits and charm that makes this film worth a while.

This is definitely a heartwarming film, especially the fact that Meilin (Rosalie Chiang) has her amazing three friends that she gets along with and her mother Ming (Sandra Oh), it definitely is relatable since Mei-Mei is going through a lot like wanting to see her favourite Boyband in town, but like lots of parents, they are in denial about that, so the child will be upset about that, but in this case, Ming is doing it for a good reason, but well... Mei-Mei gets turned into a Red Panda and I like the animation on her when she is turned into one, it's expressive and nicely designed, I love it, even the animation as a whole is... nice, the designs of the humans I'm still a bit iffy about but they are fast, nice enough to stand out and be different, which I like, I do like the city in Toronto, it's very nicely animated and bright, even with a few nods to anime which is cool, even the characters are really likeable and highly memorable with great voice work, along with 2000's nostalgia esc songs and a lovely score by Ludwig Göransson, the good sense of humour also helps with the feature too as it is rather loud and expressive which I quite like, the story is decent and has a good moral to it which anyone can relate to, i do like Pixar tries to add new elements to this story and the to movie as a whole still making it relatable but also creative and different, I do like the third act which is both epic and touching, along with a nice conclusion.

However there are just a few things that did bother me, like the concept of the movie has kinda been done lots of times before, but this one at least tried to stand out, but also sometimes it's weird humour does make the film a bit loud and annoying at times and I'm not a fan of the whole ""someone hides something by acting very suspicious, so the person goes away"", happens a bit too much in this film I think and once again, I'm a bit off put by the round head and big smiles in the characters, they look too much like Luca characters or from Steven Universe or The Amazing World of Gumball, it's a bit creepy.

But with all that, this is a pretty good film from Pixar, not a masterpiece or a classic, but better then a lot of their mediocre trash, it has the same elements that we expected from Pixar, it has the nice and creative animation, it's hilarious, it's got a very nice heart and relatability, likeable as heck characters with good voice work, a decent story and a lots of good music, but since the animation style is a bit off and sometimes it's humour and how it can be predictable, but even with all that, it's a solid film that I think fans will really enjoy and get into, I know I did, I hope the same can be said about the next feature...

I'm going to give Turning Red a 7.4/10.","18 March 2022",7,2,10
"Turning Red","In all honesty there is a part of me that thinks, as I read the other negative reviews, that maybe they don't like it because the main character is an Asian girl they just can't relate and hate on the movie. Or because some of them are prudes don't find the first 10-15 minutes of the movie funny because it deals with a girl going thru puberty. But it's probably both for those that give it 5 stars or less stars. So if you fall into either (or both) of those demographics you more than likely won't find it as enjoyable of a movie. I thought it was fantastic and almost cried laughing in the first part of the movie!","12 March 2022",10,3,6
"Turning Red","As a 27 year old woman, I felt such a connection to this coming of age, mother daughter story. I don't understand why there are so many comments calling it ""woke""? There isn't a single thing about this that is political. It's funny, relatable, quite moving at times, and to be honest it doesn't take itself too seriously. Which is super refreshing!! Give this one a watch! I'll be watching it again with my mother when I see her next!!","12 March 2022",10,5,18
"Turning Red","I did not enjoy this, but I'm also a 42yo gay male with no kids. Not it's demographic, but do I appreciate some firsts here. So many felt represented in a way where they normally are skipped over for the traditionally healthy, thin, beautiful characters. No medical conditions, blemishes, etc. That's important, but I can't imagine parents/adults thinking this is an entertaining film.

Also, ignore the blown out of proportion controversies involving anything they think kids needed to be shielded from. It's lies and conservatives doing what they do best. Being hypocrites and avoiding real things children face and need to be exposed to.","29 March 2022",6,2,7
"Turning Red","The movie starts with a fourth wall breaking introduction to the main character, Mei. She is precocious, overambitious, keen, and extremely annoying. The movie even points out how annoying the character is. She is pretty much controlled by her desire to impress her mother. The characters were much more nuanced than I expected, except that the mother is overly cringe beyond reason. Doing things so incredibly embarrassing for no reason seems unrealistic and was more stupid than funny. Regardless, the movie continues with the metaphor for puberty and change pretty well. The friends have just enough quirkiness that you like the characters but they're not quite annoying (except the shortest one who's always at 10/10 on every line...). The idea of family expectations crushing a young person's ability to be their own person is also pretty deep for a kids' movie. Everything comes together extremely well in the third act, especially Mei's relationship with her mother. I honestly have no clue if children would like this movie, but it's a surprisingly deep movie that adults can enjoy if they can put up with a few bits of cloyingly annoying preteens.","20 March 2022",8,2,8
"Turning Red","Pixar's new movie Turning Red is very cute and charming coming of age comedy, with beautiful animation and really good music by Ludwig Goransson and Finneas O'connell.

I couldn't really releate to this movie as much as like ""Souls"" or ""Onward"" and i do realise that this movie wasn't made for me, and maybe it wasn't the greatest Pixar movie ever made. But i still enjoyed it very much and it's defenintly worth watching solely for that panda. It maybe the cutest thing i have ever seen.","13 March 2022",7,2,7
"Turning Red","Many of the characters seem like they are written to be annoying, the ending of the film is extremely average, only redeeming character is priya. Because she is the only one that is some-what relatable, Abby is the most annoying character ever made, don't bother watching, you'd be saving yourself a night of boredom and to a point anger.","22 March 2022",3,4,8
"Turning Red","Don't take me wrong, it was a good movie, but the message is not right in it, disrespecting and arguing and fighting with your parents is wrong.

Kids will think fighting with your parents is right and they can do and say whatever they want, parents are there to guide you and teach you the right things, the good way to live your life.

Nice movie but not recommend.","12 March 2022",5,7,19
"Turning Red","What is it with the west always wanting to strip all eastern children of good values, decency and achievements and adorn them with western mediocrity and under achievement?

This movie highlights the struggles (I would say achievements) of an Asian child with an over bearing, high expectations mother who wants her child to exceed in all aspects. What's wrong with that?

In the west of your child isn't going to parties, drinking and having sex by 13, something is wrong with them. And this is what Pixar is now trying to promote to children. If you don't conform to western ideologies, you just don't fit in.

It's unfortunate more and more of our cartoons and animations are brainwashing our children to become Kardashians rather than Theresas.","15 March 2022",6,2,8
"Turning Red","I liked the movie until it casually threw in ""my panda, my choice,"" which is obviously referencing ""my body, my choice."" I think that's very inappropriate to blatantly promote this position in a child's movie. Not the place.","12 March 2022",,12,35
"Turning Red","I had to watch this twice cause I gave up the first time. I don't know why but I just didn't really enjoy the film that much compared to other Pixar movies. It's nice to see different people being represented in the movie though.","26 May 2022",6,1,3
"Turning Red","I'm sorry, but this film is bad.

For starters, as a Canadian, I will give this movie one credit;
This is indeed Canada.

Anyways, now let me say every last thing in this movie that I hate in point form:
I was 13, NOBODY acts like this.

This movie is boring.

Ming is a terrible mother.

All of the characters are misfires and half of them don't need to exist.

Why? Who came up with the Idea for this movie?

That's all I've got to say.","26 March 2022",4,3,8
"Turning Red","Sea Otters are number one, sorry red panda.

A coming of age animated feature set in Toronto. Being Canadian, although west coast, it was neat to see Canada get some love. Womanhood mixed with ancestral magic made for a entertaining movie with some good laughs at the late 90's/early 2000's expense. I could relate to many of those pop culture references all too well...","15 May 2022",7,1,5
"Turning Red","Turning Red may not be one of Pixar's best films, but it is a very servicable film.

I love the message and the characters and Mei's mom is very hilarious and did get better near the end. I wasn't expecting this one to get massive hate or backlash. It deserves better.

Better than Megamind, Free Bird and The Emoji Movie but not as good as Wall-E Up or Coco.","22 June 2022",8,1,5
"Turning Red","It seems that Pixar is hellbent on making every recent film teach us all heavy handed messages. While they presumably think they are sharing a universal truth, their messages are extremely western and millennial. Not everyone thinks this way.","12 March 2022",4,7,22
"Turning Red","A 13-year-old girl coming of age story, except where the ""coming of age"" parts are symbolized by a very real giant red panda.

I found the movie enjoyable and entertaining, but there was not a lot that personally connected with me as a 29-year-old male (despite being Canadian and being around the same age as the character at the time the movie takes place.)

Nevertheless, I think it is an important movie for today's 'tweenagers' who are going through similar physical and emotional changes that the movie does an excellent job of portraying.

It's not my favourite Pixar movie, but it is good. I think most people should view it, at the very least to have a better understanding of today's youth.","16 March 2022",7,2,13
"Turning Red","I'm an avid watcher -consumer I should say- of 'First Time Watching' reactions on Youtube. And so when ""Turning Red"" specials started popping by the dozens in a span of only two or three days, I knew I was dealing with a phenomenon. Indeed, unlike the more-marketed and Oscar-buzzed ""Encanto"", ""Turning Red"" seemed to come out of nowhere and if it wasn't for my stepson urging me to watch it, I might have waited ... at least one day more.

Now I kind of understand its popularity but also why it's only rated 7.1 on IMDb. Despite the flashy premise, the coming-of-age story of girl turning into an animal after a strong emotion, isn't exactly a novelty, not after ""Brave"" or ""Inside Out"" anyway. To rise above its inspirations, the film makes an honorable effort to push many boundaries and highlight the ordeal of being a teenage girl raised by immigrant parents. However, if there's nothing in ""Turning Red"" that should make director Domee Shi 'turn red', I deplore once again a case where the pencil is so sharpened the lead seems almost at the verge of breaking.

Naturally', Shi's totally entitled to tell the story of her adolescence and experience as a Sino-Canadian in 2002, like Greta Gerwig did with ""Lady Bird"", Toronto replacing Sacramento. But then the choice of the 'red' leitmotif left me perplex ... Shi explains it in the 'making of' interview and you get it from the ""turning"" word, subtlety isn't exactly 'Turning Red''s strongest suit or maybe it wasn't intended as a nuanced film to begin with since it deals with the most turbulent and tumultuous phase of our life. Still, I didn't necessarily needed her to reveal that the Panda metaphor wasn't just about natural characteristics (laziness, nonchalance) that could echo adolescence but other aspects such as hair, weight and (ugh!) smell.

The trouble with ""Turning Red"" is that the writers (including Shi) seemed so invigorated by an apparent taboo-breaking mission that it took the story to very improbable territories. Indeed, the trick with Disney and Pixar is that sometimes they take our suspension of disbelief for granted. In fact, that it would be the first Disney Pixar to refer to pads didn't bother me as much as ""Psycho"" showing a toilet seat for the first time, but that a mother would be so overprotective she would bring these things to her daughter's school was more ludicrous than the panda-thing. And keep in mind my skepticism is mostly driven by my sympathy to all the well-introduced main characters.

There's Mei (Rosalie Chiang) a smart, high on life, full of promises and confident girl turning 13, caught between the new codes of adolescence and peer pressure and her desire to please her mother equally proportional to her fear to disappoint. The mother is Mei Ling, voiced by Sandra Oh. Mei has friends of course, Miriam, labeled as a tomboy (Ava Morse), Abby (Hyein Park) and deadpan Priya (Maitreyi Ramakrishnan). And for once, the Asian friend isn't the minority member although according to Wikipedia, Abby is Korean and Myriam Jewish. Nothing against that but sometimes, the paradox of inclusiveness is that the further you take it, the closer it gets you to a reverse form of exclusion.

Anyway, Mei is basically stuck between two ages, two cultures, two life options, she's still that little child who should honor her parents, help her mother clean the temple but trapped in an Oedipal dilemma, she tries to find the strength to 'kill' symbolically her mother without hurting much her feelings. It's a mother-and-daughter-driven film where the father (Orion Lee) is reduced to a non-entity with a talent for cooking. Even as the ""good cop"" of the parental duo, he's overpowered by the Panda-connection that struck the female members of the family since the ancestor who awakened the inner panda that could protect the clan in the absence of men.

But before the whole furry freak-outs, the film goes well. I started cringing when Ming Lee found her daughter's cute drawings of her 17-year old crush... and what can I say about her reaction? Well, I had to undergo helicopter-parenting, this is NOT helicopter parenting except if you consider the offspring being tied to the blades. Mei feels humiliated, rightfully so, and the next day, she turns into a Panda. The trouble is that the film had made such a good effort to build characters that you expect a real discussion between the mother and the daughter but you know that wouldn't happen before the emotional climax... and so we need to have a little fun with the fur.

""Turning Red"" oscillates between some genuine moments that are so effective in their depiction of adolescence in 2002, the boys-band (although it struck me that these girls wouldn't be the kind to idolize them), tamagotchis, and first-generation cell-phones... a blessing for Mei (can you imagine her situation in 2020?) The depiction of the year I was 20 in was so spot-on that I regretted it had to waste its time on tropes we've seen in many Disney so far: a magic circle, a ritual, a transformation, not to mention the climactic fight manga style. The inner Panda becomes the metaphor for the beast inside exxcept the trigger isn't an army of invaders but an overbearing mother (technically an invader)... and the panda represents the emancipation from emotional restriction, the freedom to let your ego shout as loud as possible and that might be least 2002-esque aspect of the film. More 2020 in fact.

Speaking of which, reading many negative reviews on IMDb, I was wondering whether parents didn't feel 'triggered' a little but, some for the right reasons: yes, even at 13, kids should listen to their parents. Some for the wrong ones: maybe they wish they could have rebelled too and as a 'vengeance' keep the same toxic control on their children. I guess for all its imperfections, ""Turning Red"" does hit a sensitive chord... if it turned so many parents anger-red.","15 April 2022",7,1,8
"Turning Red","Cute visuals. But left wondering where is this going? Our kiddos were so excited for this one and we turned it off half way through. It didn't hold their attention. Bummer.","12 March 2022",4,1,1
"Turning Red","It's just the worst. I have watched all Pixar movies to date, and loved every single one of them. As each of them has a story that you can relate in one way or another, and they are also thought provoking.

But this one!!! Is just Boring.","20 March 2022",1,9,23
"Turning Red","I will be pretty honest I am surprised by some of the reviews can comments this movie is getting. These people clearly do not have teenage girls in their lives, because as a father of four girls 16, 14, 12, and 9, I can tell you we sat down as a family and absolutely loved this movie.

We laughed, we cried, we saw parts of each of those girls in everyone in our family. Even my wife loved it from beginning to end.

This is a great family movie and is absolutely hilarious! I cannot remember the last movie I laughed out loud over and over especially concerning the first 20 minutes of the movie.

Teenage boys probably won't enjoy it as much as teenage girls would I get that, but holy cow people do not trash this movie just to do it.

There are great lessons in this movie that every girl needs to hear such as don't judge yourself, the importance of picking good friends, and remembering that no matter how hard it may seem your family will always be the most important thing in your life.

This movie is a must watch and the more family you have to watch it with you the more you will enjoy it.

8.7/10.","17 March 2022",8,3,8
"Turning Red","Plot is stupid and have holes, no explanation about changing into panda it's a course, genetic or just magic? To much stereotypes and politic of representation.","15 March 2022",3,6,14
"Turning Red","There is a lot of dross to navigate through with reviews these days. On the one hand you have people who hate any film that dare cast any women or minorities, and on the other hand you have idiots who think casting a black woman as a white male Norwegian king is a somehow a prequisite to making a film or TV.

In the case of Turning Red, many of the negative reviews are coloured by the former form of idiocy, like one person claiming the film takes place in a ""woke fantasy"" where ""most"" of the population wears turbans. Actually I found it to be a pretty damn accurate depiction of the wonderfully diverse population around Toronto's Chinatown and Kensington Market area, and the person who claimed that two people with head coverings represented ""almost the entire population"" was being hysterical. The main inaccuracy I found was the idea that a wealthy kid from what appears to be the Rosedale area would be going to a public school in the area the film centres around, just because they wanted a wealthy student as part of the plot -- not that a super wealthy kid was needed.

So getting to the substance: It was thankfully nowhere near the metaphor for menstruation than I was led to believe, nor the kids as smug as some positive reviews led me to believe. But one critique that was spot on is that the film seems to be geared primarily to young girls, so it wasn't the sort of enjoyable experience for the whole family I'd expect from Pixar. If anything I found it dull, my young daughters found the boy band (and the characters' obsession with them) annoying, it didn't hold their attention that well, and it seems those who would most identify with it's coming of age theme would be those with a mother, like the one in the film, who is emotionally abusive and cold.

Not a horrible film, but one I couldn't really actively recommend for any audience.","20 March 2022",,2,7
"Turning Red","The film was good. As an Asian I felt really related while watching it. The role and pressures of the child in the family, in community and all those hopes we carry on. There was brightfull corlors, enjoyable character developing, and music. OMG boy band idol was a thing when you was a teenage girl.

Most of all red pandas are really cute don't you think?","16 March 2022",7,2,8
"Turning Red","Clichè, stereotypical characters, and woke story elements ruin a very beautifully animated movie! We see it time and again that when a good story idea is turned into a political statement the fun goes right out the window and you're left with a mess like this. It looks like Pixar is afraid of portraying boys as boys and girls as girls and it's a darn shame from the studio that gave us Toy Story and Cars and Up! It was cringy to watch this with my kids and that's when you know Pixar lost its main audience! First Pixar movie I will not get on Blu-Ray!","13 March 2022",4,6,19
"Turning Red","My Panda, My Choice!!!

Pixar's latest animation entry Turning Red is a coming-of-age film helmed with an original & creative plot and funny characters. The film tries to highlight multiple social topics like changes in children in puberty, anger management, parenting, etc. But unfortunately doesn't give full justice to most of them. The film does have its moments too. The cheerful characters and colourful animation keeps us invested most of the time. I loved the chemistry among all four girls and the way their friendship is being portrayed.

But the film suffers largely due to its poor-unpolished screenplay. As a viewer, I didn't quite understand the motive behind the way the mother's character is being shown here. The sudden contradictory changes in her behaviour before the climax doesn't match with her portrayal in the rest of the film. The film also fails in touching our hearts and conveying a life learning message in a simple & effective way for which most of the Pixar films are known.

In finality, Turning Red is an average addition to Pixar's filmography. It's not extremely disappointing but doesn't hit hard as a Pixar film should. With a little fewer expectations you can check out this film.

"Turning Red","Just trust me and watch it. You will absolutely love the ""calarts"" style everyone complains about, the coloring, the animation, the music etc. Its probably one of pixars best movies to date.","23 March 2022",10,4,8
"Turning Red","Notin compares to this bright beautiful inspiring and breath takin movie, no don't get me wrong it's wat it's, but c'mon being yourself is the big package here and it was executed perfectly do yourself the best you can, the experience was Disney the work was Disney and now i feel Disney too here i liked everything about the animation this 1 was all out i felt the intensity the brain and the movement in the scenes awww it's just to much.","16 March 2022",8,2,14
"Turning Red","I loved Turning Red. Although not everyone will feel the same way, I personally connected with some of the situations Mei faces in the movie. When I was a young teen, I remember having to face the strangeness of growing up and trying to figure myself out. Nevertheless, it was always friendships and music that helped me just like in the movie. Disney + Pixar + anyone behind creating Turning Red did a fantastic job representing that. I should also point out that there was wonderful use of symbolism and I loved everything about it. I would definitely recommend watching it if you are looking to feel nostalgic about your early teen years. Also I recommend watching it simply to admire the thoughtfulness put into this movie.","27 March 2022",10,3,8
"Turning Red","How miserable does one have to be to try to tear apart a movie like this? This is one of Pixar's most unique and personal stories. It also hits on some resonant themes that we all have gone through, and is visually stunning (and stylistically unlike other Pixar movies.) I found no flaws. This movie should've gone to theaters.","14 March 2022",10,4,15
"Turning Red","After watch the movie tralier, already so enticipate to watch it.

The red panda is so cute and adorable, i immediately love it so much.

The animation drawing is pixar high level, many design also very nice.

The facial expression drawing style is different with other pixar animation. Kind of comedy type. I like that type style, look more cute and fun.

The movie background is around 2002, canada,
the main actor is chinese canadian with traditional family.

About a goofy, naive teenage student life. Have lovely friends, true friendship.

It all also attract me to watch.

A few scene is funny and make u laugh. Overall is quite good experience to watch the movie.","12 March 2022",10,5,25
"Turning Red","Turning Red not only brings nothing new to the table, but also executes its premise with a passion that looks like a potato with potassium-deficency.

This movie is not good, Pixar went from the best guys on making animated pictures to a disgrace to the genre; comparing Turning Red to movies this year The Bad Guys and Encanto really makes Pixar look like they think that competition isn't fierce anymore, but it is, and it's getting more hot, if Pixar does not change its structure they are bout to fall deep into a downward spiral.

+Pixar is appealing to the Chinese audiences bc MONEY!!!","19 March 2022",1,7,17
"Turning Red","I don't understand all the controversy or hatred for this film. There is nothing here that I would consider offensive. It isn't a great movie, however. It's a middle of the road Pixar film. It fails to reach the heights of Inside/Out, Wall-E, or Toy Story 3. The first two thirds of this movie are pretty entertaining and tells a good story about how your emotions, your body and your relationships change as you enter your teenage years. The last third is a hot mess. It feels rushed and a lot of the decisions the characters make don't make a lot of sense. Also the character of Abby, one of Mei's best friends might be the worst/most annoying character in Pixar or Disney history. There's a great story hiding in this film, unfortunately it gets lost in some chaotic scenes and strange character motivations.","22 March 2022",6,1,3
"Turning Red","The movie over all is greatly made, but it has few flaws that annoy me to the core. #1 issue I have with this movie is how it promotes female abusiveness. The dad of Mei gets abused by his wife all the time throughout the movie. It's always something to promote and now everyone got too comfortable looking down and talking down to men. I do not appreciate putting this into movies, especially into PG, where kids sponge off everything they see.","17 March 2022",5,5,11
"Turning Red","It was a fun and yet thoughtful movie that showed how difficult it can be to navigate family and friends while going through that very difficult time right before adulthood. It brought back a lot of my own thoughts and feelings at that age.","17 March 2022",10,5,13
"Turning Red","Came in with an open mind and it just wasn't entertaining. It felt like a crowdsourced group of parents wrote a plot that was specifically trying too hard to connect with their teen who isn't interested in hearing about a life lesson.","1 May 2022",2,3,6
"Turning Red","A coming of age film that seems to be aiming itself squarely at the early/pre teen age bracket - Turning Red is about a young girl called Meilin who goes through a change... into a big red panda. I get that the film is using this as a metaphor for the real life changes that happen to young teenagers, and I applaud it for attemping to get that conversation going, but that aside the film doesnt really bring anything new or exciting to the table, and what it does provide just feels like its been done before, and better. Regardless, its still decent, and my young daughter loves it... but from my point of view, after seeing practically all of Pixars films it does seem like thry are running out of ideas...","15 May 2022",6,1,5
"Turning Red","Movie is called 'turning red' and is about a teenage girl experiencing hormonal changes during her first menstrual cycle. If you didn't get that right from the off, you are clearly a man, lol.

A mix of classic Pixar animation mixed with cartoon style anime.. something I didn't love.

Didn't really enjoy the storyline either, although I appreciate that it's original, unspoken of and sends a good message. However, too 'teenagery' for me.","14 March 2022",6,3,17
"Turning Red","This movie, though cute and contains some silly moments, will most likely be enjoyed by pre-teen/teen girls. That's certainly not a bad thing, it just limits the audience. This movie contains good lessons for girls coming of age, but seems to lack anything more than that.","11 March 2022",3,9,26
"Turning Red","I'm surprised at the amount of sheer hatred that this movie has, it wasn't that bad. Some of the parts I found out-landish and seemed kind of out-of-the-blue, but other then that, there's good morals and fun characters.","9 May 2022",6,1,2
"Turning Red","Who ever wrote this screenplay was exceedingly preoccupied with the ideology they wanted to promote rather than focusing on writing a good story. This surely is one of the most forgettable works by Pixar.","29 June 2022",1,6,13
"Turning Red","Pixar has just hit another home-run with this clever family film about a young girl who goes through lycanthropy; every time her emotions get out of control, she transforms into a giant red panda. The film is smart enough to compare this as an allegory for puberty even down to the details of the glamour surrounding the boy band 4*Town. The jokes hit bullseyes, the animation is impressive and the music fits the time period of 2002. Two massive thumbs up!","12 March 2022",10,3,13
"Turning Red","Disney is simply the best out there in terms of animation, specifically Pixar films. Yes, many animated films have come out from other studios that deserve higher praise for sure, but the consistency of Disney/Pixar animation has always been unmatched. Turning Red is Pixar's latest release, once again going straight to Disney+ and it's once again another delightful film by the studio. I'll try to keep my bias of having lived in Toronto at one point and still living in the vicinity of it to the side, but seeing a major animation feature taking place there put a huge smile on my face. Here's why I believe Turning Red should not just be seen by its demographic but seen by all ages.

Following Mei Lee (Rosalie Chiang) a 13-year-old girl on the brink of puberty, Turning Red is really about the exploration of what happens to your body, but in a much lighter and fun way. After turning 13, she begins to sense her body changing. As soon as she feels any kind of excitement, her body transforms into a giant red panda. Mei's insanely overprotective mother wishes for her to keep this a secret, as it's a family issue that has been dealt with before. This eventually leads to an emotional climax, but at its core, this is a film about Mei and her friends, just trying to live their lives.

Where this film really sold me was the friendship between the four main young girls. It felt very authentic to how kids act and talk today. On top of that, making them the outsiders so that the entire school can think Mei is incredible when they finally see the Panda was a great touch. This type of story has been told before, but it's always refreshing to see it done well. This is also one of the more mature subjects that Pixar has tackled in a while, which was very nice to see.

Overall, where the film leads is pretty much exactly what I expected and there weren't a tonne of surprises, but the main twist did get me. I also am a huge advocate for a major studio believing that one of their employees deserves a bigger shot. Domee Shi (who also co-wrote the screenplay) directed the short film Bao for Disney a few years ago and it was one of the better ones in years. On top of that, she has been around in and around the studio for many years, working as a storyboard artist on films like Inside Out and Toy Story 4. She has now made one of Pixar's catalogue films and I believe it more than deserves a spot on the list. Turning Red is very straightforward in terms of how everything plays out, but it's still great. It's now streaming on Disney+ and I recommend it.","29 March 2022",8,1,8
"Turning Red","I would rather stare at the wall the whole day instead of watching this garbage 🗑.

Seriously, who on earth gave this garbage this score?😑
I don't even know what to say 😕","15 April 2022",2,2,7
"Turning Red","M 13 myself, and the reason why I love this movie is because I could relate to Mei so much, and it's just a really fun movie. I totally understood Mei with the awkward feeling of puberty, being embarrassed at school, bullies, being unfamiliar with your body (at first), and let's not forget being torn between being an obedient child or a rebellious teenager like your friends. The characters also felt really original with their own styles and personalities, and they're easy to like. Priya was my favorite. Even though this film was set in 2002, it oddly feels like my middle school today. I honestly have no criticisms for the film. Pixar rarely ever makes a bad movie.","15 March 2022",10,2,3
"Turning Red","Pixar never fails to make me smile, this is an exceptional and unique story. I could rewatch this several times😂! I loved the how each character was represented and how different this story if from other pixar films. I really recommend watching it.","21 March 2022",10,2,6
"Turning Red","It's not as bad as it made out to be, sure it's not perfect, I found it fairly enjoyable and really loved the animation style and voice work. It's reminds me in many ways to one of my favorite movies Teen Wolf 1985, starting the amazing Michael J. Fox. It's very similar, but not a copy and paste as others have poorly pointed out. Sure it's about growing up and transformations are uncanny but it's giant red panda, instead of a werewolf. And like Teen Wolf Meilin almost loses herself to it and the popularity it brought her at school, in a very similar fashion, but that's it. Overall I didn't hate it, didn't love it, just good. And might watch it again.","2 April 2022",6,1,4
"Turning Red","I made this account on IMDB just to leave this review so that parents know that this is the only animated movie I've seen in a LONG time which will make your child see you as a human, not their enemy (or dead) unlike most animated movies. Highly recommended for both children and adult women. If you have a daughter, see this movie. It will help you understand her better. At least if you care about her. Because young girls and their happiness is important. And a loving parent should know that.

I wish I had such supportive parents as shown in the movie. Usually animated movies show orphans as main characters. This was a lovely change. The mother and father both are shown as good characters and loving parents. What every child deserves to see in movies. Not all mothers are either dead or evil. Some just want what's best for you and they can be overbearing because they are human but they still love you. This movie humanizes parents AND the children and helps both realize that at the end of the day: they both love each other. Which is very important to remember as a family. I think a lot of Western movies don't show this. I hope this movie helps parents understand that sometimes it's okay to allow your adolescent daughter to be exactly that: an adolescent girl.

I loved this movie soooo much I cannot explain it. Though it is for young girls, I highly recommend adult women watching it, especially with their mothers or a parent who has raised you. My childhood self felt SO SEEN by this movie. I too, was obsessed with a boyband during that age and wanted to go to concerts and sleepovers that I wasn't allowed to. Wanting to be the perfect daughter for your mother and have her approval is something all Asian girls can relate to. SO relatable and so true. This movie will help heal your inner child. It will help you process the young girl you used to be, and the woman you want to become. I live in a Conservative Asian country and the old fathers and mothers were laughing along with me and my fiancé. If you're not 60, this is a movie for you. In fact I'm going again and taking my 60 year old mother with me.

Oh, and the animation is ADORABLE. The characters are so fun, they remind me of my own friends in school. They were so loving and friendly and protective, just like the girls shown in this movie. Clearly the creator has a healthy relationship with girls and parents and wanted to show that.

What terrible reviews people are giving this movie for NO reason at all. Its a children's movie, the target audience is adolescent girls and GROWN MEN are whinging about this movie. How shameful. I think you must not know what it's like to have a loving relationship with your parents and to see them as HUMAN. I know western families struggle with this. But it was a wonderful movie and the insight into Asian culture was lovely. Though I am South Asian, our cultural values are very similar and I saw that on display in the movie. Matriarchs like the grandmother are very common in Asian households. I could relate a lot to the family coming together to help a family member in need. I like this about our culture. We don't let anyone down or struggle on their own. We carry each member with us and on our backs. No man left behind. I think men are complaining about this movie because they can't relate to doing this for a family member. Western societies are very unnecessarily individualistic. I think you could learn a few lessons from this movie and learn to put an adolescent girls interest above your own. It won't hurt you.

If you see this review, do see the movie.","26 March 2022",10,5,11
"Turning Red","Movies as Luca and Soul were amazing (last 2 movies from Pixar), so i was actually excited for Turning Red. But expectations were NOT met. Very childish for a coming-off-age movie. Annoying characters, not many funny moments, simple visuals, nothing special. Too bad honestly.","26 April 2022",4,2,4
"Turning Red","Tbh, it's overrated as hell, I just kind of cringed a lot.

While it's a classic high budget Pixar movie, I think it's very overrated, I see people that are young adults to middle aged saying ""this is relatable"", or ""it is the perfect 1# Disney movie"".

When In reality, it has like 6 cringy montages in the first few minutes.

It's very exaggerated, basically just a bunch of fictional characters, most with annoying voice actors, obsessing over boys for the first few minutes.

And I understand it has some meaning (though I'm not interested in looking into it), but you'd need to be a very specific person to genuinely ""love"" this.

And don't even get me started on the comedy, just some jokes every now and then, but not enough to get a laugh out of most normal people.

But I will give it points for good animation, cinematography and lighting.

But anyway, this is kind of my opinion, maybe some people like this.

I don't really know what else to say, it's just one of those movies that embarrasses me to watch, cringe worthy...
I probably just feel like delegating this movie from my memory for being so overrated.","19 March 2022",3,3,7
"Turning Red","The most vocal crowd weighing in on this film is not the target audience. That's one strike. The criticism against the animation are unfounded, and any cg artist worth their salt will agree. That's two strikes. Finally the Pixar pantheon is indeed not what it used to be, but calling ""Turning Red"" the period metaphor that broke Disney's back is absurd. That's the third strike.

Meilin (Rosalie Chiang) is a young daughter of chinese immigrants living in Toronto, during the early 2000's. One day, Mei is suddenly able to change into a giant NHL mascot sized fluffy red panda, the trigger being the fluctuation of her emotions.

The story here is a personal one. Told between her pressures at school to succeed, her overbearing mother, boys boys boys boys and her tightly knit friend group, all of whom are oozing with personality. At the core of this story we have a girl becoming a women which metaphorically tap dances in red panda shoes. Its easy to see those that dream of toy sized epics and beautiful undersea odysseys, feel left out in the cold. Lambasting anything that doesn't adhere to their own childhood memories.

That's not to say ""Turning Red"" doesn't manage its own expectations. With a bombastic kaiju final act and enough gags to keep you smiling, the only real divide between older Pixar movies and this one, is the male dominated narrative. Domee Shi has packed in enough heart and cute anime influence to power a small dragon con. But where the film actually stumbles is in its execution. Where plot threads start to dangle, and misdirection is missing, we're left with blunt lines of dialogue to clearly forecast what the final challenge is that Mei must overcome. In the end its more of a Disney commandment, than a creative one. Slicing time off a film in the name of short attention spans, like a careless butcher carves up carcasses.

With a beautiful pastel look, absolutely stunning animation (including the awe inspiring meticulously rendered Panda fur) and a heart melting journey of family and adolescent change, ""Turning Red"" is not the big red beasts its made out to be. Instead, its a cuddly red one that offers a warm soothing hug.","5 July 2022",8,1,3
"Turning Red","Going in with low expectations made think this movie was going to be terrible but me and my girlfriend both laughed and then cried our eyes out watching this movie.

If you have controlling parents who have dictated parts of your life this movie will be 10/10.

If you have a controlling nature and you want your kids to be little versions of yourself then this movie is gonna be a tough pill to swallow, especially if you want to watch it with your kids.","17 May 2022",10,2,5
"Turning Red","The perfect blend of laughter and tears, TURNING RED shows the true sides and struggles of girls coming-of-age and their parents who have to learn how to let go. A wonderfully written and beautiful film.","13 March 2022",10,7,16
"Turning Red","This was so much fun!! The animation was amazing and i just had so much fun watching it! I do wish they tackled the theme of being different from your strict family a bit better but it was fun nonetheless!","12 March 2022",9,3,7
"Turning Red","I totally did not expect this movie to be good, I only looked for 5-7/10 would do the job for my Friday night. But this movie is outstanding!!!

It tackles the childhood traumas that many children experienced not just about puberty. It's about responsibility and expectation from family too!

So many good lessons in this movie to learn and remember.

Also, the movie is so goofy that makes me laugh so many times!

Art and animation is always top notch!!

Good job Pixar studios and Pixar artist!","12 March 2022",10,2,4
"Turning Red","I'm clearly not the target audience. Not 13, not a girl, not a child of an abusive mother, and I've never generically referred to my friends as ""girl"" (or ""boy"", for that matter), I've never lost my mind obsessing over boy bands or imagining them having fish tails. I don't get why each of the main characters have such one-note personalities: Angry girl. Bored girl. Annoying overachiever. Sad dad. Tiger mom...

If you want a good recent Disney movie, go watch Encanto again. Or Raya, or Frozen 2. Those are excellent. This is an easy pass.","20 March 2022",,3,8
"Turning Red","So recently I've noticed a huge problem with Disney/Pixar's marketing. The trailers for all of their recent films have been so bad that I had no hope for the movies. But I saw them anyway, and was really pleasantly surprised to find that they were so much better than their mediocre trailers.

That's why I was a bit disappointed to find that this one is basically exactly how it looks in the trailer.

On the positives, the animation was flawless as always from Pixar, I liked the ending a lot, Mei's father was a good character, and her friends were really nice too. (a lot nicer than real teenagers, I can tell you that much)

Unfortunately though, the rest of the characters were much less appealing. Mei herself is ok, although she can be slightly annoying at times, and I have to say, her family (apart from the dad), are completely horrible right up until the end of the film.

Also, although I am the right demographic that should be feeling nostalgia from this, I just didn't. Relatability is totally subjective, and I don't need to relate to a movie at all to find it enjoyable. But at the same time, I think the main point of this movie is to speak to the audience about these personal struggles of growing up, and since I didn't experience any of these things, a big chunk of the film just kind of goes over my head.

At the same time, I'm sure this aspect of it might really appeal to the people that can relate, so I don't think it's so much a flaw, as something that will be hit or miss depending on who's watching.

Finally, I can see this getting a lot of praise, but for me, the whole periods/puberty thing was a bit thinly veiled. I know the film is about growing up, but there are other films that deal with the same subject but in a much more subtle way.

Overall, it definitely wasn't awful, and there were some things that I liked a lot, but also a lot of things that didn't land for me either.","17 March 2022",6,1,6
"Turning Red","While I don't think I am the target audience for this movie, I could still appreciate it for what it is. Which is a good movie for kids (Mainly girls in this movie) who are growing up and dealing with family issues.

The animation in this movie is beautiful, as is to be expected from a Pixar production. The vice acting in this movie too, is insanely good. The characters feel very real and relatable, especially if you are / have been in their age range.

So, overall Turning Red is a stellar addition to the Pixar movie lineup. Even if I might not connect with the movie on the same level as a lot of other people will, I still liked this movie for what it was. I might not re-watch it for a while though.

On a sidenote, the Red Panda in this movie was adorable.","27 June 2022",7,1,5
"Turning Red","For the first time, I actually agree with the movie critics. This movie will still be special, even after not only the hundredth viewing, but forever. Sure, the interest will die down, but many will keep it in their hearts, myself included.

Turning Red is one of those movies that grabs your heart and throws it around like a football. It is, like I said, a rollercoaster of emotions. If you're planning to watch it, then I beg you, please just do it. You only either discover a new favorite, or waste 1 and a half hour of your day.

Not everyone can relate to the themes in the story, but movies aren't always about relating, they're about feeling too. If you have even the least bit of humanity in you, then you'll be able to sympathize and empathize with the characters in the movie. I say this because I'm a guy. A GUY. I may not relate to some of the girl things shown, and do note that there are *very* very girl things discussed (like periods,) but my goodness, did I enjoy it.

I mentioned that periods were discussed in the movie, and that, in my opinion, is... not a problem at all. This is a coming-of-age movie tackling puberty, and it doesn't strive to be for everyone. If you think that periods are best kept a secret, and discussions about it a taboo, then go ahead and trash the movie, but welcome to 2022 people. No longer do we have to bury natural processes like we did a century ago.

There are deeper themes in the movie besides puberty, which might I add, is NOT the focus at all of this movie. Most of the deeper themes are seen after the first 30 minutes of the movie, and from puberty, the focus shifts to being yourself. I will not say anymore, as I think that YOU should try to interpret the themes of the movie and think about it on your own.

All in all, this movie wins a solid 11/10 for me, and I have already put it in a special place in my heart. Watch in HDR for more pop, but even in SDR, the movie remains colorful.

Have fun!","31 March 2022",10,2,4
"Turning Red","I love my Disney films but I did not enjoy my time. Mostly due to the characters. Mei is and her friends are annoying brats. The only character I like is Ming. But I don't like that she is an antagonist. The puberty is handled poorly. Don't watch this just watch Encanto, TMNT 2012, Bojack Horseman, and Total Drama All Stars instead.","28 May 2022",2,3,7
"Turning Red","If I didn't know this was a Disney/Pixar film going into it, I wouldn't have believed it. The characters were annoying, it was very much not appropriate for young kids, and the main message was ""do whatever you want, regardless of other people."" I'm all for being true to yourself, but I think most people would agree that there's a reason teenagers aren't actually full-fledged adults yet. I also really hated Pixar's take that parents are essentially brainwashing their kids if they set any boundaries or rules (it basically says this in the first 5 minutes).

The one plus side to this movie is the dad's character. I hated in Luca that the dad was a bumbling idiot that was not aware of his child at all. The dad in this movie was the only character I didn't hate at the end, he was an involved and loving parent (not something Disney/Pixar shows very often).

I generally appreciate coming of age type movies, but this one pushed the period and sexual stuff way too much to be a kids movie. Glad I watched this one alone, not quite ready to explain what gyrating means to my 7 year old.","9 April 2022",1,3,5
"Turning Red","Even though it doesn't reach the heights of some of Pixar's best films, it's still a pleasant enough way to spend 100 minutes. It is a sweet and relatable story about what it means to grow up, but not apart. It all works beautifully. And the animation is brilliant.","13 June 2022",8,1,5
"Turning Red","I don't understand why people hating on this movie? The animation? Yes sure it looks different, but it matches the style and the story of this movie. This movie is supposed to be cringey to potray ourselves on puberty era. This movie is really original and creative, sadly it went to streaming services, what a shame. Keep it up Pixar!","12 March 2022",10,3,6
"Turning Red","After having read all these negative reviews, I thought it was about time I actually watched the movie.

I thought it was beautifully animated. The animation was so smooth and realistic it really brought the settings and characters to life with the realistic and very emotive facial expressions and vibrant colours. That along with the voice acting really made the characters seem real and alive.

I thought the story was very well crafted and it was a beautiful tale of generational trauma/pressure, coming of age, growing up and all it entails, managing friendships and the changing of mother daughter relationship as daughter grows up. I thought it handled all these topics really well. It perfectly (to the point it was scary) encapsulated the teenage girl experience of growing up and hitting puberty and experiencing all kinds of changes that you go through. Being a tween/teen girl and going through puberty is an awkward, difficult, cringy, messy time and you do experience all kinds of irrational emotions and the worst of times and you do start having crushes on boys. I don't understand why people found this movie so unrelatable. I found it so relatable it was scary, but that's what made the movie so damn great was that it was so so relatable and the characters were really brought to life with animation, expression and voice acting. I thought it was such a fun and light hearted movie that is great for kids especially (but not exclusively) for tween/teen girls.

I think it's really important to have a film like this that doesn't shy away from the reality of young girls' experiences all over the world. The pressures of being perfect and good enough and meeting all the sky high expectations of your parents, the embarrassment and discomfort of getting your first period (only embarrassing because we're made to be ashamed of periods but movies like this are so vital to fighting that's stigma), the wrestling with new and very strong emotions and expressing said emotions in unhealthy ways, the changing dynamic of mother daughter relationship, the crushing on boys and drawing fan art.

the ""controversial"" bits: mei says 'sexy' once in reference to the drawings she makes of her and the local store clerk. She says it in a way that makes me think she's heard the word before and doesn't quite know what it means because the drawings were not in the slightest suggestive or sexy. I don't think there was anything else at all offensive or inappropriate at all in the film.

lastly the film *does not* teach children to run away or disobey parents, it displays how Mei's mum Ming has way too high expectations for Mei (which is a generational thing we find out later as Ming's mum has way too high expectations for her too) and how Ming is very strict and that being way too strict (to stop your children disobeying) can actually make your children rebel more and lie more because they feel so trapped and stifled. And I think this is the reason why so many parents dislike this movie. Because they think parents should be blindly obeyed and that parents always know what's right when that's not the case because parents can be wrong as shown in the movie because parents are just humans at the end of the day. The movie perfectly displays that actually parents can learn something from their children.

A great movie for all the family. I really recommend.","9 April 2022",10,1,1
"Turning Red","I do not want to spoil the movie, but it carries a lot of dangerous messages in both overt or concealed way.

It is especially concerned about how should you (as a teenager) be disrespectful with your parents and disobedient.

It characterizes the teenager as the hero and the mother as the main antagonist, while in fact the reverse is the true thing.

The worst thing is that, schools are playing it for kids.","21 April 2022",1,4,15
"Turning Red","I consider myself as American not anything but American in spite of being born to Taiwanese (Chinese) parents. I can relate to the kid because being a perfectionist sucks.

My only problem is the focus is on the Chinese-est Western Chinese American/Chinese Canadian, etc.) cultural issue. I hardly feel like the perfectionist theme only applies to Chinese Westernized children. The perfectionist theme spans across cultural lines here in the US and likely in other Western countries. Kids are super a$$ed college bound, or at the least the kids I am interacting with and the kids are super duper stressed out by being perfectionist. Neurotic helicopter parents aside or included.

I think another poster mentioned in his/her review that everything is becoming to ethnic centric, which peeves me. Disney movies whether it's Disney, Pixar, Marvel; everything is so hyper focused on a specific culture background like a fictional African nation, to Chinese, to Columbians. Inclusion of various cultures and people in moves definitely needs to occur which I agree with by 1,000%. My only problem these ethnic centric movies manages to exclude me and my family because I see issues that cross cultures, age, and gender. Does my niece and nephew experience less trauma of coming of age because they are biologically half European descent? Are they deficient because they aren't full on Chinese (biologically or culturally).

I don't know, I think the art of the actual movie itself was great but the story onto itself is blah.

By the way, the movie threw me off because the story line occurred 20 years ago. I am old and I was flipping out about some of the old tech and fads that were going on....not the boy bands but that little electronic pet thing? Really?????","12 March 2022",5,3,6
"Turning Red","First thing I want to get straight is that, I am a teenaged
boy and probably the last kind of person who would enjoy this kind of film, yet despite all the negative reviews of this movie, I still thoroughly enjoyed it and wouldn't mind watching it again. I'm serious. This movie, had a great tone and animation that made the setting and characters feel so marshmellowy and cute (I love the way Ming runs it's just so full of energy) plus the characters were so enjoyable! I loved the chemistry and banter amongst the girls and the relationship between the girl and her mother was a mix between cute but also suspenseful which gave them a bit more depth than if they just went one way or the other. I could go on and on about the little details that this movie included with the writing, characters, and setting but I'd rather you watch the film and form your own opinion.

Now I want to talk about one more thing, which isn't really about the film but is about most of the Pixar films nowadays that are supposedly, childish, or bland, or mediocre, which is just one big lie. Soul and Luca, took big risks to tell stories about sexuality, the meaning of life, not feeling like you are worth a damn and many other messages and themes which relate to both kids and adults. What kind of themes came from Toy Story? Or a Bugs Life? Or Cars? To not have your expectations too high? To learn to be a good sport? To be different? Those are all basic kids themes, yet those films are seen as deep and complex yet their not really nowadays. Pixar was never remembered for their themes but rather their characters which could be identified and scrutinized by even a little kid just because of how unique and different they were. Toys, monsters, fish, etc. We're never the focus of a movie until Pixar saw life in them, and gave them purpose and goals which made inanimate objects seem even more human than a human. Pixar was remembered for their value of human life which people have forgotten since they want to be taken seriously when Pixar is trying to make your less serious and more contempt.

Whenever, I see people saying Pixar is dead, well guess what, your wrong, they are still hitting home runs and are making progress to give us films which makes us think about what we say or do everyday

-Peace out guys.","9 April 2022",7,2,4
"Turning Red","I compared Luca with this movie cuz they have the same style but one is so controversial and people didn't like the movie at first glance because of the art style.

I've watched both movies and the two have similar messages. Very close when it comes to originality. But unlike Luca, Turning red can connect audiences more with the character's emotions more. The expressiveness of the characters is also a plus. It was also a roller coaster of emotion, with good timing. There are also many adorable and funny scenes since they portrayed 13 year old girls in that era, along with the culture so well. Keep an open mind folks.

So many ppl are giving this movie a 1 star even without watching the film yet.

P.s. I used to dislike the movie when I first watched the trailer too but this movie totally changed my mind. Better than expected.","12 March 2022",10,5,13
"Turning Red","Pandas, check. Asian moms, check. Weird religions, check. Bamboos, check. Honoring your ancestors, check. Respecting elders, check. Good job playing into all the stereotypes. There was nothing that represented Chinese or Asians in this film.","7 April 2022",1,3,8
"Turning Red","I grew up in China and this story literally reminds me of my own childhood. Also, those jokes on Asian people are hilarious. The only problem is that recent Pixar/Disney movies all strictly follow those conventional structures in storytelling, making the whole story a little bit tedious. After all, you could easily 'predict' what would happen next.","11 March 2022",8,7,21
"Turning Red","A bright, bubbly & breezy delight that's as visually buoyant as it is emotionally resonant, Pixar's Turning Red marks a new shift in the pioneering animation studio's approach to storytelling as it allows its younger artists to take over the reins from the old masters and bring their own voice & personal touch to add to the studio's unparalleled repertoire. Brought to screen with unabashed verve & brimming with strong feminine energy, the film also happens to be their first that's solely directed by a woman & led by an all-female creative team.

Co-written & directed by Domee Shi in her feature directorial effort, the plot concerns a 13-year old girl who turns into a giant red panda whenever she gets too excited. At its core, the premise serves as a metaphor for puberty, with magic & mysticism thrown into the mix to add more zing to its Asian flavour while the young protagonist's journey of self-discovery as she navigates the ups n downs of teenage life makes it universal in its appeal & relatable to everyone. And all of it unfolds with the same old Pixar's creative zest, narrative mastery & first-rate animation.

The ideas & inspirations come from Shi's own upbringing & teenage experience but what makes this story so fun & fascinating is the honesty & openness with which it addresses the topics that haven't had much of a presence on Hollywood screens. Teenage years are a messy & confusing time for everyone and the film acknowledges & illustrates all of these behaviours & feelings with an unapologetic eye while keeping things light-hearted & entertaining throughout. Infusing more freshness to the imagery is the softer tones, rich palette, anime expressiveness and spectacular score & songs.

Overall, Turning Red brims with unbridled imagination, adolescent energy & effervescent quality and ingeniously covers the themes of family, friendship, love, personal transformation & cultural change with sincerity & at times necessary incisiveness. As original as it is enjoyable & timeless, Domee Shi's feature film debut introduces her as a talent of enormous promise & singular voice and is by all means a welcome entry in the studio canon. One of the best films of the year so far and yet another family-friendly triumph for the legendary creative powerhouse, Pixar Animation Studios' latest leaves an indelible pawprint.","11 May 2022",,0,4
"Turning Red","This movie is great and the panda looks great I just want to pet it very badly. This movie deserves more attention than it gets online. I also the main girl she is so hot and I would definitely go out with her.","27 March 2022",10,3,9
"Turning Red","Kinda whacky thoroughly enjoyable story about a 13 year old girl that experiences new things when stressed most likely because the number 4 is evil to a couple cultures; might be a lightly cringy but damn Turning Red is fantastic! I see why the film is nominated in animation section of Golden Globes it is beautiful throughout and very entertaining. Even for an adult possibly cause I have autism I love my inner childhood sometimes movies like this are a blast of fun for any age. The sounds, acting, important lessons to learn and peaceful vibes are all magnificent! A glorious flow of family loveliness worthy of praise.","5 January 2023",8,0,0
"Turning Red","Ok, some decent Chinese mysticism but otherwise meh. The rest could be an episode of Any generic Disney Tween show a la Lizzy McGuire.

Pretty much a miss just like most of Disney's non musical films.","12 March 2022",5,4,8
"Turning Red","The film Turning Red tells about some events in the life of a 13 years old girl named Meilin, who lives with her Asian immigrant parents in Toronto in the year 2002. Every time the little girl gets nervous, she awakens an inner beast in the film. She learns to deal with adolescence problems. What I love most about this film are the subjects it addresses like adolescence, motherhood, mental health, psychological pressure, friendship, important friends and the period. This film brings a very simple and clear view of such issues, so that children, teenagers and adults can have a lighter understanding of things and have a good laugh. A very positive point is the concern that the directors took with the choice of actors' voices and characters. We have a great representation of Asians and blacks, breaking the standards of white characters.

I recommend this movie to parents who don't know how to deal with these issues for their children, for young people like me to have fun and think a little and for the kids to have a lot of fun, because the movie is super colorful and animated.

I loved it and I give it a ten, everyone should see this movie!","12 July 2022",10,2,3
"Turning Red","Turning Red is a puzzle with many pieces. It is both for children (especially in the second half) and adults (in the first half). It combines both the magic of Disney and the genres of comedy, family drama, growing up and a bit of retro nostalgia. And even though the second half is weaker, that first half was brilliant.","28 April 2022",7,0,4
"Turning Red","I just watched it on Release, and it was great!

I liked the part when Mei was going to 4-Town, she switched forms in mid-air to thrust herself upwards to jump over rooftops, and even thrusted herself downwards while skydiving into the concert!","13 March 2022",10,5,16
"Turning Red","I feel weird having to start of this review with a disclaimer, but I'm male, and in 2002 I was 18.

That said, I can almost perfectly remember what life was like for me and others around me at that time, and it perfectly captured a lot of it.

Beyond that, I loved everything about this movie. The pixar X anime type animation, the voice acting, the chinese asian representation, the retro-modern nostalgia for a simpler time. They managed to capture little details that really spoke to the time period they were representing.

The only bit I feel was lost in was the tension between the mom and the grandma. While they attempted to spell it out, it still did not feel like they fully represented the tension that was shown. Otherwise this was a great movie.

I do feel that the mature-ish themes will make the movie awkwardish to watch with some, and will hard to grasp for young teens the movie was trying to represent. But I think it would be a great film for children and adult who can remember what it was like when they were 13, or who was around to see the world in 2002.

Def an enjoyable film I'm hope to see more of in the future.","15 March 2022",10,3,15
"Turning Red","This is an instant classic. There's so much well done here - girls coming of age in the early 2000s, Asian immigrant family experiences, satire of boy bands. Plus mystical plot devices that follow Chekhov's rule.

It's not just for girls either. While there are some menstruation jokes it will go over younger kids heads and it really is a whole family movie.","21 March 2022",10,4,8
"Turning Red","I like this movie. Tells a story about a four girls in that one girl has a curse of emotion which she turns into a red panda. I like this movie in unique ways like songs, story telling and animation. Telling about animation it was colourful. And this movie is watchable with family..","24 March 2022",6,1,6
"Turning Red","The whole family enjoyed this movie. My daugther said that people were complaining online about the animation style, but I couldn't see anything wrong with it. It is a normal Pixar movie and the story was good enough for adults to sit through it.","21 March 2022",8,1,3
"Turning Red","This film went headfirst into a lot of concepts from the perspective of a thirteen year old girl showing how they may been feeling in different circumstances. It also heavily explores overbearing helicopter parenting and the need for approval it creates. I watched this movie with a few friends and some of them struggled to watched some parts of this movie because of how much it reminded them of their own childhood, sufficed to say the same people were overwhelmed by happiness and were in tears by the end of the film. I feel like this movie can really help people who have parents like the mother in the movie.","17 March 2022",10,5,12
"Turning Red","I genuinely never write reviews but dear god I had to because the people who are genuinely flipping out!!! Because of a COMING OF AGE MOVIE!! ABOUT GIRLS!! ... WHO HAPPEN TO BE GOING THROUGH PUBERTY!! A literal time of when girls body's go through a cornucopia of changes (i.e. Physical, emotional, psychological, etc.). No experience is the same but I can tell you this: this movie made something extremely scary and sometimes lonely, normal. It made every change make sense and could show kids out there that it's okay and not to be scared. I remember hitting puberty as a young girl and absolutely terrified because media always taught me to be ashamed and that what I was going through and doing was frowned upon.

Grow up. If you sexualise these characters then there's something wrong with YOU. This movie is about growth and about an adolescent who is trying to find themselves in the world and their environment. Look up something by the name of Erikson's Eight Stages of Development. Adolescents go through something called Identity vs. Confusion. This is where they test the boundaries of their environment and themselves and come to terms with understanding their morals, and try to develop a sense of self. The rebellion and the push back in the movie is of this character trying to understand who they are away from their family. It's normal and it's biological. And it's been scientifically theorised.

All in all, this movie is wonderful. Watch it and enjoy it. Whether you were a teen in the 60s and going through beatlemania, the 80s and 90s and experiencing hip hop and pop boy bands, or now. We all remember what it felt like to get butterflies and nervous about a crush or wanting to be your own person as a teenager.","14 March 2022",10,3,6
"Turning Red","You don't have to be a 13 year old to enjoy this movie, you just have to take it for what it is, a coming of age story. And of course its a little bit cringe or awkward at times, but these are teenagers we're talking about, its in their nature, and this movie portrays them authentically. Most people that dislike this movie apparently can't stand teenagers, and don't have the self reflecting skills to realize that we all went through that stage in life.

In this movie Mei goes through the experience of finding her true self, and that is relatable regardless of your gender, culture and upbringing. I sincerely don't understand the hate, people keep complaining they just cant relate to the characters, but once again we were all teenagers at one point, and we were awful as well, but that's part of life, and pretending its not is just lying.

Sure, you might not be a 13 year old right now, but the story is still universal if you give it a chance and empathize with the characters, which at the end of the day are faithful representations of what its like to be human (and apparently a red panda from once in a while).

Great fun, with dynamic characters that stay true to themselves, with the right mindset this movie is a blast. 9/10.","15 May 2022",9,1,3
"Turning Red","Fun, entretaining. With a good mesage about puberty that maybe girls and wemen can ralate better than me. The art style is fun and dinamic. As I daid there is a message in the entire movie, but is really obvious, not much room for interpretation, but maybe thats the way it's suppose to be for kids to get it (but never as bad as in The Platform 2019)","27 March 2022",8,1,5
"Turning Red","If you can relate to experiences involving sudden strong emotions that you previously never had to deal with, crushing on boys thinking they're your soulmate, the pressure of being caught between the culture you were born in and a culture you're growing up in, or parents you love and respect but also feel suffocated by at times I definitely recommend giving this a watch. I've seen a lot of comments calling it inappropriate and that it's going to ""put ideas in your kid's head"" but I imagine it's because they're a similar ""helicopter parent who's overly strict and forgot what it feels like to be 13"" type of parent. If you find talk of menstruation, girls obsessing over boys, being ""rebellious"", a girl wanting some slack and to be allowed to be a kid or, you know, a 13 yo girl acting like a 13 yo girl, inappropriate then this movie probably isn't for you (or any Disney movie with a young girl as the lead since every Disney princess rebelled against their parent(s)).","23 March 2022",8,3,8
"Turning Red","The Red Panda that ensouls a little girl due to the connection of her ancestors starts to frighten her & she questions her identity. Finally, when she came to know the biggest secret of her family, the biggest lesson of her life is delivered. Acceptance. No power is good or bad. It is our control over it that defines our fate. This message is given in a nice way. Must watch for all kids!","18 March 2022",7,2,7
"Turning Red","When I read about Turning Red I knew it was going to be something special. As I do not have Disney Plus, I had to accept it would be a little while before I got around to watching this, and because it was on sale on Amazon Prime I picked it up.

After watching it, I was extremely pleased that it matched my expectations. Having the film set in early 2000's, there was a fair amount of 90's nostalgia, touch tone phones, tamagotchi, and the international obsession with 90's style boy bands.

What really makes this such a great film though is the focus on Asian diaspora. The details all ring very true, if you ever had friends or family with an east Asian background, you've met parents like Mei's parents, met aunties just like Mei's aunties, so much about the characters has a verisimilitude to which anyone can relate. And Mei and her group of friends, if you you went to school in North America, it's almost a foregone conclusion you've met (or been in) a friend group just like them. Everything about the setting and the story is incredibly relatable, and the core themes of coming of age, balancing the hopes and expectations of family with the hopes and dreams of the individual are incredibly well done.","4 July 2022",9,1,3
"Turning Red","Predictable, cliche, cringeworthy, boring, repetitive, derivative....the description could go on but you get the point.

Pixar has been on a huge downward spiral since Coco, which was a beautiful masterpiece.

Soul came close to capturing the magic BUT felt the need to use their only black male lead character turn into something else for 80% if the film.

This film however was truly unbearable. So incredibly lazy and forced.

Pixar is done.","27 March 2022",3,4,10
"Turning Red","This type of movies encourages the young generation to disobey their parents and it contains some of the sensitive scenes that should not be revealed this way.","15 March 2022",1,11,30
"Turning Red","Been a while since I been so moved by a animated film . Loved the art , the details . Little things like chewing gum under the bench and so on . Great film about family , friends , growing up and finding yourself.

PIXAR has outdone itself.","14 March 2022",9,2,7
"Turning Red","I'll give Pixar credit for taking on a challenging subject like puberty. Of course, they also played it safe by making it modern enough that there are computers and cell phones, but not so modern that social media is a big issue. Oh, to long for that early 2000s nostalgia. While I couldn't relate to the gender issues presented in this movie, I definitely experienced late puberty around the film's timeframe. And perhaps that's why I found Turning Red (2021) so funny: they nailed a lot of the popular cultural elements.

Also, as a guy, I actually found a lot of the ""period humor"" to be hilarious as well. Perhaps because it's somewhat embarrassing, but also a totally natural part of growing up, these jokes had me laughing out loud. Or, maybe my humor is just a bizarre combination of memes and puns. Probably the latter (gotta love all the multiple meanings of ""Turning Red""). Still, this movie is a good jumping-off point for talking to my children about these changes that will eventually happen. Anything to aid in these inevitable conversations is a welcome addition in my book.

Visually, it is interesting to see a CGI movie like this use a style that's grounded in a more 2-dimensional aesthetic. The CalArts ""jellybean mouth"" style of animation has been around for many years (with a notable example being Adventure Time), but its cartoony look clashes a little with the extremely realistic settings that Pixar can produce. Plot-wise, Turning Red is a bit simple, relying on Asian parent and child stereotypes just enough to get the point across. Ultimately, Turning Red has a lot going for it, but other movies have also done this kind of ""coming of age"" bit as well.

Some funny early 2000s nostalgia fused with a potentially taboo subject, I give Turning Red 3.5 stars out of 5.","12 July 2022",7,0,2
"Turning Red","This movie was both super fun to watch and so relatable as an Asian trying to balance their lives between their culture of origin and culture of residence. The generational trauma is very real and I deal with it every day.","21 May 2022",10,2,5
"Turning Red","This is a terrible, stereotypical ripoff of some Gravity Falls episode I like. This movie is cashgrabbing, unfunny, and really weird. I'm sick N tired of Disney winning the Oscars nonstop.","11 June 2022",2,2,11
"Turning Red","I love when Disney and Pixar create unique, creative and touching original films about sensitive topics! Definitely one of the better Pixar films in recent times ! Love all the feels of this film!","12 March 2022",10,4,25
"Turning Red","I don't really get the hate for this one. It's not the usual Pixar, and had bold themes, but they handled them very well! The animation was beautiful, and the colour palette was gorgeous. The astral world was amazing. Characters were funny, relatable, and it has a wholesome happy ending. Overall, a perfect lighthearted watch!","25 August 2022",7,1,3

Genre: Animated/Family
My Score: 7.2

Cast=5 Acting=7 Plot=6 Ending=9 Story=7
Art=9 Voice=8 Music=6 Family=8 Funny=7

A 13 year old girl is starting to feel changes in her body...when she gets excited, she changes into a giant red panda. Something that her overprotective mother was painfully aware would happen.

""We've all got an inner beast. We've all got a messy, loud, weird part of ourselves hidden away."" This obvious euphemism turned out to be a cute little story and a boy band with the worst song ever made. This is a must see for pre-teens and a pretty good family movie all around. This movie was very up on inclusion...right down to the diabetic bracelet on one of the characters. All in all, a solid Disney movie.","12 April 2022",7,0,3
"Turning Red","Not for young/innocent kids. This is a movie thats made to look like its for your little ones but its not. The comments and subjects are questionable even for young teens. Sad to think you cant just turn on a Pixar/Disney movie for your kids without having to preview it first.","25 March 2022",1,10,30
"Turning Red","The film shows the negative effects of tiger parenting in a colorful way while showing a girl's coming of age story, definitely a good movie to watch.","15 March 2022",7,2,9
"Turning Red","I watched this movie with my wife and as we watched we mostly realized this movie was not made for us. Unlike some other Pixar movies this film has a much more direct audience they are targeting and that audience is children. For. The acting and animation style make it is pretty clear who it's intended for. That being said we did still enjoy it. Colors and style are bright and wild and it should keep your attention on the film tho I personally started to get a bit board towards the end. I'm giving this a higher rating then I normally would because I can just tell this was not made for me so my ratting might be off for what it was intended for.","13 March 2022",7,1,7
"Turning Red","What a lovely mixed up of westernized imaginery from east. True, its not what we use to see and defenitely its a movie with a lot of real young culture . If your above 30 just let it in - there is a lot love in this movie and precisely, to see whats beautiful in it you'll have to accept what the story is telling about acepting life changes and embracing what it may not be so cute.","14 March 2022",9,2,8
"Turning Red","This movie was so cute and as someone who was 13/14 around the same time period it was pretty relatable.

All the parents getting mad that it's ""not a family movie"" because it talks about menstruation and kids disobeying their parents clearly don't remember being 13.

I wish there were more movies like this when I was younger!","25 March 2022",9,3,7
"Turning Red","Turning Red flows effortlessly as it displays a story transitioning into womanhood in a very family-friendly way. Mei's story is a perfect analogy about going through puberty, navigating the feelings that come with that change, and finding oneself countering family ideals.

""We all got a hidden beast""
I perceive this as we all have strong emotions. We all go through changes, so this story is relatable. I can only imagine how relatable this is for young women. The main protagonist undergoes an emotional transition as she develops her body changes ( turning into a red panda) due to a family blessing/ curse. Mei detaches herself from her mother's overbearing embarrassment lashes out in an attempt to understand herself. She was furthering the portrayal as a typical teenage girl transitioning into womanhood.

""Weird, messy part of us hidden away""

I enjoyed the character design. I'm interested in knowing the importance of the film in the early 2000s. The flip phones, the slang, the colors, the emphasis on the boy band hype all add to the setting appeal. I thought that was a nice touch.

Verdict: Turning Red serves as an informative and enjoyable analogy film about life changes. You cannot go wrong with a Pixar film. Watch this with your kids, especially those pre-teens, as they go through changes!","14 March 2022",8,1,10
"Turning Red","Could rate this a 10 or an 8. 9 is in the middle, so chose that.

Surprisingly good stories. A story that had many levels and was not predictable.

I wanted to say that I'm not sure if this movie works for kids. But I saw Sonic the Hedgehog with my 8 and 5 year old nephews, and they liked that movie. This movie works for adults and youngins.","9 April 2022",9,1,4
"Turning Red","It wasn't the worst movie ever, I just didn't love it. Didn't enjoy the art style, and the characters were super overreacting and awkward to watch. They just didn't behave like real people. It was an interesting metaphor idea but just a bit off I guess. On the plus side, the 4*town songs were hilarious, and the idea for the story was neat, again though, the characters were just too ridiculous. I felt that the mother and daughter were incredibly rude and apathetic to each other, and didn't even attempt to be mature and talk anything out without screaming alot. The drug store scene is very hard to watch.","6 November 2022",6,1,2
"Turning Red","Just to make sure if it's safe enough for your kids based on your own preference, screen the movie.

Turning Red can either be on each side of the spectrum. It can be relatable, thus people like it, or uncomfortable, thus people hate it.

For me, however, The movie's highly relatable, heck I'm not even a 2000s kid, nor am I a fanboy of any boy band of sorts; but the movie reflected what my class, my community, and what my school was.

The cringe, the weird and unfunny humor, the weird movements, the peony talk. They are all intentional in my opinion because of how they were an integral part of everyone~ er, a lot of people's teenage experiences. I was thirteen four years ago, and I can happily relate to the shame and the popularity Mei was getting because she was different. I was Mei, in a different way. Some parents cannot accept that this movie could be a reflection of their child right now, which is understandable looking at how uncomfortable this movie can get for other people. If all of those properties are unintentional however, it's fortunately neutralized because this is what a teen is. That is what I was.

I could be as bold to say that this is a nice step up for Pixar. If they got twitter mad because of this, it basically means they succeeded. A lot of parents can say that it's as bold as disrespecting your parents' desires just because you want to be you, but if it's a message that normalizes a kid coming out of their shell to talk and behave like what they actually are (as long as it's socially acceptable, that is), I'm in.

In a nutshell, this is the epitome of a lot of people's teenage years; or their peers' teenage years that they experienced in this point of view. Thus, I like it.

Pixar never failed to entertained me. Thanks for the nostalgia.","13 March 2022",10,3,9

"Turning Red","Turning red is an interesting animation and it's funny and worths watching for once but it doesn't have the standards that i expected from pixar. They have been going down hill for a while.","28 March 2022",7,1,3
"Turning Red","Liked: It was funny. Lots of Canada references. Great film for families.

Loved: Third act. That's all I'm going to say. Wasn't expecting that! The father in the film.

Didn't like: Slight pacing issues. Music score. Felt like it was missing something.

Not Pixar's best but definitely not the train wreck some reviewers make it out to be. Didn't really feel like a Pixar movie. Felt like a Disney movie. Something was definitely missing but still I would've liked to see this on the big screen. Disney taking it off their schedule is a weird move because it kind of seemed like it would've been a hit seeing how this would've resonated with many that went to middle school. Opportunity missed I guess.

Post credit scene? Yes. Didn't add to the story but it was fun to see.","12 March 2022",6,1,4
"Turning Red","Don't get me wrong, I agree with the movie's message and everything (as you'll see, the majority of one-star reviews are right-wing conservative nut-jobs) but I just got bored about 20 minutes in and basically predicted the entire story from the start. The animation is cute, and I'm glad we're getting more realistic and uncensored portrayals of middle schoolers, but this just doesn't do it for me.

Also, almost everything the mom does is completely far-fetched and over the top. I get what they were going for but seriously, they could've been just a little more subtle.","13 March 2022",5,4,13
"Turning Red","I decided to watch the movie not only because it was new and quickly available but because of the extreme reviews i was seeing. I noted that many parents did not approve or like the movie because of the message of 'disobedience' that they saw. But also noted that kids, teenagers, and young adults loved the movie and the message of individualism and choosing what's right for yourself. I think if you don't like the message it gives, there's some work within yourself you might need to work on. Personally, i loved the movie and will be rewatching it until i'm sick of it (doubtful). 10/10 reccomend!!","14 March 2022",10,4,14
"Turning Red","This is a movie to watch with your younger kids as it's about growing up.

HOWEVER - the movie should have a WARNING! After watching it with my kids I had some EXTREMELY UNCOMFORTABLE discussions about boy groups from the late 90s! For days we had to listen to the back street boys, o-town, nsync and all the others... now they know what I used to listen to when I was younger. I was not prepared to have this talk. I thought there was still time.","30 March 2022",9,2,4
"Turning Red","This is an absolutely adorable, embarrassingly real story. I remember being a preteen girl once, and this is (at times painfully) true to the preteen girl experience. I giggled through the entire opening 20 mins, but by the end I was sobbing. Look guys. If you hate the movie because ""it glorifies finding yourself and disobeying parents"" you must just hate all Disney movies! And you're probably an overcontrolling parent that thinks you're owed every thought in your child's head and will subsequently give them parental issues for LIFE. Take a hint, will you?","14 March 2022",8,2,9
"Turning Red","My 15 and 18 year old couldn't wait to see this movie, so we sat down as a family to watch it. I'm going to be honest, I really wasn't expecting much.. but man, I am so happy to say, I was SO WRONG!! We LOVED it!! We could all relate to 13 year old MaiMai. We belly laughed at her antics, felt stressed at her anxiety and cried when she was emotional.. it's a beautiful coming of age journey that felt so personal to each of us. Thanks Pixar / Disney for making a movie that we could all be part of.","12 March 2022",10,4,10
"Turning Red","""Turning Red: is a great tribute to the city of Toronto and its Chinese population. The film follows the life of a teenage girl of Chinese descent going through puberty and discovering that the women in the family have a secret and it's her turn to face it. The animation is perfect and brings fun and entertainment to the whole family. Although it can't compare to recent Pixar movies like ""Soul"", ""Up"" or ""Coco"", ""Turning Red"" is a celebration of an adolescent's life turning into a woman and at the same time fighting against the family tradition and its preconceived ideas.","31 March 2022",7,0,5
"Turning Red","Turning Red (2022)

3/4

""Turning Red"" was released earlier this year, and has since received some mixed reception. I've even heard some people call it ""the worst Pixar movie that they've made"" and some have called it a masterpiece. I admit to really liking the film. I enjoyed a lot of it, and admired a lot of it too. The visual style is massively vibrant, colorful and eye popping, which is my main reason, I think, of enjoying it as much as I did.

Set in Toronto, 2002, ""Turning Red"" follows 13 year old Mei, an ambitious and successful Chinese girl who is going through a period in her life like any girl does. But it all changes for her when she turns into a big red panda, which turns out to be something that she's inherited from her family, a characteristic that has carried down from generation to generation. Mei must learn to live with the panda, and deal with her own family and personal problems.

Mainly, the story is interesting, but the style is very much like anime. It's well done and thoroughly crafted, with a wonderful and compelling style. It was directed by Domee Shi, who made the absolutely brilliant ""Bao"" six years earlier. The drawing and directing style are very similar.

Overall, I enjoyed it much more than I expected, and thought it was a very well made Pixar film. It's not their best film, but it really is wonderful - a cultural representation of anime and different cultures, made into an enjoyable adolescent fairy tale.","24 September 2022",8,0,1
"Turning Red","It is not for children at all!!

My kids didnt understand it ..
even the teenagers itsnt good for them ..
it teaches them disobedience and rebellion the parents.

It isn't good for girl on 13 years old.","13 March 2022",2,8,22
"Turning Red","I kind of had high hopes for this movie. But, when I watched it I was disappointed... First let's start with the characters. Mei's friends are irritating asf the worst one is Miriam (a bítch) and Abby I just wanted to punch ger in the face!!!!!! Piriam is just... i hate her too. The mom can be funny at times but still... the dad is irritating he doesn't add ANYTHING to the story.","2 April 2022",4,2,8
"Turning Red","Finally a Pixar movie I actively disliked. Not even Cars 2 was this bad. It was a chore to get through this movie as I was always turning red with rage at the screen. I, actually, liked the style and the animation is flawless, as always, but it all comes down to the writing, and we have to suffer through the most obnoxious girl ever, along with the worst mother of all time, acting like insane people for most of the movie just for the sake of comedy or to create conflict. Long gone is the care that Pixar used to give to all of their screenplays, here it's all very cliched, all very predictable and every message is as subtle as a sledgehammer. Definitely not recommended!","20 January 2023",4,0,0
"Turning Red","I watched the movie with my 2 boys and we all found it endearing, hilarious and had a blast watching it. Saw it twice in 1 week. Finally an experience hitting on growing up as Asian American girl in a positive light with a strong and confident character. Loved the good-natured parody on the early 2000's boy band craze - with music done by Billie Eilish/ Finneus no less. The movie supports being an individual and valuing friendships and family. While the theme hit in puberty, to my little kids it was more just a funny coming of age story with an ancestral theme (they had no idea any reference to puberty) and both boys loved the movie.","21 March 2022",10,2,4
"Turning Red","Man, I heard there was a lot of controversy over this movie, and I just don't get it. I thought it was hilarious, and really entertaining. Me and my husband were both cracking up the whole way through it. The teen girl cringe humour is solid in this one, and after the movie I sat there reminiscing about all the dumb things me and my friends did as tween girls and having a laugh at that. The voice acting was good, and I just enjoyed the design of it all as well. I'd happily watch it again.","1 April 2022",8,1,5
"Turning Red","Put this film on for my 3 year old son. Caught my interest and couldn't stop watching.

"Turning Red","We watched this movie when it arrived in Spring 2022 on Disney+, and recently my daughter re-watched on the plane. Despite the title, the emphasis on girls puberty is fairly restrained, at least explicitly; other themes such as the experience of Chinese-Canadian families, and a particularly Canadian style of multiculturalism, are much more prominent. But the Red Panda-identity steals the show, especially for my son, who enjoyed pointing out that the rendering was very inaccurate: basically, it looks like Po the Kung Fu Panda but with red fur instead of black fur. And sized like Po as well. Come on, Pixar, you can do better! Probably the favorite aspect of the plot for both kiddos was the drama surrounding the boy band, ""Five Town"" (there are only four of them), which will go down as one of the best in the annals of boy band satire.","2 January 2023",9,0,0
"Turning Red","Steeped in Canadiana, this sweet, energetic, & relatable Pixar fantasy serves up a tasty dish of family fun while exploring complex issues related to the anxiety of puberty & its affect on relationships with family & friends. #nitrosMovieChallenge.","11 April 2022",8,0,1
"Turning Red","Since watching the trailer, I had huge expectations on the movie & now, after watching this, I am happy that it turned out very good. I liked the new graphic, dramatic taking few scenes, which I think is pixer's new thing. Liked the cute panda character, kudos to the designers. Quoting 'Lego movie' I would say everything is awsome!","13 May 2022",8,1,4
"Turning Red","There is no doubt that each Pixar premiere generates great expectations for us every year. The animation studio returns to give us an original film with a truly wonderful result.

The Oscar winner Domee Shi is in charge of bringing us this new bet from Pixar and the pure heart that the director gives to a very personal story is clearly noticeable.

An adventure worth every second of her attention.

How about this version of Domee Shi?

The great merit of Turning Red is to return to the purest essence of the studio. Feeling again that we are entering a world of children, but with adult themes is what makes the studio great. Once again we find that innocence in this beautiful adventure about growing up and searching for your own identity.

An adventure that the director manages almost like a personal story with that allows the story to captivate with that purity of seeing moments of life reflected on screen. Especially those moments when women begin to experience real hormonal or physical changes (wonderful moment of the first menstruation between mother and daughter)

Pixar and its director once again deliver an entertaining adventure from start to finish with no stops to slow down. A story that maintains a constant adrenaline and innocence that keeps you connected at all times with Meiling.

A complete work of voices

If there is something I always like about Pixar, it is that they know how to choose their voice cast very well. Once again, she achieves the task in that aspect, both Rosalie Chiang and Sandra Oh shine with their voices, giving life to two characters that take over the screen thanks to the charisma that both actresses deliver. Similarly, the rest of the cast is as successful as ever.

Final score

It might be Pixar's best animated movie this year, but with the studio you never know why it always manages to wow you the most considering it's its first release of the year. What is clear is that Turning Red is one of the best films of the studio, not because of its spectacular nature, but because of its purity when it comes to giving us an adventure full of personal milestones and special moments that mark the lives of many.

You may like this movie more or less, but it will not leave you indifferent. We have all at some point been Mailing facing our adolescence.

What is clear is that we all have an inner beast and that to a greater or lesser extent we learn to live with it.","12 March 2022",8,1,8
"Turning Red","Pixar returns with another movie that is, unfortunately, going straight to Disney+ with little recognition or fanfare about it. Pixar movies were usually the animated movies that everyone was talking about but I barely heard anyone talk about this one. The premise is ""Mei Lee is a 13-year-old girl who is torn between being her mother's obedient daughter and the chaos of her youth. As if that were not enough, when she gets too excited, she turns into a big red panda"". Is this a sleeper hit or is this going to be a Pixar movie people forget?

Let's get the obvious out of the way first. This movie is visually great with its phenomenal animation. The character designs, the city and the panda itself are all wonderfully pleasant. There is a lot of anime-inspired influences within the film and it certainly shows in the visuals. It's a mostly grounded movie but when the magical stuff happens, the usual Pixar magic occurs and it is great! For example, there is a nightmare sequence and it is just ridiculously weird, which I love. The cinematography is great as usual with some stellar shots. Ludwig Göransson who is the music composer for Black Panther, Tenet and The Mandalorian is composing for Turning Red (2022). He does a good job with his utilization of Chinese wind instruments, which helps capture the feel of the film. There is also a music segment that combines Cantonese chants with a pop song and Ludwig is somehow able to make that work!

Turning Red is a coming of age story which has been overdone and it is also obvious from the first 10 minutes what the message at the end is going to be. Yet despite that, I came out enjoying the story and being completely satisfied by where the characters end up. The main character, Mei, and her relationship with her mother is the heart of the film. It's a good focus as I found their love for each other very heart-warming. Thus, when there is a conflict between them, it is genuinely quite sad to see which shows how effective the movie was. Likewise, the friendship between Mei and her friends is also very touching. It's also the first Pixar film to focus on Asian culture which I appreciate. There isn't a lot of western films that focus on Asian culture so it was nice that Pixar was willing to do so. It does have a lot of Asian culture in it but I don't think it ever gets to the point that it isolates non-Asian's enjoyment of it.

However, one big gripe I have about this film is its very cringy humour. Instead of having the humour done naturally or in a smart way, they go for this weirdly silly humour and I never found it funny. For example, there is a moment where someone twerks their butt in someone's face and I just found it incredibly stupid. I'm also a bit mixed on the voice performance of Mei the main character. While the actress, Rosalie Chiang, can effectively portray a 13-year-old, probably because the actress is around that age, the tone of her voice is almost the same in every scene. It's noticeable because every other major voice actor and actress have more oomph in their voice work compared to her. That is just me being overly picky though but for Rosalie's first proper acting role, I think she does a good job.

My next point is a very controversial one but I think this is a niche film because of its targeted audience. The reason is having the main characters be 13-year-old girls obsessed with boy bands. The first 10 minutes of the movie is very off-putting because of the hyperactive nature of the main lead Mei. I found it difficult to connect with the main character because of these reasons. The fact that the main focus is Mei wanting to watch and daydream about the boys in this band is just hard to sympathize with. The film is also a metaphor for puberty with a blatant line about tampons being associated with Mei turning to a Panda. The director has clearly stated that the title ""Turning Red"" is an allegory for a young woman's life. This element of sexual repression being in a family movie/ Pixar movie is just weird and will alienate a majority of the audience.

Overall, I am glad that Pixar tried to do something unique. It has a heart-warming family story in it that is unfortunately squandered by how the main character is written. It's great that Asians are getting more representation in western movies but I don't think this was the exact right approach. It is still an enjoyable coming of age story and I think the good elements outweigh the weird negatives of Turning Red.","12 March 2022",7,0,11

"Turning Red","I give 7.3/10 for a nice ordinary story but minimal effects.

The story is nothing bad and nothing special but average nice smooth cartoon.

Only recommended watch at home with minimal kids cartoon paid entertainment.","14 July 2022",7,0,2
"Turning Red","Predictable but engaging. Not as creative or emotional as Pixar can be but unique animation with truly gorgeous shots. It's funny & a good metaphor for girls growing up. The Asian aesthetic & representation is awesome.","25 May 2022",7,0,3
"Turning Red","Turning Red stars, Rosalie Chang, Sandra Oh, Ava Morse and many more, this film tells the story of a 13 year old girl that is going through some changes such as turning into a red panda.

I'll begin with this because I feel it's important. If you are reading this review as a parent who thought they might watch this with their kid I would suggest you really listen to what I am going to say before watching Turning Red.

To me this film has a very specific audience and unfortunately that audience does not consist of kids who are under 12 years old. The movie follows a 13 year old girl who is dealing with certain changes in her life such as turning into a red panda. This obviously is a metaphor for puberty, which is completely ok if it didn't have the Pixar named attached to it.

Pixar is known for making movies that appeal to everyone, their movies have themes that both young kids can learn from and adults can relate to. If your kid watches this movie the core theme of this film will go over their head, but their are certain aspects that I wouldn't consider appropriate for a younger audience. They make a lot of references to girls periods, their hormones, crushes, and just regular feelings that middle school girls have when going through puberty. They reference these things in a way that in my opinion isn't appropriate for kids under 12. In addition to that there is a play on words that I feel is in really poor taste and if you do watch this film I think you'll know what I mean.

On a technical level this film is flawless. The animation is extremely creative and there was a lot of inspiration pulled from anime when doing the facial expressions and other elements of the animation. The voice actors are across the board great, everyone gives expressive vocal performances that are fun to watch. The flow of the story is great and makes sense. But all that being said there are just far too many elements within the film that I don't believe should be shown to young kids.

If you are the parent of a kid who is entering this middle school life and will be dealing with these themes by all means show this to them and enjoy. But if you are a parent of a younger kid if I were I'd just watch Encanto again.

Although technically flawless Turning Red has far too many strange elements that don't seem suited for the audience that Pixar films usually have. With amazing vibrant animation and quality voice acting if shown to the right age group this movie will be enjoyable.

7.5/10.","1 April 2022",7,0,5
"Turning Red","Ugh it was painful. I ended up watching the second half by myself, because my all stop watching it, even my 13 year old daughter who should have been the target audience. Pixar hasn't been the same for a long while.","2 April 2022",3,2,5
"Turning Red","Weird show, cant say much more. Inside Out was a fun show about emotions and growing up. Inside Out was a million times better, it was relatable, enjoyable and memorable. This will go the way of The Good Dinosaur and easily forgotten.","14 March 2022",1,9,26
"Turning Red","This movie was fun to watch. The animation was entertaining. The story was engaging in the moment. However for all of its good points, this movie is very forgettable. I have little desire to watch it again.","16 March 2022",5,1,5
"Turning Red","As someone who is near the intended age range, I can say that I didn't relate, but I did thoroughly enjoy this movie regardless. It was a really fun and cute ride and the story was heartwarming in a way I wasn't expecting. I love all of the life they put into this movie. The only criticisms I have are that it pretty cringy, but I expected that and wasn't super upset about it because after a bit it just added to the charm. I also was kinda bored when it came to the old 3rd act break-up. Besides that I did really enjoy this movie.","5 May 2022",8,1,3
"Turning Red","Very funny and beautiful movie, characters and screenplay very professional and beautiful, this history very much like all my friends and family! Thanks for very good mood.","25 August 2022",10,1,3
"Turning Red","What a great animation Pixar made. The storyline is not new and often told, but something is new anyway. Turning red is a nice metaphor for THE turning point in a girl's life and it was animated and written so nicely. Love it.","19 March 2022",9,2,9
"Turning Red","This movie was enjoyable and relatable from start to finish to me as a young adult. This is definitely a movie you would watch as a child and watch again in deeper appreciation in the deep topics covered in the movie. If you grew up with a strict parent, denied yourself in order to please them, are a woman who had a mom, and like a hint of psychology then you'll love this movie.","7 July 2022",10,2,5
"Turning Red","This movie is a cliche, cringy mess, that covers no new bases since brave (mother daughter conflict, daughter learns to find her own way and come to terms with mothers expectations, one or both transforms into giant bear).","7 June 2022",1,3,8

"Turning Red","Honestly turning red was a really fun ride, it could have been better if meilin lee wasnt a 4 town stan. Instead she could have achieved her dreams or smth.","7 April 2022",8,1,2
"Turning Red","Meilin (Rosalie Chiang) is a 13-year-old girl with ambition, 3 great friends, and a powerful ability to shapeshift into a large red panda! Together, they will exploit her unique gift, so Mei-mei, Miriam (Ava Morse), Abby (Hyein Park), and Priya (Maitreyi Ramakrishnan) can raise enough money to go to a concert of the most popular boy band around, 4*Town! What Mei-mei doesn't count on is her mom, Ming (Sandra Oh) stopping her from 'Turning Red'.

Fairly boilerplate girl-power Disney/Pixar film; overbearing parents, strong religious and/or familial ties, bullheaded desire for something, breaking point, happy ending. Don't expect anything super unique or nuanced about the formula here - if it ain't broke, don't fix it.

That being said, the film is cute. Each of Meilin's friends is an archetypical teenage girl; one is gothy and monotone, one is grounded and chill, and the other is short and wildly energetic. It's fun in a way a typical Disney film should be, but nothing more. A few references to Disney's acquired IP's (like the Simpsons) make their way in the film too.

Worth a once over, maybe with the kids.","6 June 2022",7,0,3
"Turning Red","I think this movie had a good start, but it got simpler and simpler with the way it evolved. It felt like the production came up with an interesting idea with the inner story, but messed up with the outer story. I really missed some depth and seriousness, and it could remind me of a low-budget Disney Channel show sometimes. This type of story has been used in other movies, but I liked the way the Chinese culture got presented. It's nice to experience something different. I noticed that the movie has an anime-inspired animation, and it worked quite well, and in addition, the animation and its details were insane. Otherwise, I recommend this movie for all children, but generally, only as a popcorn movie.","19 June 2022",6,0,3
"Turning Red","The movie shows a Canadian's perspective of a Chinese stereotype out of imagination. The red panda anime is cute. The 13-year-old is energetic and growing to a woman. However, the story about the Chinese mom-daughter relationship is such a cliché out of the director & scriptwriter's stereotyped thinking.","14 March 2022",3,5,12
"Turning Red","Pixar keeps creating new and original stories for the public with new directors. In this case Domee Shi tells her tale about growing up in Toronto, but with a special twist, where her character turns into a red panda. I must say, that the concept of explaining puberty in this unique way is really interesting. In fact, I'm pretty sure lot's of young girls would want to have the same ability as Mei Lee. Even some older audience like me wouldn't mind having this, like I'd love to turn into an animal sometimes when I get emotional, but I know that this story is mostly fictional, since it's animated. However, let's move on how the idea was executed.

13 year old girl Meilin Lee is a straight A+ student, who also has cool friends Miriam, Priya and Abby. And all of them are obsessed with a music group 4town! However, since Mei needs to be the perfect daughter for her mom to keep her happy! But one night, Mei has a bad dream and she got so emotional, that she turned herself into a huge red panda. And if any strong emotion happens, the transformation will occure.

And later on the movie juggles between two plots, one about mother daughter relationship, and the other one about getting tickets to the concert while using new Mei's powers! What's upsetting is that we only see how Mei develops and later accepts her personality. I kinda wish they explored more on her relationships with her supportive father and her friends. Since both were mostly left undeveloped. In fact, I enjoyed a scene where her dad finds some silly recordings her friends made, and tells her that she shouldn't be ashamed of who she truly is. I kinda wish these two had more scenes together. That and exploring the other girls more. Because they feel rather like stereotypes, like Miriam is the free spirited tomboy, Priya is the emo Twilight obsessed one and Abby is literally just human version of sugar and coffee, where she's just hyperactive! The plots themselves sound good for something like a video game, in fact, if it had a tie in game like in 2000s (which is where thw movie set), I would love to play it. The final battle especially reminded me of the Ratatouille game. And it was just weird and crazy, yet could work well in a game. But, I'm going to judge a movie, as a movie.

And I honestly hated Ming. I know she's meant to be the overprotective mom, but she just went too far. In one scene, Mei was just doodling herself with a guy from the store, but Ming thought that he was actually doing stuff to her and even sued him in front of her daughter. Her behavior is so strict, that it makes Karen look like a rebel by comparison. And Mei herself is probably the best element in the story. In fact, she reminded me of myself. Yes, I was very emotional and still am sometimes. Yes, I fantasized about one actor and drew silly doodles. But, I think that most people went through this phase where they act the same way. Also, I like her motive of going to the concert, no matter what. Even she has to break some rules to achieve her goals. And she ain't perfect, thus making her more relatable to preteens, specifically girls. She may be clumsy and overreacting, but that makes her normal, since not everyone can keep their scores perfect all the time. The relationship honestly reminded me of Merida's and Elinor's, where one of them turned into an animal, and at the beginning have a shakey relationship, but at the end accept each other's mistakes. Finally, Tyler was a bully who made fun of our protagonist and called her momma's girl, that is, until he decided to use her new panda form for advantage, by using her as a birthday item. And I'm glad he didn't turn into a love interest by the end, that would've been so cliche.

The soundtrack was good like always. Especially the 4town theme song which sounds like it was recorded straight from 2000s. Surprisingly, Billie Eilish wrote it, who is usually known for more deep songs. The animation is amazing. I liked the fact that it acts more like an anime with more expressive eyes and more fluent movements. And the designs are more ""kawaii"" then other films. Not everyone's cup of tea, but has it's charm. Finally, the feminism part feels forced. I don't mind strong female characters, if it weren't for the fact that most males were treated like weaklings. I mean, in the backstory, it was said that San Yi had to all her job by herself, but outside of the band, no male was shown as nothing more than just victims of girls power. However, I really liked the tale about San Yi, since it explains about the panda powers. And also, that movie didn't shy away with some things, like it showed pads for a couple of times. I think it's important to tell girls about periods, since it's natural and there's no need to keep that a secret.

I can say that it's concept is great, and even some elements were well done like soundtrack, animation, main heroine and some plot elements, but secondary characters just needed more screen time, and maybe it just needed to tone down feminism moments a bit. It will probably be loved by preteen and teen girls, since they are the perfect target audience for this. But others can watch as well. I honestly almost enjoyed the film, but it needed more polishing for a great score! Still, had a decent time with it!","24 August 2022",6,0,1
"Turning Red","This is a very cleverly written coming-of-ale tale that hits directly in the feels for women everywhere. While its main storyline obviously has a double meaning, there's more to this film. It shows what good female friendships can be like as well as the innate bond between a mother and daughter. There are laugh out loud moments that accompany some all too relatable situations.

Turning Red is very well done from a technical standpoint point, but also offers all the feel-good vibes you could ask for. Your kids will enjoy it, and so will you.

Verdict: Watch.","30 March 2022",7,0,4
"Turning Red","I came into this movie not really knowing anything about it, I had seen clips on the internet but that was about it, and so I wasn't disappointed when I finished it. Well to be honest it was just your average Pixar movie to me, and I felt like it was a lot of fun, and is enjoyable for the whole family to watch. I think the story was different and have never seen anything like this before, so it was a little unique in that way. I do think the protagonist of the movie wasn't the strongest, and was annoying at times, but did become better towards the end on how relatable of a character she was. I would recommend this movie for all movie goers especially Disney and Pixar fans.","1 May 2022",6,0,2
"Turning Red","This movie was pretty enjoyable. It's nice to see some diversity that doesn't feel forced. The main characters are likable and have very distinct personalities. Sure there are some stereotypical tropes but it's played for humor and I think it works really well. I noticed that some complained about how over the top it was but the message was still well conveyed, at least in the beginning. My only problem is the middle and end. The characters started to feel 2 dimensional and the plot felt rushed. The message of the story was beautiful and heart-warming I wish they just stuck something more emotional instead of a big monster fight.","22 June 2022",7,0,4
"Turning Red","You are dead inside if you cannot related to this movie. Maybe the Best PG movie about puberty. When I watched the trailer I was kind of turned off by the animation style. But the animation style suits the movie. I also liked how racists got mad at this movie. It's fun seeing grown racists just getting mad.","11 March 2022",10,2,12
"Turning Red","The beautiful animation was there and they had a great message about growing up as a woman, but this movie just didn't have the Pixar magic. I don't know if it was the weird art choices to make the movie look anime or if it was the cringeworthy jokes that will be outdated in just a couple years... but the movie just didn't feel ""Pixar"". In terms of animated movies, it was a decent film that I would recommend to families but in terms of Pixar movies, it just match the brilliance of their other films.","18 March 2022",6,1,6
"Turning Red","Pixar films are known for being incisive and emotionally rooted, and turning red doesn't disappoint on that.

Turning red is a triumphant coming of age story that's beaming in diversity (with Chinese, Korean and Indian characters) and rooted in cultural representation. People who think Turning red is centred on Asian culture only will be wrong, because the issues that it raises are as universal as they come; Turning red deftly handles the various themes it deals with, and delivers an easy form of humour to keep things gliding smoothly. The 2000s styling is also a beautiful choice.

With a heartfelt story, stunning visuals and score, Turning red is undoubtedly one of the best animations of 2022.","10 December 2022",8,0,2

It is amazing to see stories written by women for women in the mainstream media.","14 March 2022",10,3,9
"Turning Red","It's one of the worst Pixar works I've ever seen.

After the ""Soul"" animation, currently two of the animations released by pixar are not acceptable at all.","22 March 2022",5,3,8
"Turning Red","I don't understand why this movie got so much hate? People saying that the art style is bad, actually in fact Turning Red is the one of the Pixars movie with very great facial expressions, super expressive. The story is original yet keeping the Pixar magic alive, its one of the best pixar magical movies since Coco and Soul. Sure the animation looks different than other pixar movie but its the diversity, Luca has the same art style but compared to Turning Red, Turning Red is way more detailed and expressive.

Lets talk about people who said this movie is cringe. Yeah! There's some cringey moments of the movie but that's the point of the movie! It potrays us back in the days we reached puberty, crushing on someone else, feeling like we're adult and feeling like such a boss and doing cringey moments. And that's relatable! The diversity in this movie are so real its really amazing aswell.

And also this movie target audience is for tweens and adults, 14+. Some parents saying there's so many inappropriate scenes in the movie that's not for kids. Hey, Pixar grew up, and never thinks that every animated movie is for kids, no. Some animated movies target audience rn some of them are for teenagers, so make sure to read the movie reviews first parents! And also this movie is all about the time where we grew up and starting to let go of our parents because we wanted to feel more adult at that puberty time, and it potrays them all in Turning Red.

One of Pixar's masterpiece that went to streaming services, sadly. The visual is amazing but thank you pixar!","11 March 2022",10,6,25
"Turning Red","The movie was ok, not what I was expecting but overall it reminded me of my teenage years. I like that the movie was set in Toronto and showed the cultural side of the city. My daughter liked the movie and she enjoyed the songs from 4-town.","13 March 2022",7,2,7
"Turning Red","My 14 year old granddaughter thought ""it was terrible"". And yet, she's the target audience. I decided to watch it myself. I think my granddaughter was being kind when she only described it as ""terrible"". And absolutely awful movie that completely missed the mark.","14 July 2022",1,2,9
"Turning Red","Pixar's latest shall undoubtedly evoke a surprising amount of outrage within parents and an immense quantity of questions within their children. While Pixar continues its usually successful technical streak, it dares to explore more young adult themes like hormones and a teenager's search for individuality, making 'Turning Red' stand out. The outcome might be imperfect, yet this film could evolve into a real classic, of which kids today will later grow to understand and value the emotional lessons and nostalgia.","12 March 2022",7,2,9
"Turning Red","I loved this movie.

For a movie that encourages kids to build an identity independent of their parents, its quite hilarious to see a bunch of terrible parents complain about how this film teaches kids to rebel and then has a weird thing for the teens making money being celebrities. ""hint hint, these are exactly the kind of parents that reflect the mother in this film.

The mother daughter story had a very unique twist in that the daughter doesn't begin as a rebel but becomes one after she cant take the helicopter mother which is used to cringingly good effect here. The ending too is a bit too neatly wrapped up but this is a family film so you can't ask for more unless it goes into deeper themes and tones.

Animation is manic and anime-inspired. The characters, while diverse, are still very western.

The father is quite spineless and could have been portrayed better. The same goes for the mother's family. But the protagonist steals the show and I love the film just for her being in it.

This is also the first family animated film to feature pads and mention periods, which is weird because its a normal bodily function and yet we have little to no portrayal of it in family films.","4 April 2022",8,0,4
"Turning Red","There is a lot of reasons to like and dislike this movie the visuals were great and the friends dynamic was the best part although I wish they spent more time developing all of them the movie has its cringe worthy moments like humor and emotional moments feel really forced more often then not the worst part though had to be some of the character's writing could have been better and the plot was way too predictable to the point where most viewers could guess exactly what will happen in this movie if they pay attention

Overall:
If you watch the trailer think you like this movie you probably will like or at least think it's just ok but if you think you won't like it you probably won't but this movie is not the inappropriate 1/10 movie like some people claim it is its just made for a more 10 and older crowd hint hint why it's PG and not G.","14 March 2022",5,2,5
"Turning Red","Wonderful and heartwarming little gem of a movie. The protagonist is realistic in her behavior, dialog and mannerisms, the friendships and dynamics with other children feels real. As a child of early 2000s who is now a mother, the mother and daughter both felt very real to me.

People all over the world have grown up acting as if they are the white male hero because there were simply not enough heroes that looked like the rest of us. I don't see why it's so difficult for the white men who leave the negative reviews to try and do the same. Their lack of imagination should not be penalizing this film. If I can play and be Harry Potter when playing with my friends, they can very well be Mei Mei or her mom.","14 March 2022",10,3,9
"Turning Red","I never thought I would use these two things in a statement but...
Pixar has made a better version of Big Mouth with appealing looking characters, a well written script, actual clever humor (the most in any Pixar movie and done by a woman nonetheless) all within 90 minutes than in 5 to 6 seasons and I mean it.","20 March 2022",9,2,7

Pixar always does well job in its movies big things popout like toy story franchise which is best animated franchise of alltime, and these messages popout and give us morality rules, being better person ,so i highly adored this flick also reccomend it highly both parents and children should sit on the couch and enjoy this memorable ,cute ,adventure,comedy coming of age animated flick i gave it 10/10 i wish icould give more....","20 March 2022",10,1,4
"Turning Red","For most of the audience, this movie is just another Disney-like family movie with a predictable happy ending.

But from a Chinese perspective , it is too real to be a foreign language movie.

Many episodes or actions are telling a story of a Chinese kid's childhood.

The education of Honor your parents which is stem from confucianism, A over controlled Mother and a invisible father, the big burden of a long history family, all of these remind me of my real life.

There are many ways to address the problems in a drama, but in reality, the problem still exist and will last forever.","18 May 2022",10,2,5
"Turning Red","Nice story but graphics was over done ! Ok to watch it once with kids . They liked it. Story was a bit lengthy , and could have been cut short . Nevertheless it was a good watch overall.","4 April 2022",7,0,3
"Turning Red","What a lovely movie.

Mei as a character is deeply likable, goofy, smart and charming, and it is so good to see her on screen. You can absolutely believe that she's a 12 year old girl and the movie lovingly points out all the ups and downs of it. Her relationship with her friends was delightful to see - you can really believe these girls love each other, and their friendship is just heartwarming. I particularly loved the way her mother was handled - without going into spoilers, it manages to perfectly nail the conflict part of it and the sympathetic, making for a flawed character that you just love.

The themes of this movie are also handled fantastically. The metaphor of the red panda and the way Mei interacts with that part of herself is handled fantastically, and the relationship everyone else had with the red panda feels exactly like what you'd expect both of a middle school and a strict family. At no point did the movie feel contrived, preachy or made me roll my eyes - I believed everything I saw, and felt every emotion without feeling like that's what the writers are forcing me to (looking at you Inside Out).

And of course the animation! Can't forget that. It is delightful - soft and goofy, and fits the tone of the movie great. There are some genuinely gorgeous shots but for the most part you deal with a soft looking movie that takes a look at the setting of early 2000s Toronto and makes me wish I lived there.

Overall, I highly recommend a watch! While there's definately some second hand embarassment - as you'd expect from a movie called Turning Red - it all serves a purpose, and either gives the movie its drama or its charm, both of which the movie has plenty of.","12 March 2022",9,3,10
"Turning Red","At it's best, Turning Red is a thoughtful coming of age story that has some subtle and not-so-subtle treatments of puberty, ""womanhood"" (although, it's a subjective notion these day as to what that means, and yours may or may not fit with the particular portrayal in the story), and to a much lesser extent the place of cultural heritage and traditional family values for people of immigrant descent. When it does these things justice, it does them particularly well, and manages to do so in a resonant, approachable, and, perhaps more importantly, very entertaining way. It's a cute film all around-cute enough to live up to its many Pixar predecessors.

At it's worst, the story can seem a little too predictable, contrived, and occasionally trite. I found myself experiencing involuntary eye rolls from time to time when the film would try a little too hard to push a little too much of a message. The plot at a high level also lacked any real suspense for me, since it proceeded in a way that just felt a bit too formulaic at times. Perhaps Pixar was struggling with itself here, trying to balance out being ""edgy"" by playing it a bit too safe. Turning Red at times felt a bit self conscious of the subject matter it was trying to explore, when I think I would have preferred it to just go ""all in"" and take some more risks. The fact that this film had buzz or controversy surrounding it, simply for the fact that it only very briefly and superficially mentions anything overt about puberty in general, or menstruation in particular, makes me shake my head. There's nothing controversial here, for viewers of any age, in my opinion, for all but the most up-tight of parents. What is there will likely fly right over the heads of younger viewers anyway, and anyone old and aware enough to understand the few references should hardly have difficulty with the extremely light touch approach with which the topics are treated. And this is where I found things to be a bit shallow. If you go into this expecting a film about periods, you'll be left lacking, but you might find enough references here to at least start a thoughtful conversation, if that's something that you're looking to do. If you're afraid of going into this because of it being awkward or potentially explicit... have no fear, there's far more fantastical cutesy stuff than Health Class going on here.

The real meat of the story here has nothing to do with physical adolescence and everything to do with coming of age, family, and finding one's own definition of self in the shadow of monolithic and potentially oppressive forces such as parental and familial expectations, conservatism, and culture. These can be things, along with other aspects of one's self, that one chooses to trap, hide, or even purge, or they can be things we can choose to explore, harness, and embrace. Here the movie succeeds much more. Still... there's a lot in the way of missed opportunities for character development. I would have liked to see the grandmother's character more fully explored and brought into the story, as well as the other relatives, for example. And the father in the story almost, but never quite does, get a moment to truly do anything of consequence.

In all, this isn't my favorite Pixar movie by far. Despite having a lot of potential, for me this one can't stand up to a comparison with films like Coco, Up, Ratatouille, or any of the Toy Story movies. I appreciate what the film is trying to do, and it attempts to tackle a lot, maybe too much, and it does it pretty well in absolute terms, but not quite as well as even a film like Inside Out in my opinion. Yet, this isn't at all a condemnation-this is a film that's both fun and at times very thoughtful and emotional, and the whole is indeed more than the sum of its parts. But I would have appreciate a bit more runtime to add just a bit more depth to the story and flesh things out a bit more. I would have liked a bit more risk, and less pulling of the punches. And I would have liked to see a slightly less neat and tidy resolution at the end to make things feel a bit more real and a bit less idealistic, given how inherently messy the subject matter is in real life (no, I don't mean THAT, no pun intended... I mean that family relationships and coming of age almost always end up being bittersweet in some way and involve sacrifice, not having our cake and eating it too). That this story which is so much about human drama and the fundamental truth that we only START to learn in adolescence that we can't please everyone, but the film ends with a happily-ever-after resolution to all the conflicts and tensions, seems ironically juvenile for a film about the beginning of adolescence. It's much more Disney and less Pixar, which often tends to put a lot more complexity into their storytelling and endings.

Glad I saw this, I enjoyed it, but not one I'd feel bad if I never had a second viewing.","1 May 2022",7,0,2
"Turning Red","Turning Red was an expertly animated movie and I think one of the first major productions I've ever seen that feels realistic to what being a teenager is really like: painfully awkward and hilariously cringey. That felt so very lifelike and brought me right back to being 13 years old. I love that Pixar captured that dimension of the human experience and thought the overall message of the film was great... I can imagine it started some helpful conversations between kids and parents.

I can't really speak firsthand to the cultural authenticity of this film as I am neither Chinese nor Canadian, but I appreciated the attention to detail making this film feel applaud Pixar naming Domee Shi to be the director of this film. I can't imagine this film being as good as it was without Shi as director. So... it's a well-made, beautifully animated, film that explored an interesting slice of life and adolescence that I haven't seen explored to death before. So why am I not rating the final product higher than I am? Turning Red really just didn't grab me that much as a story. It was a good film and I appreciated it, it just was something I'm aware wasn't quite for me.","3 July 2022",6,0,2
"Turning Red","The designers has done a good part in this movie. But overall, the acting is overly dramatic, like anime, making it looks weird and silly. I hope the director can do something more mature and profound.","30 May 2022",5,2,5
"Turning Red","Terrible. Had to force my self to watch it. It's so wrong that a kids movie is about fantasizing boys. Yes main character is 14 years old but the audience for this movie is like 0-10 year old kids as well. It's such a shame that our values in life changed so much.

It the movie still has an okay rating, probably because people are not forcing themselves to finish it and not bothering to give a terrible rating.","1 April 2022",1,5,17
"Turning Red","If you are a parent and you see this movie and you decide that your kids can't watch it then you are the one that needs to watch it.

More than anything this movie is about an overbearing mother who won't give her child space to be her own person or grow up.

Kids are not just small creatures that have to respect you and do what you say. Kids need to be respected too. At one point, Meilin says something along the lines of ""if we're going to try so hard to be good and still not be treated right then what is the point?"" Every parent needs to hear this. If you have a good child that listens to and respects you, you need to reward them with the same respect and the same open ear.

9/10 teenagers have some sort of rebellious streak. If you talk to them and actually take the time to get to know them as they become their own person, you can be a part of their adolescence. You can have adult conversations with them about why you don't want them to go to the concert or to the party. ""No, because I said so"" is not good enough.

If you just refuse to let them change and force rules on them without explanation, they are going to sneak around and lie to do what they want to do.

This is a very good, well written, and funny movie and anyone talking about censoring it from their children needs to look inward.","18 March 2022",8,2,6
"Turning Red","Mei and her friends can be cringe at times, but I like that because it's hard to accurately represent a teenage girl without making it cringe. I am a teenager myself and this is accurate. This does have mentions of ""The red peony"", which is why I recommend that younger kids shouldn't watch this. But you can also use this to introduce your kids to the topic so there's that!","30 June 2022",10,1,5
"Turning Red","In Turning Red, everything is literally spectacular, the performances of the cast (especially the actress who plays Mei), story and its aim, theme, point, and subject, direction, screenplay, cinematography, tone, and the perfect runtime which is neither too long nor too short are all nearly perfect.

Regarding the flaws, the only two things that I criticize in Turning Red are the soundtrack, which I didn't see anything special in it, and that the movie did not get enough into the abilities of the red panda.

But despite these two flaws, Turning Red is one of the best animation movies that I watched, and I recommend everyone to watch it. When it comes to the score, I give Turning Red 9 out of 10.","12 April 2022",9,0,1
"Turning Red","I don't want to delve into the technical points, as they are the same as in all the films. With texture, line, cores and environments that make the eyes water, they look beautiful, in addition to all the representation with different characters.

What I would like to delve into is the excellence that Pixar has in making films that reach all audiences, such as: Soul, Inside Out, Toy Story 3, Wall-E and Luca. Regardless of age, the films deal with subjects that everyone understands in their experiences, children or adults. Subjects such as puberty, maturation, internal beasts, paths, clash of culture and ancestry, are some of the subjects that the film deals with.

But the focus is Mei-Mei's maturation, a subject treated in Fun, por, where feelings are treated as internal, while in Red: Crescer é Fera, the subject is treated as external. ""Seriously, if our inner monsters were going to 'attack' it can come out of us, as well as showing how we should stay and use these inner beasts.

Overall, I really liked it, I stuck to the soundtrack and the original songs hahah, very good! Reminding me of the heyday of boy bands in the 2000s. Some might associate famous K-Pop bands that are the heyday of the present day.","31 March 2022",8,0,2
"Turning Red","An adorable movie with a lot of funny moments. It's been a while since I saw an animation by Disney/Pixar that didn't feel formula-made. The jokes were on point and made it fun to watch for all ages.

This movie was emotional but without overglorifying or villanizing specific characters, which created a nice theme about how not everything is so black and white (, or shall we say red?) without being overly preachy.

I also enjoy more eastern representation in animation movies and I think this one did a fine job at that. All in all, this would be a movie that I think is equally entertaining as it is actually educational for kids to learn about their identity and social relationships.","10 April 2022",8,0,2
"Turning Red","It is funny.

Major events hit with almost no weight behind them which is odd considering it's PIXAR. The pacing is fast and snappy which is good for comedy, but its lack of seriousness leaves it feeling like a mix between a C tier Marvel/Dreamworks movie (especially in the 3rd act).

It's been done better.

I've enjoyed ""Inside Out"", ""The Owl Hose"", ""Spirited Away"", ""Infinity Train"", ""Komi Can't Communicate"", ""A Silent Voice"", ""Kaguya Sama"", ""In This Corner of the World"", ""Harry Potter"", ""She-Ra PoP"", and ""Steven Universe"". I had a hard time relating.

It made me laugh but it didn't make me cry.

Side note: this doesn't feel like 2002. ""all about that hustle am I right""?","13 March 2022",7,1,9
"Turning Red","It's been so good to watch a pixar film after a long time, Pixar never failed to make us entertanined and feel good, Most of the scene we could reflect ourselves in the movie with many eye-catching scenes althrough the movie with a happy ending, bear scenes are super fun in the movie. Want to see more of the Pixar films.","12 March 2022",10,3,10

"Turning Red","This Pixar animated film has set in Toronto, Canada. A story about a 13-years-old Meilin Lee (voiced by Rosalie Chiang) whose going through puberty. Her puberty is not just like other girls' but also makes her suddenly turn into a red panda.

This film captures the reality that happens while growing up in a hilarious way, when it is not just about fun and enjoyable journal, there are a lot of ""first-time"" things that are unexpectedly very shocking. It is not a ""heavy""-to-watch film while it also teaches you how important friends and family especially when growing up.

It's a fun and relatable film to relieve stress.","7 May 2022",8,1,3
"Turning Red","The plot boils down to coming out of your ""scout"" stage, where your family approval means everything then balancing having real friends and becoming a rebellions teenager. We've all been there, what I love is the cringe factor representation of being a 13 year old girl in 2002 (which I WAS LMFAO). I felt a personal connection to the young girls, oogling boys, daydreaming about boy bands, drawing embarrassing doodles in my notebooks lol Legit things us younger teens did in the early 00s! Even the lack of privacy that Mei goes thought from her mom, hit home for me. This might miss the mark for gen z, but us ""older"" kids will definitely love it. 10 outta 10.","27 March 2022",10,3,7
"Turning Red","I watched this with my daughter and she is of the persuasion that most movies are rushed and boring. This kept her concentration for a while and without the added pressure to enjoy something she had fun. As did I.

It's a good story, though could have been polished a little better as it dulls down in parts but overall you can't go wrong. It's a Disney film that rekindles Disney moments unlike it's more recent IPs.","26 June 2022",7,0,4
"Turning Red","It's funny but kinda cringe because it isnt like some movie that adult could watch or even a 3rd year child who wats to see a 11 yo girl talk about boys and life but it wasn't that weird as it happened the movie was showing the importance of friendship and stuff like any other Disney Pixar movie they had to keep a moral value but it just reminded me of Sofia the first for some reason. But it actually showed the typicality of Asian moms so that just bought the movie few points.","17 March 2022",6,0,6
"Turning Red","I actually really enjoyed watching this movie . I thought it was funny and it was a really cool idea for a movie . My son enjoyed, I enjoyed it an so did my fiancé . Anyone complaining about it because it's about puberty and periods need to stop being so sensitive . Honestly a lot of kids prob won't even know it's about that unless an adult says something . We learn about puberty in school. It's health education. Overall I give the movie an A .","15 March 2022",10,2,4
"Turning Red","I can start classifying this new Pixar movie as brave, after all it touches on subjects that years ago animated films wouldn't even think about bringing to the screens, but was that enough to make a good movie? Let's find out now. I can say that I really liked ""Turning Red"" because as a good animation, the film flows very well and the script and direction are very successful in giving deep layers to their characters without being in that typical caricature of characters of Asian origin, in this case here Chinese, the protagonist Meilin is very strong, she has all the characteristics of a person who is going to adolescence, intensity, euphoria, search for a dream, pressure from family members in perfection and the punctual breaks of the fourth wall bring us even closer her and the situations she goes through when she is a red panda made me laugh a lot. Her friends are also great, full of style and strong personality and they complement the protagonist, making for a very strong bond, now the mother with the voice of Sandra Oh is the type of oppressive character who treats her daughter as the most perfect in the world and demanding more than she can give, but little by little we discover the origin of all this oppression, the same goes for the father who at first is an expendable character only as the narrative progresses, we also learn about him . As for the unfolding of the plot, I have already stated that it is a very enjoyable movie to watch and it works well with cause and effect and it is easy to overlook the attitudes that the characters take because it is quite plausible that teenagers acting on impulse and not thinking about the consequences, I just thought that the final sequence deviated a little bit from the consistency that the screenplay proposed when trying to forcefully create chaos at a macro level. Other than that, the message of the movie is very beautiful and speaks openly about anxiety and how we are pressured to be perfect in the eyes of some people and forget about our mental health, and I loved the final sentence about unleashing the monster inside you. ""Turning Red"" is another hit (for a change) by Pixar.","13 March 2022",8,2,7
"Turning Red","This is a nice movie for an adult but when I think Amit Disney movies I think about kids; is it really for kids? What message does this movie give a child? A 13 year old kid s/he should concentrate in study or in a constructive thing. May be I'm too orthodox but the dream live this movie shows for a 13 year old is not apt. May be a 21 year old can have that life.

We are living in such an era where being perfect or studious or obedient seems to be a mistake.

I'm really shocked with the message this movie has otherwise it is a great movie.","7 April 2022",5,0,1
"Turning Red","Turning Red is a coming-of-age film about a 13-year-old girl discovering herself. In her case, it was a red panda. The film sets in 2002, in Toronto. I love the diversity in this film. It is very heartfelt and genuine. The people behind this film did such a great job.","22 March 2022",8,0,6
"Turning Red","I found all the characters (apart from the dad and grandad) very annoying and over emotional.

Didn't do it for me personally, most of the characters were VERY over emotional and much too energetic.

There were a few good scenes but I wouldn't recommend watching this if you are easily annoyed by annoying people. The mother was also very infuriating (I know that is what they were aiming for but they overdid it in my opinion). The music was good though.","12 June 2022",2,2,9
"Turning Red","Cute movie, not sure what's with all the negative reviews on here, but super cute family kinda movie and really touches on the mother daughter relationship. Enjoy!","22 March 2022",9,3,9
"Turning Red","So imma be honest with this review,I loved this movie so much! It truly resembles what it is like to be in middle school as a girl! Mean boys,periods,friends,boybands, and trying to be mature but still trying to be a kid! But there is a reason it isn't on the kids account! My family and I were surprised when they mentioned getting your period five times! I do think this movie is for girls older then 5th grade. Other people besides that will say it was a waste of time and was the worst movie,but believe me I LOVED this movie. That is MY review.(And PS my relationship w my mom is still great you people are just very protective!)","1 June 2022",10,1,6
"Turning Red","I saw Turning Red, and it wasn't top-tier Pixar, but it definitely wasn't Pixar at their lowest. The film takes place in Toronto in 2002, and it follows Meilin Lee, a 13-Year Old Chinese-Canadian Girl. When her puberty hits, she turns into a giant red panda. Now, the premise sounded pretty dumb to me, but then I remembered that this was Pixar, and they made a movie about a rat controlling a chef super awesome, so I had a lot of hope for the movie.

Turning Red was good, but nothing more than that. The animation was as gorgeous as ever, and the characters was likeable. It didn't have the amount of emotions Pixar usually brings to the table, but it was an alright story about family, friendship, and even puberty. I felt like Pixar handled Puberty correctly in this movie, and managed to have an entire action sequence at the end, which was pretty fun! Overall, Turning Red was a alright Pixar Movie, and that's sort of a weird thing to say about one of the best studios in the movie industry.","9 April 2022",6,0,0
"Turning Red","If I'm honest I could have predicted the plot after the first 15 minutes, but nonetheless I still found this an excellent film with smart comedy, although you will cringe at some points, and an excellent development of characters. Definetly worth a watch with family.","26 March 2022",8,2,5
"Turning Red","Full of annoying characters that are so played out, & advocates for lying or deception of your parents. Too old themes for younger children as far as menstruation topics. Disney can no longer just be fun & innocent anymore, can it? It has to intentionally push certain liberal ideologies, unfortunately. They will lose many patrons due to this & Lightyear. It should be okay to allow any age kid watch Disney, but the problem is , IT ISN'T ANYMORE. Definitely prescreen all Disney & Pixar before subjecting your children to it!","4 July 2022",3,4,10
"Turning Red","This film lives up to the standard of what Pixar has been releasing recently. Perfectly just above average. The first 15 minutes or so put me off to the point where I was ready to stop watching as to how awkward and cringe worthy the characters are.

It picks up after that though and comes through into its own with some genuinely funny moments and a message never really seen before in a family film. If you can ignore a lot of questionable character choices then there is something for die hard Pixar fans to enjoy, young and old. Might start an awkward conversation for parents with kids more on the younger side.","31 March 2022",7,0,2
"Turning Red","I love this movie and can relate with it so much. It really highlights aspects of growing up that aren't talked about enough and shows that it's really not anything to be ashamed about. I love that it really portrays finding your independence.","20 March 2022",10,2,6
"Turning Red","Disney/Pixar turns over another card in its efforts to promote its social agenda. While on the surface Turning Red mimics other Disney/Pixar story lines, the underlying themes are not appropriate for young viewers. It's no wonder this wasn't released in theaters. Very disappointed with the latest effort by Disney to influence young children.","1 April 2022",2,3,13
"Turning Red","Turning Red is the First Pixar movie that dipped into a topic that no other Film studio has wanted to try and explain,, Puberty. And Turning Red using the red panda as a metaphor as it does it really well. It goes headfirst into the awkwardness of a situation like that and shows Change in Mei as the Film progresses and her becoming her own person. Realistically with parents this may be a movie that very young audiences may not get and understand but still can be enjoyable by people that know what Puberty is like and the challenges it comes with.","29 March 2022",7,0,2
"Turning Red","My partner (38) and I (40) just watched it. Just the two of us. Both of us thoroughly enjoyed it - we're both Europeans, atheists and liberals. There's nothing wrong with this movie - unless you are of conservative persuasion - and this is who many of the 1-star reviews seem to be from. Yes, if you're from a family where values and tradition were everything, better skip this one. If you want the typical Disney formula of entertainment + message etc., then ""Turning Red"" is a pretty safe bet.","27 March 2022",7,1,9
"Turning Red","This movie is so relatable I was that weird girl in middle school who hyper fixated on boys or boy bands, except my 4town was Inuyasha and Sasuke but I had friends who related with me, I felt the story on a personal level. It didn't matter that she was asian (or that she's a red panda), I felt so represented. Is movie is officially in my top 5 Pixar and the team who created this film should be proud of themself.","21 March 2022",10,2,4
"Turning Red","Been tired of recent Pixar films like encanto or raya and the last dragon trying hard to recreate coco and moana

turning red had it's flaws and weak characters but atleast it was fun to watch and something bit different.

I kinda liked it's visual comedy.","1 April 2022",6,0,3
"Turning Red","Absolutely loved the animation but the movie was filled with cliches, like the mother, ugh, saved myself some time and turned it off.

Amazing for kids and teens that aren't as used to the same plot lines.","30 March 2022",9,0,8
"Turning Red","The best animated films can be watched by all ages, wth comedy for both kids and tongue in cheek humour for adults that goes over the heads of children, without them knowing.

Whilst generally aimed at the teenager with angst, luckily it does not come across as some kind of handbook on the troubles of maturing.

The animation is great and everything is up to the standard that I would hope to come out of such a studio.","2 May 2022",8,0,3
"Turning Red","Nothing incredible, definitely one of pixar's weaker films. However, it is nowhere near as bad as some people make it out to be. Visually great, some funny jokes. Its very predictable but at the end of the day it kind of knows that so it isn't too malicious in trying to lie to the audience.","14 March 2022",6,1,2
"Turning Red","As someone who was once a 13 year old girl the nostalgia was real. I feel like it represented that time in my life very well. And the mother daughter relationship was incredibly relevant. I may have cryed during the entire end.","20 March 2022",9,1,5
"Turning Red","Yes! Finally a VERY GOOD Pixar movie (Inside Out or Coco are OK) since 2011. I love 1990-2005 culture and this is my perfect movie. Yeah, I'm man but, I liked so much the film and the humor. It deserves a 8!","21 March 2022",8,1,4
"Turning Red","This movie was strange, creative and entertaining family movie ! The kids loved it and thought it was colorful and fun. The animation style was unique and authentic, the music was catchy , and overall the film stood out in unique ways. Highly recommend it!","12 March 2022",10,3,9
"Turning Red","I can't believe Pixar dared to release a movie that threatens my sweet 10yo daughter's safe sheltered life as much as this one did.

First, of course, the so-called 'red panda'. Everybody is all up in arms over the period allegory, but what about its size? Meilin is 5x the size of an actual red panda!? What am I going to tell my daughter next time we go to the zoo? Seriously Pixar.

Second, the assault on math. A boyband with 5 members called '4-Town'? I am already afraid for her next math test, putting all these distorting views in her brain. If she gets a B I will sue.

I never understood 'leftist woke views' until this movie. Bad math, bad biology, showing the many actual cultures in any 2020s city, and discussing the frights of any (pre-)teen in a relatable way. Damn you socialists!","12 March 2022",9,4,13
"Turning Red","Ever read product reviews where someone gives a poor rating because the bought the wrong item? Same goes for every review complaining that they watched a movie that didn't cater to them.

When an audience review puts its focus on an ""agenda"" being pushed, take a look at how much attention they give to the film in question. If it's not already obvious that they're just part of a review bombing campaign, they simply don't want you to see the movie that they couldn't be bothered to actually see for themselves. But at least they make it pretty easy to tell they're really just here to point fingers and use movie discussions as soapboxes for an agenda they pretend not to have.

If a PG-rated animated film about a girl entering puberty is offensive to some because of some maxi-pads (oh. Heaven's mercy, please don't let your children enter a grocery store!), then what do these offended individuals think the transforming-into-a-red-panda plot is actually about?

The animation has plenty of modem Pixar trademarks while paying generous homage to the quieter Studio Ghibli dramas. The characters are often impulsive, overreacting, kinda like most cartoon characters. Personally, I appreciate the irony of a pre-teen character thinking she's self-aware and actuslly independent. (Like conspiracy theorists who fancy themselves immune to conditioning or propaganda.). It's an introductory character monologue, not a political manifesto.","4 July 2022",8,0,4
"Turning Red","The friendship, and family, you don't to be perfect, also the picture is so gorgeous, ZEN, Chinese tradition, love it! It's really make me cry!#(why it has character limits.....","13 March 2022",10,3,9
"Turning Red","Beautifully animated, the angst and body-horror of puberty was weirdly palpable in a movie kids will watch, but I thought it was so much fun. And the 2002 Toronto setting was a an interesting way of eliminating the shadow of social media.","20 June 2022",7,0,4

"Turning Red","This movie perfectly encloses the experiences of growing up as a young girl, generational trauma, the strength of friendship, and becoming your true self.

It shares the embarrassing stories that many 13 year olds can really relate to. Its not watered down or made to be more palatable to male audiences, its true to what the movie stands for. That growing up is hard, especially when your family doesn't approve of what you're becoming. That most everyone has had struggles in the same way the main character of this movie has.

It openly speaks on puberty and menstrual cycles, and the 13 year olds act like actual 13 year olds! They are all boy crazy and unapologetically act like themselves, support each other and love each other.

This movie is exactly what we needed and more. I see many people calling Turning Red ""cringeworthy,"" you are correct! This movie is meant to show all aspects of growing up, including the embarrassing parts and it does an incredible job.

If you grew up in the 2000s as a young girl, I think you will love this movie. It is so incredible to have a movie that has left me feeling so seen in a way that no other has ever done before.","14 March 2022",10,1,2
"Turning Red","I think they wanted the film to be a metaphor for a young teen going through puberty, but the characters literally come out and state the metaphor immediately. It's so in your face that it's not even fun to discover along with the main character her ""coming of age"". Seriously could they be any more obvious? It just ends up being weird and creepy instead. The characters are boring and unrelatable, the plot predictable, the whole movie forgettable. It felt like they were trying too hard with the soundtrack to save the film. I usually love Pixar films, but this falls flat. Unless you are a 13 year old girl, don't waste your time. This is not your typical Pixar film that's fun for the whole family.","11 April 2022",1,1,3
"Turning Red","He is unexpectedly hilarious and very funny. Many probably look only at the panda. But the main character is not bad, she is also interesting, there is a little inadequacy in her and others, I personally don't like it, but on the other hand it's a plus. If not for these cons or oddities, we would not worry about the heroine. There is a drop of anime, of course not in the style of Pixar, but thank you that there is not so much of it. So the cartoon came to me especially more for the panda. The whole cartoon is hilarious, cute, strange, and so on in circles.

Pluses: animation, story, comedy, soundtrack and music, well, maybe the characters.

Cons: I don't like the emotions of the characters, but for memes, especially for pixar, I understand who created it, but this is superfluous. And sometimes the behavior of heroes, but I understand that children. And it seems that some guys are like stupid angels. It would be nice if guys could also love girls the same way they love guys.

And so I'm waiting for the continuation of the form of one or two short films, or to make a complete second part.","12 March 2022",8,1,5
"Turning Red","This is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen if not the worst. I hate all the characters, including the way overprotective mom, the cringe and unrelatable daughter, and the also unrelatable friends. The movie was meant to be funny but I didn't laugh a single time, the plot is very boring, and I spent most of the movie wanting to not watch it. Considering the target audience won't understand the metaphor for the panda, and the fact that even my twelve year old girl thought the movie was terrible, I don't think anyone should suffer through this.","20 June 2022",1,4,11
"Turning Red","This movie was wonderful. The imagery and storyline kept us adults entertained, as well as our 3 year old. This is a coming of age story and, despite what those on social media claim, it's totally harmless and innocent. I also LOVED the making of. So refreshing to see larger representation in Disney/Pixar movies!!","21 June 2022",10,2,6
"Turning Red","I LOVE THIS! The animation, the plot, and everything about this! I love how the story ends. This is so cool! You can watch it with everyone. Also, character development is awesome! Especially, mei-mei's mother. There is a lot to discover here. This is also for the parents (for their parenting skills) because the character of mei's mother here is happening in real life.","20 March 2022",10,3,9
"Turning Red","I must say, it was a cute movie and good portrayal of a Chinese family coz it's pretty true for me but on top of that, i love the concept of acceptance & love regardless of appearance. Overall, it was entertaining n cute.","24 April 2022",7,0,2
"Turning Red","I am writing this review while watching this film I created an account just to say this. It is one of the cringiest most embarrassing pieces of media that I have ever seen in my entire life it's so cringe it not even funny like who is even the target demographic so parts of the films were mildly funny but most of the time it was just embarrassing.","24 July 2022",1,4,11
"Turning Red","#TurningRed (now streaming on Disney+) is one of my FAVE Pixar movies ever....it's funny, smart, relatable, heartwarming and it's so unique in its style. I love that kids are going to grow up with something this. I really had a huge smile watching it, it's good.","12 March 2022",9,2,15
"Turning Red","It was a well-made film. Too bad it didn't make to the theater. I was touched by the scene that Meimei held her mom's hand and they walked through the bamboo as Mom was ""growing up"" from a little girl to Mom today.","3 May 2022",9,1,3
"Turning Red","My 4 year old son and I decided to watch this new movie on Disney+ last weekend. Since then, it has been on repeat in my house. My son loved the movie. It was cute and had a good message behind it. I've seen some reviews about it being inappropriate and I don't think this movie is inappropriate at all.","16 March 2022",10,3,8
"Turning Red","As a native Chinese, I must say it's a brilliant and connotative movie. It may be underestimated by the white community.

Firstly, Turning Red makes a pun - for its surface meaning, it indicates the power making Mei turn in to Red panda; for its deep meaning, it indicates the menstruation and love (red face) during a girl's adolescence.

In brief, two main themes in the film are well portrayed. The first is the traditional Chinese clan culture that binds the Chinese. It seems that Chinese second generation immigrants have come to a democratic society where they can do what they want, but in fact, they are constantly under the cultural control of their family. You can find the good part from the Chinese family culture, but there also are absolutely laggard and decayed part about it. And those bad parts are what actually hinder the integration of Chinese immigrants into the local community. There is a famous idea of Chinese tradition, it said, ""Honor the decree of heaven, contain the desires of human."" It seems to be a good idea, but actually it was executed as a rule repressing human nature. In fact, it means that you can't do want you desire, such as love and sex, you can only do the right things that defined by your family and government. In this movie, the brutish nature of red panda is actually a metaphor of the repressed human nature and personality. So I can bet that the directors know Chinese culture very well.

The second part is about feminist and power. The film explores these ideas further. In a nutshell, feminism is an affirmative action movement, a movement that fights for female free and equal rights. But in the film, we can see that even in such a matriarchal society, young female are still dominated and controlled by elder female who held the power. Young people can't do anything fancy which they like. This is the second theme that the film explores: power. Power is genderless, there is only the controlled ,in other words - advanced, and the backward, which will be infinitely expandable.","12 March 2022",9,2,5
"Turning Red","It was totally nice and cute ,complex and good points but it's better for more than 25.

Before this movie you should now about different religions and different psychological approches.you should now about the number of 4 in different cultures.

I think it was good for syncing characters.

I've starred 10.","21 March 2022",10,3,7
"Turning Red","I was 13 in the 00's, and I was happy to see a more 'accurate' reflection of what it was like to be a teen then in this movie. Dorky but loving friends, making silly videos on a camcorder, hiding secret notebooks from your parents, etc. I saw some reviews say that this movie was aimed at ""Tiktok girls"", but the majority of the people on that app are Gen Z; this was for millennials! Of course, this isn't to say that Gen-Z'ers can't relate to Turning Red, but rather that this movie encapsulated what many people my age experienced in junior high. I also loved that periods were talked about freely (for a Disney movie, that is). It's nice to see it normalized, to see it not portrayed as inherently traumatic, but as something that you learn how to handle and accept as someone going into young adulthood. Periods should not be a tragic end to girlhood, but rather a blossoming into womanhood. I think the movie did a good job of showing that, even if Mei did not end up literally getting her period, the red panda was still a good euphemism.","19 March 2022",9,1,7
"Turning Red","Anyone who rates this less than 8/10, has problems
Truth be told, its one of the best Pixar movies to date. It was very funny and the most original one I've seen for a veeeery long time. Loved that it was female-centric (something I realised after this film, we don't often see) Heartwarming & also really great laughs. Well done Domee Shi 👏 Congrats!","15 April 2022",10,1,3
"Turning Red","So looking forward to seeing this film due to love of all things red panda and all in all its enjoyable but overated by the trailer and people seeing this in rose tinted specs.

It's not the greatest in the world and over the top teenage angst over puberty and teenage crushes, cringe a plenty overuse of padding for the long 1hr 40 of it.. but at times there's little moments of class and nice touches of why the red panda is well loved in the real world by its mannerisms. Kids will like it whilst the rest will cringe over most of the incidents and morals.. seen worse in 'Dog' but all in all don't expect the best animation, it's ok.","18 March 2022",6,0,6
"Turning Red","A new favorite! ANYBODY can totally relate to this movie! Hey, to ""that"" critic, yeah dude, YOU were totally off! And you know who ""you"" are. 😶

Totally took me back to my teen years. Gave me a different perspective. GREAT family message. WELL DONE!","12 March 2022",10,3,9
"Turning Red","The movie was okay,nothing that special in my opinion. Mainly exploring what it's like to go to puberty. Kids will probably love this one but it's defently not my favourite.

The main charcters (the kids) were a bit too much for me at the start,but they grew on me as the movie kept going. The animation and style was pretty good. Felt a bit unique so i appeciate that.

The story fell flat to me,i felt like there wasn't much of a story just mostly the teens problems. I know that's the main idea of the movie but there wasn't a lot to be hooked onto. The whole concert plot thingy felt somewhat cringy and unnecessary for me. Could've either made the movie shorter or just think of something bit more interesting as a plot. Altho i do get it.

Also there was like no consequences to the cast. Everyone just sees them as giant cute pandas. ( Which they kinda are but we saw what kind of damage they can do). I know red pandas are endangered and super cute,but everyone just accepted them as if they couldn't hurt nobody.

Also the movie is set in 2002 or so but the kids talk like today's tik tokers. You see those old nokia phones and that takes you back in time,but then the kids go for a whiny ''o m g'' and u remember that it's made for a newer audience. It can defently be bit cringy at times,probably a lot more for other people,but i managed to cope with the most of it.

Maybe this could've been a better story if it was more like a mulan,or set in more of a fantasy world. Since their predecessors used the pandas in wars. But then again today's kids won't relate to that one.

All in all it's decent,cute and there were a few funny bits here and there,but not all that memorable. A couple more touching moments that stuck out,but they weren't able to hold me for too long.

It defenetly has some heart put into it,but I doubt i will watch this again anytime soon.

For passing time it's okay.","18 August 2022",6,1,2
"Turning Red","A very beautiful story, well shot and above all a real talent for talking about ""taboos"" in an intelligent way. As usual pixar has released a new gold nugget.","25 May 2022",9,0,3
"Turning Red","Why would any kids movie make it ok to be disrespectful to your parents? Sneaking around and Fantasizing about sex? Just ew. We had no idea when we watched and got blindsided!!! If you have any family values and actually want your kids to be wise and listen to you and be honest-dont bother.","29 April 2022",1,3,12
"Turning Red","A great movie about strong women, adolescence and the complicated mother/daughter relationship!!! I enjoyed this and it brought me back to my own 8th grade me and how important friends were.","28 March 2022",10,3,7
"Turning Red","This was so cute! Like gosh it was cute!! And super funny and relatable and it was very interesting to see this from another cultures point of you. It actually made me think that it's not so bad to be a girl.","15 March 2022",9,1,6
"Turning Red","Beautiful movie with a fun plot. A movie that has successfully put light on adulthood and how it shifts and makes people change and also how mothers are the important part in this phase and the way they handle things with their children. Perhaps some people would find this movie a bit too explicit because it shows directly how adulthood turns people inexplicable but it is real that this is how adulthood can be bitter.","21 May 2022",8,0,3
"Turning Red","My kids and I loved this movie! The animation is beautiful and authentic, the music was fun and catchy and overall nice interesting themes and ideas! Loved this animated movie ! Definitely a top contender for the next years Oscar's!","12 March 2022",10,3,13
"Turning Red","Terrible storyline
I watched it for the panda
I won't be buying buying a panda Teddy....and I don't think my daughter even wants one....it wasn't magical and I don't think we will be watching it again.","4 August 2022",3,1,4
"Turning Red","I like how it's set in a forgotten era, not many movies do that. The animation is more vivid than 3D animated movies these past years. There's more of an ""animated"" feel from it. The character are lovable even at there meanest and rudest. The story has a good rhythm to it. Overall this is great family movie and a much needed brightness in this day and age.","20 March 2022",8,2,6
"Turning Red","This film is quite unique unlike other classic Pixar animated films and one of the best as well. Top-notch Pixar's animation as we expected. The uplifting music is the backbone of this film. Mainly ""Nobody Like U"", a hit for the film's fictional 4 Town group is such a banger.

Glad and so radical to see how animation giant like Pixar has come along to normalise the puberty stage and addresses menstruation and the way they handled it was clever. It clearly shows periods and female puberty should be embraced, rather than be embarrassed about. Especially, The emotions of a 13-year-old Chinese Canadian girl and her emotional complexity between her and her mom and her lively friends were so executed amazingly by dramatic zoom,exaggerated poses and anime-inspired art styles.

Really a great representation of the children of immigrants and their parents and not stereotypical at most parts. The friends of Mei which are Miriam Wexler, Priya Dewan, Abby Park and Tyler's character arc felt incomplete. Also the history behind the Red Panda should've been shown more briefly as well.

I would highly recommend this film to all ages because of its relatability and utilise symbolism of puberty to talk about puberty for growing kids and also for including some inspiring life lessons like accept and embrace our fears and insecurities.","16 March 2022",9,1,6
"Turning Red","Some of this movies abundant flaws might have been overlooked, or forgiven, if this title was released late 90's or early 00's. Sadly this is from 2022 and it's painful to watch already from the opening sequence. I do not envy the people who have powered through this atrocious excuse for a movie made this decade.

The one thing I can give it is that the release of this feature film just completely and utterly baffles me. I cannot grasp how this could be green-lit and made. How no one seems to have said ""hold on a minute"".

I have not seen every single one of Pixar's movies, but almost, and this certainly is the lowest of them all and I highly doubt they'll ever release anything worse. Avoid this one.","4 November 2022",1,1,4
"Turning Red","I thought that I would really hate this movie because at the start I really didn't like any of the characters I thought they were too cringey and I thought that the main character in May was a little bit ugly/mean for a character design main girl and thought that she would be the bad girl or bully. I found her hard to like at first until I realized she was nice and relatable. Turns out I really enjoyed the film including Chinese tradition. It was fun, there was a lot of turning Stones and twists it was really interesting I kept wanting to watch more. I thought I would dislike it but I found myself laughing at some funny parts. I found her mother really controlling about periods though which was again relatable as a teen girl. I'm not sure if boys would enjoy this as much.

I didn't like that it was very anime or kawaii like a little bit try hard with young girls but I also like that I could relate to the characters liking by groups and having crushes because (I'm a teenager myself a girl)there was no annoying songs although I do believe the film could've been promoted better and put into the cinema. Based on the advertisement I based on the film on that and in the advertisement that was really annoying girls singing and that was the only part I hate it but it should've been advertised as a funny comedic bear and a girl who struggles in life but there was no TV advertisements at all no cinema showings. Despite this I'm really glad this film was created Pixar does not disappoint.","21 April 2022",9,0,2
"Turning Red","The film is based on a 13-year-old schoolgirl who can turn into a cute red panda. The film has some comedy, some family drama and much more. You'll enjoy the movie with your family.","22 March 2022",8,2,8
"Turning Red","I love this movie it's awesome and funny and I can't understand why Twitter was complaining about this awesome movie and I can't wait to watch again and again and again until I get tired of watching it and you guys can fight me but I will say this is becoming my top favorite movie and I'll tell encanto to move to the second spot because turning red has token the first slot right next to megamind.","12 March 2022",10,2,9
"Turning Red","Absolutely amazing movie. I might be biased because I'm Canadian but it was SO GOOD! The Toronto tie ins were amazing and such amazing representation for the Asian Canadian community. So cute amazing messages and honestly amazing for kids of all ages.","15 March 2022",10,3,14
"Turning Red","This is what's wrong with movies, execs and studios. Pushing the needle to kids. Kids watch a movie like this and expect a safe space for children. If you want to tell this kind of story stop marketing to younger children using cartoons.","10 April 2022",1,1,6
"Turning Red","I love the animation for this movie, and it's a nice easy-watcher whilst still being fun and meaningful. But, the cringey-boy-band song is so catchy, I can't get it out my head!","11 March 2022",8,1,3
"Turning Red","This is a great family movie, even if the story line is a bit messy. It accurately shows the dynamic of growing up with over-protective parents - the guilt you feel with disappointing them and the need to break free of some customs that are rooted in their fear of the unknown. The parts that don't work as well are how Mei resorts to selling pics of the panda (she could have made money in other ways), not enough dialogue from her dad, and why all the older women decide to lock up their pandas again. For any parents concerned, it's fine for kids to watch. Mei's eagerness to see the boy-band is the same as other Disney movies with adventurous young girls in love, eg., The Little Mermaid.","17 March 2022",9,0,3
"Turning Red","It's an ok movie. I didn't really like the story, but the animation is good and it's funny.

Far from being the worst Pixar movie, but it's also far from being the best. As some have said, it's forgettable.","31 March 2022",7,0,2
"Turning Red","The movie is emotional, energetic, overall just a blast to watch! Seeing it taking place in 2002 was an interesting choice to do and seeing all the callbacks to a previous culture was very reminiscent.","25 March 2022",8,2,6
"Turning Red","This movie is almost exactly what it was like being in your early teens, as a girl in Canada in the early 2000s. I could not believe how similar everything (except turning into a panda) was to my/my friends experiences! I LOVED the boy band obsession. People saying this isn't realistic are so far removed from life, its insane. The relationship between Mei and Ming was/is great, and the growth of both characters and their respect for each other is so touching. ❤❤","14 March 2022",9,2,9
"Turning Red","This moving tells the story of a young girl finding her identity as a teenager while she struggles with expectations places on her.

The movie has fun with the topic and, although it is written from a Chinese-Canadian perspective, it could apply just as easily to any teen.

Some reviews here seem to criticize the movie's asian perspective and the diversity of the cast (one referenced too many turbans and hijabs). In fact, this movie quite accurately reflects the diversity of Toronto and, in many ways simply reflects life in Toronto.

In my opinion, the heart of the story is universal and can apply in any culture.","14 March 2022",9,2,5
"Turning Red","Yea... so the description of -- A 13-year-old girl named Meilin turns into a giant red panda whenever she gets too excited -- is a really dumbed down version of what the movie is all about. It's about girls getting their period and all the emotions that come with it. It's great if your a male and have daughters and don't understand what your up against. Not a pice for kids though so weird of Pixar to choose this as a topic.","13 March 2022",5,2,4
"Turning Red","A story about self-control, acceptance, identity, and emotions. That I did not expect to be as deep as it was. I was more so expecting a goofy magical animal film.

Pixar never fails to make a good movie, this for sure is a very specific topic and theme. But the way it's presented and displayed is very well done. (for the most part) The film has some messy parts but not enough to pick them out for me personally. I feel most people can relate to some of the themes of growing up here, even if you aren't a teenage girl.

I like the themes of family expectations, and how sometimes, bonds and friendships can be stronger than blood and family.","15 March 2022",8,0,2
"Turning Red","So many boring and closed off people in this Country (US). Great animation, fun songs, whole family loved it! Karen's are worried that the brainwashing they are doing to their kids might be challenged. Heavens no!! But, they don't see the irony in this flick I'm sure. Grab some popcorn and just relax and maybe, just maybe you'll crack a smile. Side note: LOOOOVE seeing a Type 1 in this film. Not usually represented, but glad there was a little cameo.","14 March 2022",8,2,13
"Turning Red","This movie takes some risks in the way it explores some themes but the way it depicts relatable preteen struggles makes it a recommended watch for anyone. The movie does not shy away from the cringe inducing thoughts we all had as hound teens. Instead it normalizes these things in a way that is comforting and allows for self acceptance the same way the main character finds acceptance.

The main criticism would be underdeveloped relationships between other family members but as friendship was one of the main focuses this can be somewhat overlooked.","14 March 2022",9,2,5
"Turning Red","It's so good. I love the color pallet used throughout the movie. It's so beautiful and comfortable to watch. I'm surprised with the 90s setting that gives a bag of sweet memories for us who shared similar experience with Mei. A feel good movie!","26 June 2022",9,1,5
"Turning Red","I really wanted to like this, but the side characters are all so annoying. I was a teenage girl not long ago yet I still found the main character to be completely unrelatable and uninteresting. I'm just going to go watch Encanto for the 100th time.","15 April 2022",3,1,3
"Turning Red","I saw Turning Red with my six year old daughter and really enjoyed it. It's not a flashy movie by any means but it has some good family-themed messages that really resonated with me, The film's premise is very simple. There is a long held family secret about the spirit of a red panda that suddenly comes to dominate the life of a 13 year old Canadian-Chinese girl named Meilin. However, the movie is more than just about how a mystical panda turns everyone's life upside down.

What intrigues me most about this film is the dynamic between Meilin and her mother and the cultural backdrop in which their relationship plays out. Meilin is a typical 13 year old going through the growing pains of early adolescence. It's an awkward age for anyone, but it's particularly difficult for a young girl like Meilin who is trying to forge an identity which conflicts with the values of the traditional Chinese culture in which she is reared.

I vividly recall students like Meilin from my own school experiences. They always topped the class rankings and virtually all of them were admitted into the prestigious college of their choice. Nothing less than perfection was expected of them from their ambitious families and any deviation from their life's plan was considered sacrilegious and dishonorable. It's interesting how many of these former classmates with whom I've run into later in life have come to regret not having made more time in adolescence for personal exploration and fun, and it's precisely Meilin's inner-conflict between following her heart and living up to her family''s expectations which lies at the heart of her personal dilemma.

I don't think I'm providing any spoilers by referencing the movie's main plot line involving Meilin's ability to transform from human to red panda, as this plot point is readily given away in all the film's trailers and previews. In my view, this plot point is more than just a device to keep the story going. I think the director uses the 'red panda' as a metaphor to represent all the incomplete parts of ourselves-both good and bad-that swirl beneath our surface and that are always fighting to get out.

This film not only teaches children about the travails of early adolescence, but it also illustrates the suddenness of how life can force us to make important choices at a moment's notice. Meilin, with the support of those who care about her, ultimately makes those choices and becomes a more whole person because of it. She learns that good and bad reside within each of us and that the best navigational instrument to sail through these choppy waters is to stay true to yourself.

Turning Red is a nice coming of age movie filled with important life lessons that the entire family can enjoy. Check it out. You'll be glad you did.","29 March 2022",7,1,4
"Turning Red","It is great to see pictures of many kids that were invisible for decades. Great metaphor for girls entering puberty. Yet ignorance and intolerance can be read in a lot of the comments of sensitive entitled people that get their feelings hurt because their race is not at the front and center of every story.","13 March 2022",7,1,6
"Turning Red","It's a non-hypocritical movie about growing up and puberty. People may be akward talking about hormonal changes during the beginning of puberty, but not talking is a problem. This movie goes over this problem and gets people who feel ashamed to talk about having to deal with that feeling.","13 March 2022",9,1,2
"Turning Red","In the latest Disney and Pixar hit directed by Domee Shi and produced by Lindsey Collins, Turning Red, a young girl called Meilin 'Mei' Lee (Rosalie Chiang) falls prey to a family curse - or is it a blessing? - that turns her into a giant red panda at moments of high emotion. When her mother Ming (Sandra Oh) tries to get rid of the panda, Mei must decide whether to accept the beast inside her, or reject it in order to truly come of age.

With its chunky-cute styling inspired by anime and other Asian influences, Turning Red shows us a side of Pixar we have not seen before. The fluid camerawork penetrates a series of beautifully designed spaces, bringing a unique perspective to a diverse cast of complex and lovable characters. At the same time, like so many Pixar movies before it, Turning Red also has the courage to tackle bold themes.

The first of these is perfectionism. Mei's mother is a control freak, but in reality her obsession with perfection hides a deep fragility. Like most perfectionists, the person Ming is most critical of is herself. As for Mei, she spends much of the film trying to find her own identity while at the same time mimicking elements of her mother's behavior. ""Some of her moves are also my moves,"" she says. In a delicate way this shows how kids emulate their parents' behavior.

At the film's emotional climax Ming finally acknowledges the hard truth by admitting her mistakes and apologizing to her daughter: ""You want to make everyone happy but you are so hard on yourself. I am sorry if I taught you that."" She eventually finds words to express her deep love for her daughter and to let her go: ""Don't hold back for anyone. The farther you'll go the prouder I'll be.""

This message takes on special meaning in contemporary society. Obsessed with perfection, young people are constantly bombarded with idealized representations of themselves through media in general, and social media in particular. It takes courage to represent things the way they are and not as we would like them to be - even if that means embracing complexity and pain - and this something Pixar has always done so well: turning the light onto difficult questions in a very philosophical, yet accessible way.

Ming is also profoundly aware of her role as an Chinese immigrant in Toronto. As part of her daily routine she gives tours of the Chinese temple, opening up her culture to her neighbors and in turn to the global movie-going audience watching Turning Red on Disney+. In this way the filmmakers bring depth to the immigrant story by infusing it with rich layers of tradition, transforming the film into an open invitation for the world to open its eyes to Chinese culture, to analyze it, criticize it, and ultimately accept it.

However, the true power of Turning Red lies in its celebration of menstruation. By transforming this everyday reality into something divine, the story revisits the myth of Persephone, with Mei as the embodiment of the goddess. It challenges all those traditions by which women are excluded from temples and other sacred spaces because of their 'impure bodies.'

Indeed transformation lies at the heart of Turning Red - this is a coming-of-age story, an intensely female bildungsroman. Nowhere is the theme of transformation tackled more compassionately than in the sequences set in the bamboo forest, the sacred dimension where Mei confronts the circular portal through which she must pass if she wants to rid herself of her red panda alter-ego.

The domain of the goddess Sun Yee, the bamboo forest is visually enchanting. Its soothing green beauty provides the perfect backdrop from which these tiny human characters contemplate the immensity of the cosmos. The truth it embodies is as old as the world - the knowledge that the time must come when you break away from all you have known to become your own person and accept yourself. To grow up. This is what Mei's mother, with her stern, non-negotiable ideals, is urging her daughter to do by rejecting the panda that lives inside her.

If only it were so easy. Like Ovid, the poet of the metamorphoses, the fleeting world that connects humans, gods and beasts, Mei understands the power of ambiguity. She knows that discarding the panda means denying her innate power of creativity and all that is wild. The challenge for Mei - as for every human being who ever drew breath - is to achieve the transformation from child to adult without rejecting the good savage in her soul. As the setting for this rite of passage, the bamboo forest is therefore a space dedicated to the forces of nature and transformation. It reminds us that, with her devotion to all things ecological, Mei is the embodiment of Sun Yee in the modern world.

The device through which transformation is achieved is the circular magic portal that exists amid the bamboo shoots. In Chinese culture - as in so many cultures around the world -the circle represents infinity. The use of a circle as a visual metaphor for coming-of-age reminded me powerfully of the circular dance at the end of Federico Fellini's 8½, or the moment in The Catcher in the Rye when Holden Caulfield finally conquers his fear of getting old by joining his sister Phoebe on the carousel. The circle also symbolizes repetition and rebirth. Only when Mei finds Ming restored to youth in the bamboo forest does she finally understand her mother. In this heart-wrenching scene, she achieves the empathy that we then share as the movie-going audience.

The magic portal's liquid surface gives it additional symbolic qualities. Water represents both life and femininity, and the portal's mirror-like quality is a memorable example of the way the film plays with reflections. When Grandma (Wai Ching Ho) first arrives at the temple we see Mei reflected in her glasses. Mei constantly sees herself through the eyes of others, and she talks to herself in the mirror whenever she is engaged in some great internal debate. The idea of reflection comes full circle when Mei finally accepts herself for who she is - she literally learns to see herself and to accept her true self.

During the red panda ritual, when all the women gather in a circle to invoke the power of Sun Yee, this geometric perfection unites ancient tradition with the modern world. The circle's powerful presence dominates the film's spectacular final act, when all the main characters converge at a rock concert being given by the boy band 4*Town. A visual tour de force, the concert positions Mei firmly at the junction of old and new, illustrated by the blending of traditional Chinese singing and 4*Town's pop music, a magical alignment that brings to mind Bruce Chatwin's book The Songlines, which explores the way in which aboriginal people sing the world into creation, making meaning through their voices.

For all the film's depth and complexity, it is also a wonderful opportunity for Pixar to indulge in its playful side and dial up the humor. There are lots of Easter eggs here to please the fans - I spotted a fish that looked suspiciously like Nemo lurking in a koi carp pond, and the rabbit from Burrowadorns Mei's notepad. Meanwhile the recurring images of dumplings surely allude to Domee Shi's animated short film Bao.

Indeed, the filmmakers' love of cinema is clear throughout the film. There are plentiful references to Isao Takahata and Hayao Miyazaki, the Japanese masters of animation, with echoes of the bamboo forest from The Tale of Princess Kaguya and the shape-shifting Japanese raccoon dogs from Pom Poko. When the kids are excited their eyes enlarge like the eyes of anime characters, and when Ming transforms into a gigantic kaiju-panda and gatecrashes the concert, we understand why Grandma had announced the arrival of 'Mingzilla.'

The overall cinematic language is remarkably beautiful, especially when it comes to the film's use of color. The story takes place in the spring, giving the filmmakers ample scope to paint the landscapes in glorious hues of feminine pink and purple. We see flowers everywhere, both growing and represented in fabric.

Most important of all, of course, is the color red. Not only is red a symbol of passion and menstruation but also - as Mei's father points out - of good fortune in Chinese culture. Mei's red shoes and red pin show her allegiance to this color, but she wears a green pin too - the color preferred by Ming and Miryam who wear green clothing and shoes. If Mei is Persephone then it would follow that Ming is Demeter, the goddess of the harvest. Just as Persephone defied her mother by eating the red pomegranate seeds, so Mei defied her mother by going to the concert.

As for the film's ultimate message - to find this we need look no further than the title, Turning Red. In the English language to 'turn' is also to change. Seasons turn, years turn and, as the Americans say, whole lives can turn on a dime. This truly is a story built on the power of transformation, a story that invites every audience member to look at themselves in the mirror and wonder: ""What animal do I secretly carry inside?"" Following the Shamanistic dimension of this story, this is indeed a fundamental question for all of us.","21 April 2022",10,0,1
"Turning Red","As a 90's baby who is now a mom to a preteen; I loved it! Is it about a young girl coming of age that is a little rebellious?

I don't think it ""encourages"" kids to rebel against their parents but rather teaches kids that it's ok to be your own person while still making your parents proud. I loved that nostalgia of the tamagotchi and the boy band. I also loved that the main character wasn't the typical societal standard of beauty but a cute, straight A student, nerdy girl.","30 March 2022",8,1,4
"Turning Red","Saw a bunch of kids complaining about the movie being bad. Sorry to break it to you but the world doesn't revolve around you. Just turn it off and leave and go watch something else. The rest of us who have actually finished 6th grade are fine enjoying this movie by ourselves.","9 June 2022",9,0,4
"Turning Red","Turning Red humorously tears down a taboo barrier using a vibrant and brilliant analogy on female puberty that American filmmakers rarley tackle in a kid's movie.

For the modern family audience Turning Red will be the go to movie for parents and their young daughters on the journey to womanhood.","12 March 2022",8,0,2
"Turning Red","This 30 something had a blast while enjoying this movie with 2 small children, 7 and 5. It's a beautiful and subtle coming of age story about the many changes and emotions teenage girls go through. It's witty and relatable, it has super funny references that a lot of parents are sure to enjoy, too.","17 March 2022",9,1,7
"Turning Red","Good movie for all ages and all can enjoy it together, it shows friends, family , choices, tears , smile all are part of us, very good movie .

I enjoyed it so much, some childhood memories getting alive while watching this.","18 March 2022",10,2,5
"Turning Red","The movie does a fine job with exploring another round of generational trauma from a ""Asian American POV"", which is nice. The father character was really funny and nice, and the mother is a fair antagonist with understandable motives. I kind of got what the protagonist was going with and her goal to see a concert. I liked the whole BTS parody called 4town. The 4 friends fangirling about it was realistic, and dare I say, amusing. The whole concept of Mei Lin (protagonist) running away and lying under her mother's watch is because she feels too much pressure, and I thought that was an accurate moment. Now for the elephant in the room: Mei Lin turning into a red panda is a fun concept with her thinking her life is ruined. I liked the story where Mei Lin tries to raise money to get tickets to a 4town concert, despite her mother's disapproval. The grandmother's role to attend the ritual to ""cure"" Mei Lin was kind of hilarious. A lot of Asian American gags were fun too (and the Timbits cameo).

When Mei Lin runs from home to escape to the 4town concert (ditching the ritual), her mother becomes mad, and she becomes a red panda too. Except she is like, godzilla levels of huge. This is where the movie falls a bit, because I found it quite odd how the grandmother was Mei Lin's size in red panda form. I thought the ending was nice; it was bold for Mei Lin to refuse the ritual cure to become ""normal"" again, which shows how much she has changed (and later turns out it was a good decision because it does wonders for the temple the family runs). However, I found the falling action to be quite undeserving: A huge fine from the city is good, but not enough. Some 4town fan must have definitely died during the climax scene and the family just goes off with a fine? Because the movie takes place in modern Toronto, I would expect the military to fly in and carry an operation, hell we don't even see any police officers on the scene. If I was the mayor, seeing my city getting stomped by a giant creature, I would immediately order an airstrike, or some kind of military support. It's a brutal ending, but would be more deserving and would make sense.

Also just a nitpick, but it was a missed opportunity to put Mel Latchman in the movie, (Mayor of Toronto in 2002), it would have helped reinforce the timeline the movie was in.","13 March 2022",7,0,2
"Turning Red","I enjoyed this movie well enough and I think it's a fun movie for most families, it just lacks some of the magic that a Pixar movie has the potential to provide. I feel like a lot of the main characters could get a little too annoying for my taste, and that some areas of the movie dragged a little too much. On the plus side, the animation was great, the concept was really interesting and well executed, and the humor was done well. Overall, I'm glad I watched this on Disney+ rather than going to see it I'm theaters.","11 April 2022",7,0,0
"Turning Red","I saw the movie on release and it was awesome! It has funny quotes, cool stunts, many scenes that makes you say ""Hey, who left these bowl of onions here?"", amazing voice acting, and catchy songs! I wish I could watch it again and again and again. In the end, (didn't mean to offend the last Disney movie) it was way better since Encanto.","14 June 2022",10,1,5
"Turning Red","Story was bleh. Music was bleh. Characters were bleh. Humour was meh.

I don't know who wrote this pile of poop, but it just felt off as a coming-of-age film, and the lack of decent characterization didn't help any.","7 August 2022",2,0,4
"Turning Red","I,m a 49 years old male thats writing this review. The movie seems more aimed at teenage girls over anything but when i watched it with our 12-15 years old kids even them lost interrest after a while.

Younger kids may love the panda itself and its cute alright but so young kids may not know about pubertal life yet, especially not boys.

The 4 town was so obviously groups like. One Direction or such group, so why not just call them what they are well known as.","2 April 2022",2,0,1
"Turning Red","It's cute but predictable. Common theme with Disney/Pixar when it comes their films; kids and their parents.

Anyways, I wouldn't want to watch again buy my 12 year old son enjoyed it.","20 March 2022",6,0,3
"Turning Red","So I didn't really know what to expect from this movie. I didn't liked the trailers or the Promotional ads very much and thought this was going to be another High School Diaries kinda story. But after watching it I'm happy to report that it was GREAT!!! And I was impressed. Set in Toronto , Canada in 2002, Turning Red is a funny and Heartwarming tale of a 13 year old girl named Mei who is torn between her responsibility of being her mother's dutiful daughter and the chaos of adolescence. There are so many great elements in this movie like the discussion of periods and pads that all women go through. The mother-daughter relationship between Mei and her mother Ming is really Heartwarming and as Mei's relationship with her friends and the use of Chinese culture and the lore behind the Red Panda thing. Another thing that I really liked about this movie is that it has more diverse characters , not just ethnically but also in their designs and personalities , than other Pixar movies and the exploration of Asian Family Dynamics. Domee Shi made an incredible feature directorial debut with this movie and I'm for what she has next. It's definitely worth a watch. Also , this is to keep in mind that this is a more mature Pixar movie about growing up and sometimes maybe not be suitable for small kids. I would recommend this for children of ages 10+","12 March 2022",9,0,3
"Turning Red","A lot of people will give a movie one star just to bring the score of a movie down, they don't really think it's a one star movie but they want to correct the balance. This isn't one of those movies. This is a one star movie one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life.

I went into this movie not knowing what to except the trailers where rather annoying but it could possibly pull through a decent viewing, boy was I wrong. The movie while short felt like an eternity of annoying characters lackluster animation bland world uninteresting plot and some of the most unlikable characters ever put to film. Their was a lot wrong with this film the biggest being that I didn't like a single character well I guess the dad was ok but that's as good as it gets the dad who is barley in the film and has two lines is the best character every other character is either a shallow a**hole or a over the top b*tch.","22 April 2022",1,4,12
"Turning Red","The concept is fun, but they just used to the ""be yourself"" which at the end I just don't get the point where Pixar were trying to go. The plot it's extremely predictable and the characters relationships like mother and son would work with the final part but didn't cause there's like nothing of their true bond in the movie. It os cringy but at least laughable, just wish pixar put a little more effort in this kinda movies, luca went well but this is just average.","16 March 2022",6,1,2
"Turning Red","Watched this with a friend. This was so relatable! Reminiscent of our first periods, even if we didn't turn into red pandas. The untruthful ""I'm totally ok"", the ""why is this happening??"" meltdowns, crushing on NSync-like boy-bands (Back Street Boys?), the boy I fought so much with that we became great friends as a result.

It's great that Pixar makes movies for both kids and adults, with lessons usually for the kids. But I think the main lesson here was meant for the adults, which is probably lost on a lot of the audience. It doesn't matter if you're a mother or father, or whether you have a girl or a boy going through adolescence - you gotta let them be who the want and like what they want, and BACK OFF! We can't be doing these things to our kids. When they get crushes, when they discover their feelings, they're going to do what they're going to do - exactly what we did, in fact, and we can't stop it. The only wrong-doing was done by the mom. The kid was battling between staying a compliant little girl (something impossible to do for her entire life, physically and biologically, even though she herself wanted that) and growing up and pursuing her own interests. Being ""good"" was bad because it meant staying a little girl forever, which is impossible. The mom set her up for failure, she wouldn't let her follow her natural instincts, so the kid was compelled to lie, compelled to be defiant in order to fulfill her biological and intellectual growth needs. The person who needed to change her perspective was the mom, which she did, but how often in real life does that not happen and that ruins parent-child relationships.

And the conversation between the kid and the mom at the end was so poignant - ""you're so hard on yourself, and if I made you do that, I'm sorry"". That deserves a 10/10 right there.

So that's my take. It's a great lesson, but it's aimed at the people (parents, both mothers and fathers) who don't necessarily like to swallow that pill.","6 September 2022",10,1,3
"Turning Red","A beautiful movie with great animation at first, I was not excited about the movie, but when I finished watching it, the story of the movie seemed a little strange, but I liked the movie very much. The music was beautiful, not exaggerated, but it was light in the scenes, especially at the end. One of the parts of the movie that I liked the most. The end was the animation. The music was beautiful and the scenes were perfect, which made me admire the movie more.","14 March 2022",8,1,5
"Turning Red","This movie tackles anger management, menstruation, helicopter parenting, and teen angst in a great adventure. Here are the family member scores:

"Turning Red","Normally don't write reviews but after reading some of the comments about the movie on twitter and also being from Toronto I decided to give it a shot. Bit of a disappointment, previous Pixar movies did a fantastic job and entertaining the kids while keeping the adults fully engaged. This just didn't do it. Felt more like a Saturday morning cartoon than a serious effort by Pixar. Hopefully the next outing will hit home. Oh andI read that online review that everyone trashed, guess I'm just out of touch with current feelings as I saw nothing racist about it.","13 March 2022",5,0,2
"Turning Red","I won't rate as this movie is not designed for people like me.

I personally couldn't stand it and found the main protagonist annoying as all hell.

But my 8 year old daughter really enjoyed it. And that's the point movies don't have to be for everyone. There are many who will get this movie, love it and watch with their daughters.

So if you watch this and it's not for you, feel free to leave it but don't deny others the joy of it. It is not a typical Pixar movie, it is not universal in appeal. But that is a sign of growth not stagnation.","19 March 2022",,0,4
"Turning Red","The animation is pretty sick and i was not expecting for the story to be all that substantial, but it made me eat my own words.

"Turning Red","The movie has a lot of propoganda on inclusiveness which should be taught at school and not at a movie theatre in my opinion.

The story is great.

Watched it with my little sister.

Feels somewhat close to Hulk.

Good message in the end for kids in the US but not for kids from India.","11 March 2022",8,3,38
"Turning Red","Listen. Turning Red is an absolute gem of a movie that deserves all the love it should get. While yes, there is the obvious metaphor of going through puberty, it is more than that. It is about being young and that time when you are first discovering who you really are but are too afraid to show that side of yourself due to strict upbrings or overbearing parents. Not only that, it beautifully captures the spirit of what it was like being a kid/preteen who is loud and messy at times, gets excited about the things they love and are passionate about, and just wants to hang out with their friends and have fun. For those who completely missed the point of the film or are just ""too cool"" to admit they were once young kids who could be cringy and emotional at times is saddening.","9 June 2022",10,2,5
"Turning Red","Me and and my husband absolutely loved this movie!

Cute, funny, and totally relatable!

It was especially touching to me because I've lived in China for 6 years and my husband is Chinese.

Thank you Pixar for making this movie, haven't enjoyed an animation movie for quite a long time.","17 June 2022",10,2,5
"Turning Red","Simple story with meaningful lesson. I'm really in love with every character and love the friendship too. The character development from every character are so touching, especially Mei-Mei. This movie is make me cry in the end of the movie. Such a masterpiece for an animation movie. I hope to see more movie like this.","18 June 2022",10,2,5
"Turning Red","My attention have been caught since the very first look on cute red panda. Fluffy cuteness. But behind all fur- the girl who is craving for freedom and to be seen for who she really is. Long months of waiting is out - let's see how the beautiful concept works.

Of course I would like to mention the director, the women has taken fart in making of animation pictures for Pixar. Those will inevitably make you cry of true. This time included. Pack of tissues went empty during watching, but there was loads of laughing though. I would call it a rather balanced creature made of teenage experience.

Following to VFx - masterpiece itself. Magic was shown truly wholesome, the choices of cinematographers are elegant and make you think about sense of a picture twice.

Actors have made their tasks up professionally, deliciously to watch. Each emotion was felt as sharp as never. Talking about characters, there is some questions to the attitude of main character's friends - but those are kids, confused by becoming adults just as me and you were. The picture make teens let go off many fears and shows that to become yourself you need to get rid off layers gained from social circle of family and see who you want to be.

I grew to be a fan of it. If there would be voting about making next films of that sort - yes, I would enjoy to watch film showing up interesting and magnificently made legend of all nations around a world. I will also be amused to see this same movie again.","17 January 2023",7,0,0
"Turning Red","Enjoyed watching movie ... kids liked it and we also enjoyed. Character has been well designed. It's a soft story which needs to be taken care smoothly and director did the job well.","29 March 2022",10,1,5
"Turning Red","People are crazy on here. Honestly, just because a character is Asian or female and you happen to not be, that doesn't mean there's nothing for you to relate to.

Did you have crushes when you were in middle school? Stuff you were a fan of, or really excited about? Did you have embarrassing moments? Did you have to figure out your relationship with your family now that you weren't a kid anymore? Was some of that hard, even though you love em?

I honestly can't believe people would be so, I don't know, limited on any level to look at the demographics and say, ""not meant for me."" That's just crazy. I know all kinds of people same demo as me, white straight male, and none of them are like that. So I'm going to go ahead and blame the negative reviews on a Russian troll farm, or the occasional, unhappy, far right rabbit hole tripper.

IMHO, the great Pixar movies are: Ratatouille, Incredibles, Finding Nemo, and Wall-e. This is right up there with em.","5 July 2022",10,2,5
"Turning Red","Let's face it, the movie has an underlying story - periods. Big shock horror, most young women have to go through this. What's wrong with it being referenced in a film aimed at girls?

I thought the story was very reminiscent for many girls that grew up in the 90s.

Yes it's predictable. But it's fun. And ultimately a reminder that as good as it is to love and respect your family, you also need to care about you.

Watch and enjoy 😊","19 March 2022",8,0,3
"Turning Red","We asked Aleksa what he liked about this movie. His honest answer was ""Everything"".

"Turning Red","Being someone who has lived in Toronto my whole life, it feels like they decided to say it's set in Toronto, slap the CN Tower into skyline views, show some TTC streetcars and call it a day. Nowhere do we have cherry blossom trees just lining the street. Also all the apparel and accessories to try and make it look ""Canadian"" is just done tastelessly and way over the top.

These issues with location distracted me too much from anything that was going on in this film.","14 March 2022",5,3,9
"Turning Red","I found Turning Red to be Pixar's best film in the Disney+ era. Soul is beautifully rendered and some shots contain their best animation to date, but it's abstract and hard to relate to. Onward has a good message but fails to make use of its fantasy setting, it literally could have been about human characters and nothing about the movie would change. Luca... well, it's a film.

So it didn't need much for Turning Red to clear the low bar set for it, and it's genuinely funny in moments. At first it can be a little confusing because you're not sure if what you're seeing is actually happening or if it's something in Mei's imagination. Mei's mother publicly humiliates her no less than 4 times in the film, so for a film that's very open about positive representation it still leans into 'older Asian women are pretty mean' stereotype pretty comfortably.

The plot hook (turning into a Panda) is more woven into the story and less of an afterthought than what Luca's turning-into-a-fish plot hook was, which is a positive since the marketing made it seem that turning into a big red monster was nothing more than a super-obvious period allegory. It also manages not to fall into the trap of using every Panda scene to be a metaphor for *something*.

Here's where Turning Red falls short of being top-tier Pixar: take a movie like Inside Out (probably in their Top 5); imagine if that film made Riley the A-story and her emotions the B-story. Everything is the same except everything is told from Riley's POV and her emotions are given cutaways like an episode of Lizzy McGuire. It wouldn't be the same movie, because while Riley's emotions are unique to her they are shown to be universal among all people and you find your relatability in the personification of the emotions. If the story were about Riley it would be limited.

Turning Red focuses so much on Mei and puts so much emphasis about growing up in the Asian community in Toronto that it feels like it's going to mean more to a very specific audience. I didn't feel left out watching it, I don't have to identify with the characters on screen, but I also feel I didn't get half the references the film wanted me to pick up on.","17 March 2022",7,0,5
"Turning Red","I feel that this was an absolutely remarkable and amazing film! I'm glad a woman directed this, it is obvious because the preteen girls (and boys) are FAR more realistic than I am used to them being portrayed. I appreciated how real and accepting it is, including aspects like fanfiction and first-period experiences. It really brings a positive light to that stuff and does not shame teen girls for being just that -- teen girls.

I have seen a lot of hate toward this film which I don't quite understand, because Disney/Pixar have made terrible movies before and this is FAR from being one of them. I love the animation style as it is beautiful, colorful, and very fun to watch. The background/art style was mesmerizing and colorful. The soundtrack was catchy and hit home. I feel this movie is what we needed!","13 March 2022",10,3,11
"Turning Red","I went in to this movie with fairly low expectations since I don't really like coming of age stories but I was pleasantly surprised over how good the movie was. The characters were well written and the puberty-metaphor of turning in to a giant red panda is weird for sure, but still a quite fun one and it was executed well. The animation is good (though not as technically impressive as Pixar movies like you story 4 and cars 3). It has a clear visual style that it sticks to and it looks really nice.

This movie however was one of the most painful experiences I've had consuming any form of media. I would describe it as a sort of inverted Seinfeld effect where as instead of being somewhat relatable though exaggerated and presented in a mainly comedic manner, this film is very relatable though exaggerated and whilst comedic, it is mainly supposed to make you feel uncomfortable. As quite the young lad myself (16) I didn't have that much distance to the time when I too was 13 and that made the movie sometimes very hard to watch.

All and all though the movie is very good with fleshed out and (mostly) likable characters (my favorite was the dad) and good voice acting. I heard some people complain that this movie isn't suitable for kids and while that is true to an extent, that's nothing that I hold against it. I'd be willing to wager the target demographic the creators had in mind were kids in their early teens which isn't anything negative by any means, though it can be worth taking into consideration if you plan on watching it with your kids (if they're under 9-10 you are probably better off watching Toy Story, Cars, Nemo or Inside Out).

After not being overly impressed with Luca I thought this was a really good comeback for Pixar and I really recommend you to watch it if it sounds interesting to you.","12 March 2022",8,0,2
"Turning Red","I really apprecciated the way this Pixar movie has been able to represent how hard it is to accept their daughter's changement for parents and what it means for a young girl to undergo the weird process of aging.

In my opinion Mai's transformation into a red panda can be seen as a metaphor to describe how you feel in such a difficult moment, in which you can perceive that you are mutating into someone different from your parents' desires and your body is changing as well. It becomes unrecognisable and your only whish is to hide it. Probably for a boy is different but as a woman, who had experienced this transformation a long time ago, I can perfectly relate to Mai's feelings.

Let me add one more thing: after all these years of disney (dream works, etc.) princesses with their beautiful aspect and their overwhelming love dramas, we did really need of something that could make clear that, at a certain point, as a girl you change, your body changes and you should not feel ashamed. On the contrary, you should be proud and be ready to face the world (and even change your mind, without any fear).","14 March 2022",,4,13
"Turning Red","I feel like the only ones praising this movie are adults who liked it. It's not a movie for kids at all. We had to shut it off not long into the movie because it was not appropriate for my 2 and 7 year old. Maybe 13 and up. But even still the disrespect to parents, lying and sneaking out of the house alone would keep me from letting my teen from watching it. Saying that those behaviors are typical amongst teens is not true and showing them they can do those things and not get in trouble is a bad example. There were zero consequences for the girls actions. Maybe her mom was too controlling at times, but that doesn't justify the behaviors of the child and the lack of consequences.","13 January 2023",1,1,3
"Turning Red","Synopsis: A 13 year old girls life is thrown into disarray when a family curse presents itself whenever she gets overexcited. It's not just any curse, it turns her into a red panda. Will she embrace this side to her or will she try to abandon it? A hard decision awaits her.

Story 4/5: The premise of this movie really caught my attention as Pixar usually use a simple premise and crank it up to 11 with emotional weight and great humour. I can say with absolute delight, that this movie has both. It tells a captivating coming of age story which is timeless in itself with a great main character who is flawed (Even though she wouldn't think that) with some truly amazing side characters. The story has charm, inspiration and a moral that will keep children and adults entertained throughout. Genuinely, I believe that the personification of growing up as being a red panda in this movie is inspired and very appropriate regarding the ethnicity of the character. This makes it a multi-faceted important story to tell with great use of different cultural characters from around the world.

Acting 4/5: Overall, the voice talent in this movie is great with its main character, Meilin, being voiced by an Asian actor, Rosalie Chiang. This is Rosalie Chiang's first big movie and I am impressed with the personality she put into the the character. As mentioned earlier, this is one of the most culturally diverse cast including Sandra Oh (Killing Eve, Raya and the Last Dragon) and Maitreyi Ramakrishnan (Never Have I Ever) who also gives brilliant voice work. The movie is fast paced and the actors voice work had to be engaging for this movie to work, and that is exactly what it was, a brilliant showcase in how voice work should be done in an animation. This is another win in Pixar's book of achievements.

Visuals 5/5: Honestly Pixar always have killer animation and this is no exception. First of all, the colours pop and are engaging and the character movements are fluid and poppy. They use character movements that are sudden, almost likening it to what anime does with its animation. With Meilin, you can see individual hairs moving which shows how far animation has come, especially in regards to Pixar's earlier works like Toy Story and Monsters inc. Genuinely, this movie was a delight for the eyes and is a showcase on the things that can be done with animation today.

Editing 4/5: As mentioned previously, the visuals of this movie really stood out as being different and I believe that is due to the inspirations the filmmakers took into account. With this in mind, the movie was fast-paced, interesting and had creative cutaways which pushed the story forward. They implemented a style that has been done before but it was masterfully used here with a pinch of Pixar flair.

Sound 3/5: Composed by Ludwig Göransson, the original soundtrack was used to great affect but it is overshadowed by the 4 town music (so catchy) but unfortunately they didn't use as much cultural music as I would have expected, especially with the cultural aspects of the movie being prevalent.

In summary, this is a great animated movie with some stunning visuals, brilliant voice work and a style that Pixar has never done before which shows how much passion has been put into their work. For me, this is another win by the amazing team at Pixar!","14 March 2022",8,0,2
"Turning Red","Pixar has always been a top-quality animation studio known for its ability to tell stories that both children and their parents love. I saw the movie with my 13 year old niece and it left us very indifferent. The main character and the boy band story bored us to death. But I don't want to list what we didn't like.

Perhaps the only interesting thing was to see how they visualize the Asian culture, where a disturbing over-pressure is put on the children to make them stand out among millions of other kids just like them.

Also, how the family is an intergenerational yoke, for better or worse, that is difficult to get out of.","13 March 2022",2,2,5
"Turning Red","This movie is brilliant in many ways. The story, the plot, it's original. The fact that this is one of the best magical stories from pixar since Coco, and Soul and they did it amazing. Creating a story about a puberty with such a cute symbol and animation is very unique. And please don't bring under kids like 5-7 to this movie because this movie is talking about periods or crushes and some mature stuff, its targetted for 14+ audience and i think it's a good thing Pixar did that, being mature with their stories but keeping up the pixar magic and creative stories, even if it is animated movie it doesn't have to be suitable with children. And also this movie get so much hate even before the movie came out, a lot of people bashing it on the twitter but eventually it got some positive reviews aswell which i appreciate about it. Sure the animation is different compared to what Pixar has made back then but we need diverse animation, and Turning Red delivers colorful colors and stunning visual with the standards of Pixar as usual. It's a really good movie that sadly went to streaming services.. Please respect this movie and this movie doesn't deserved the many hates it gets. Go Turning Red and Go pixar!","15 March 2022",10,1,2
"Turning Red","As someone who had a short fuse as a teen, the red panda theme really hit home for me. Seeing as how I've never found closure about my own problems regarding my Asian upbringing, my own rage issues and the tween/teen girl aesthetic being mocked still, it honestly was an unexpectedly cathartic experience for me. I bawled my goddamn eyes out. This is going to be one of the classics, I'd bet.

And so for these very personal reasons, I'm giving it a full score.

If for some irrelevant reasons like it not looking exactly like your home street in Toronto made you feel like this is not the movie for you, well it probably is not. Canada served as a good background for the movie, but honestly the country/premise really didn't matter here. This is pretty much a universal movie I'd say, dedicated to all the high strung kids who don't have an outlet. What's not to like?","11 March 2022",10,2,7
"Turning Red","I understand this is supposed to be a coming of age story.... But the way this movie promoted disobeying parents/family really sat wrong with me while I was watching it with my 5 year old daughter. To constantly have a main character that flat out disobeys her parents over and over again (even to the point of sneaking out to go to a party at a boys house... AT 13 YEARS OLD) just didn't seem like a great example for my young daughter to watch. And unfortunately that wasn't the only stuff that happened that was upsetting. Something else that occurred is a 13 Year old girl says her parents don't like her music because it's 'Stripper music' ... ummm... HELLO?! My jaw about hit the floor. Is this a DISNEY movie that is mentioning STRIPPER MUSIC? YUPPP! I understand it's supposed to be funny.. but it just seemed very out of place/random/inappropriate for a Disney movie. Again, I know it's a coming of age story... but the boy obsession throughout was just very over the top for my 5 year old. It was insane. It's alllll the girls talk about. From boy band obsession, spying on 'attractive boys' and even cat calling boys from the bleachers... I just feel like lots of this would have been more appropriate for a teenage level movie. The main character even referred to some drawings she had drawn as 'sexy drawings...' again.... Did Disney really green light this?","15 March 2022",4,1,2
"Turning Red","I did not get the message of this movie until about half way through. And when I did I thought this was pretty clever to take the subject matter and bring it into a cartoon/Pixar movie. Thought it was very good for adolescences going into puberty. This movie is about a girl who turns into a red panda when she can't control her motions. This is introduced to her as a curse passed through generations of women. There is a cure however she learns to control her emotions and learns to live with this instead of fighting against this. This is a strong message for young girls going through puberty. Good funny movie.","13 March 2022",7,0,2
"Turning Red","I have been looking forward to this movie since I first saw the trailer. We watched it tonight on Disney Plus, and it exceeded expectations during family movie night!

1. It's set in 2002 and completely nails middle school culture of the early aughts. The slang (""da bomb!""), the awkward preteen fashion (down to the black fingernail polish), the boy band craze, burnt CDs, tomagotchis, passing notes during class, and the math teacher being a male coach wearing a track suit. It was all a flashback to my middle school days. 😅

2. It doesn't shy away from blunt references to a preteen girl starting her first period, which shouldn't be a taboo topic but somehow always has been. Good for them for breaking that wall. The whole movie is essentially an allegory for puberty.

3. As with Encanto and so many other millennial made kids' movies in the 2020s, overcoming generational trauma is a prevailing theme, and I'm ALWAYS here for that message.","13 March 2022",10,2,5
"Turning Red","""Turning Red"" is honestly up there in my favorites for Disney/Pixar films. It handles the concepts of coming of age and puberty really well and is full of heart warming and relatable scenes. I think this film is great for all ages and has a lot of culture within its context.","14 March 2022",8,1,4
"Turning Red","I really enjoyed this movie and anyone who's from Canada or visited Canada will appreciate the scenery ... I love the diversity of all the characters and representation, its amazing. Especially the Tim bits cameo! I get Kim's convenience vibes.

It's represents that era of the early 2000's perfectly , tamagotchi's , boy bands and all that ...
Plus an all women team running the movie is the best !","12 March 2022",10,2,7

And the anime style is very amazing.","29 March 2022",10,1,4
"Turning Red","I wish people would get over this is an enjoyable movie.

But I took it at face value.","13 March 2022",,1,8

"Turning Red","I am not that big a fan of computer-animated films. But, this movie changed my views. 1hr 39mins of fullon entertainment. The movie is straight to the point and it will never bore. I just love the comedy part, I kept laughing till my belly ached. I can keep watching this animated fantasy all day. I would love to give it a 10 upon 10, but the ending part didn't let me do so. The ending could have been better.","28 May 2022",9,0,3
"Turning Red","Turning Red spoke to me as an 17 year old Asian as a sweet and hard-hitting film about generational trauma. I watched this a day after I watched Everything everywhere all at once and though it didn't tear me up as much as the latter did, it still made me cry and think about my parents.

The dilemma of having the desire to just be allowed to want even one thing after working hard all your life to honor your parents' wishes and the need to live up to said parents' expectations because that's all you've known is a very real one and I think this film portrays that very well. Meilin's friends were so lovable and I'm so glad they were there to support her when no one else did. But I love how they also showed the effects of her mother's own trauma with her mother. It gives her the sympathy she needs from us.

I understand that people who don't relate to the situation might not enjoy this movie but also I see a lot of reviewers in the comments just being butthurt tiger parents/-in-making lol (I feel sorry for your children)
You may think that ""oh if Meilin wasn't so influenced by her friends and 4-town and etc. She would still be a straight A student who is filial to her mother"" but honestly it's more likely that she would've been pushed too hard (just like her mother was) as she grew and end up unhappy and overworked which is so common amongst my friends and in the current generation of Asian teenagers dealing with similar situations.

Sure, it may have a simple storyline, but the message is there and I'd like to think that 13 year old me would've loved and needed this film. Another great addition to the recent burst of films touching on generational trauma.

My final rating on this is 7.5.","1 April 2022",8,2,6
"Turning Red","First of, is this movie amazing? No. Is this movie awful and deserves to be dragged by every youtube armchair critic in their mid 20's? Also no.

This movie is a comedy for kids and speaks primarily to a certain demographic of kids, and when you watch it as that, then it's perfectly serviceable.

Sure the ""it's for kids, stop complaining"" argument is a tired and worn out saying with no merit, as you can make kids movies with rich stories and profound messages, as Pixar have been known to do. It's no Soul, Toy Story, Incredibles, Coco, Ratatouille etc. But it's also not a glorified pandering toy commercial like Cars 2.

This movie feels more like a smaller project made by a smaller more specific team by Pixar, that's made more as a ""stream at home with the kids"" kind of movie rather than a ""go to the cinema as a 23 year old alone"" kind of movie.

You could be disappointed in Pixar's general fall from grace as the top dog in western animation, but Pixar have been on a mediocre streak for years now, and Turning Red is most certainty better than all of their other low points as a studio.

Overall an inoffensive movie that's somehow turned an audience it was never even intended for against it. If you're over the age of 18, go watch something else instead of complaining on the internet.","27 April 2022",7,0,2
"Turning Red","Just watched this. As an Asian-American who has supportive parents and a great relationship with my mom, I am turned off by the constant narrative of ""tiger moms"" and ""helicopter moms"" in Asian American stories.

But what is even more annoying is the CONSTANT teaching in these new Disney movies about, ""follow your heart! Who cares what your parents say? They don't know any better, go ahead and disobey them!! Do what YOU want to do!"" there is no medium of actually communicating, respecting and learning from each other. I don't believe most kids these days will benefit from the message of when your parents tell you something you don't like, just ignore their instruction.","11 September 2022",4,1,4
"Turning Red","We spent a lovely time with our kids in the move with full of laughs and enjoyment. The sounds of the move is great, the scenes are excitedly, the characters are contacting to each others and the storyline is brilliant. In general I'd highly recommend the family's to watch this movie and I'm sure they will have fun.","13 March 2022",10,4,14
"Turning Red","Fantastic movie for the whole family or anyone!! Great comedy for all ages and love the Canadian hints throughout the movie. The storyline is on point and hoping there will be a second movie!!","13 March 2022",8,2,5
"Turning Red","Turning Red is another Pixar triumph. It's heartwarming, blunt, transparent, and bursts with imagination. For a film about a girl turning into a giant red panda, it's incredibly human. This has to be the most unique and moving coming-of-age story I've seen in a long time and I can't stop thinking about it. In fact, it's my new favorite of that genre and among my Pixar Top 5. It nails the awkwardness and hardships of finding yourself to a tee while being an endearing love letter to the early 2000s, which had a distinctive youth culture.

I felt very at home with Turning Red. I related so much with Mei and her journey because I too had a messy childhood with ruthless expectations bogging me down, preventing me from finding my own path. I completely understood the frustration and confusion Mei goes through. You don't have to be of a specific gender or ethnicity to get it. This is growing up. Sure, everyone deals with it differently but (like what Mei's voice actress Rosalie Chiang said) the core messiness is something that everyone can relate to.

Turning Red also boasts gorgeous art direction, which is very colorful, expressive and anime-inspired. Plus Ludwig Göransson's score is a character-driven blend of timely beats and cultural instrumentals (with a touch of magical girl anime). The film is a total feast for the eyes and ears throughout.

Turning Red is a humorous, heartfelt, and honest reflection of the trickier times in our youth - from the changes to your body, interests, attitude, and the relationships with your family and friends. Beautifully nuanced from beginning to end, and the emotional resolution is absolute perfection. It's got so much personality and it's such a breakout film for Pixar, culturally and thematically. I loved every minute of it. The studio still has it.","4 June 2022",10,1,4
"Turning Red","I really recommend this movie to all the parents. They need to realize that becoming a woman is more than a period cycle. I strongly believe that all the traditional beliefs must change and accept young girls and women as who they truly are not whom you want them to be. The movie spectacularly teaches young generation to accept their true nature and stop being a puppet.","3 April 2022",10,1,5
"Turning Red","The movie was great, so sad that's a straight to streaming release, cute artstyle(quite experimental for pixar) and great art direction. The plot is a bit weird and childish, but I worked...
I am giving it 8 out of 10 cuz I know the fandom is gonna be something...
Yikes...","19 March 2022",8,1,3
"Turning Red","""Turning Red"" isn't a bad movie. Visually, it's beautiful. The animations are perfect. Story-wise, it's okay. This is an okay movie. Something you'll enjoy but not gush over.

Because the writing is far from a home run. The movie sends a lot of mixed messages, and despite the great voice-acting, the characters are flat.

We get to know the main character, and her mother a bit, but everyone else is just there as support.

However, there are some touching moments, and you do feel for the little girl. She is turning red, and also growing up at the same time. This is a coming of age story.

A girl with an overbearing mother is trying to be her own person, and the one thing she wants more than anything in the world is to see a boy band concert with her best friends. The problem is she turns into a giant, red panda when she gets emotional.

Funny, and entertaining at times, though it misses the mark being too simple, and cliched. Yes, you will find some originality in this film, but in its entirety it is predicatable. It is lacking in depth.","24 June 2022",7,0,5
"Turning Red","Sooooo good and relatable as a woman! I don't think I've ever seen that 12-14yo time of a girls life better represented then in this movie. It's a confusing, messy, embarrassing time but more so it's a fun time when you really are branching out from your family and figuring out who you are and this movie portrayed that SO WELL!

I was laughing and crying the whole time, easily top 10 movie of all time for me!!","12 March 2022",10,2,8

"Turning Red","By Maryam Tavatav (Critic)

""Turning Red"" is a 2022 American animated fantasy comedy film produced by Pixar Animation Studios. The story is about Mei Lee, a 13-year-old Chinese-Canadian student who, as she begins to show signs of puberty, learns that when expressing strong emotions like anger or stress, she transforms into a giant red panda due to a hereditary curse. The carefully-chosen title of the film is also taken from Mei Lee's father's quotation saying ""Red is the color of luck.""
Directed by a Chinese-born Canadian female director, the animated film features detailed images of puberty thanks to the creativity of Domee Shi's team of writers. This film, with its colorful and flamboyant illustrations in various scenes, demonstrates a surreal image of the reality and concerns of the characters involved in the issue of puberty. In fact, this animation tries to exaggerate reality in a way to create a more attractive output with its brilliant ideas.

Turning Red devotes meticulous attention to details to articulate the main point of the film with lasting delicacy. Neither does the film opt for a simplistic portrayal of puberty, nor does it tend to make a terrible tragedy out of the various complexities and consequences of this period. It just attempts to accompany a teenager during this transition time and brings forward topics like femininity, dynamism, and growth; on the other hand, in this way, it did not go towards one-sided narratives but rather depicts a world of logic and displays the audience an unimpeded view of stress and identity crisis along with physical changes in the life of a teenage girl in order to create a sense of credibility.

The audacity put in portraying the deep concept of puberty in this film carries the message that issues about which no one has talked publicly out of shame are not to be ignored forever. Especially since Mei Lee comes from a family with Chinese cultural background and, besides family traditions, undergoes strange experiences during puberty. This cultural context sets the stage for the use of mythological and metaphorical concepts in advancing the narrative of the animated film.

The film can be divided into two main halves, and realistically, the story declines in the second half in terms of engaging the viewer since its focus mainly shifts from Mei Lee to those around her. While during the first half, we are faced with Mei Lee's teenage world with all her rebelliousness, desires, and playfulness. It is as if from the middle of the animation onwards, the story separates from its original and main meaning and leaves behind the profoundness that was prevailing in the narrative. In the second half, the film shows the image of a new world and tries to make this unknown new world more familiar.

In the second half, perhaps, if the initial idea and focus of the film on the issue of puberty had progressed as deeply as in the first half, the animation would have been more distinguished and hard to forget. Simply put, in the second half of the narrative, the film builds up other seemingly deep themes, which do not have much of a logical function in the narrative of the main storyline; however, it is not yet possible to easily overlook the technicolor of vivid images and the details of a teenage life struggling with the consequences of puberty.

Turning Red tackles a topic that is considered taboo in some cultures. And indeed, cinema can play an effective role in changing this view. The fact is, however, that the later this issue is addressed, the later it would be possible to normalize it and move on to the deeper parts of adolescence.

Another important concept that is denounced in this film is the effort to satisfy everyone, and surely this struggle and the sense of not being enough and running after others to please them is a source of great suffering that would continue until the end of one's life. This unsuccessful attempt to keep others happy makes a man a slave who walks and lives to the wishes of those around him. Turning Red animation slams the judgment of others in one's life and puts value on personal growth and the effort to find one's best form in order to convey the message that one can love others and walk one's own way at the same time.

Depicting the intricacies of puberty in cinema in the form of animation, in modern times, and within the waves of cultural and social issues, is quite intriguing to the viewers, especially since Turning Red tackles mental independence. It can be said that such films are capable of filling the void of attention to many critical life events and pave the way for recognizing the mental characteristics of teenagers on the verge of puberty to help them succeed in this process of discovery and intuition to find their true identity.","26 April 2022",6,0,2
"Turning Red","This movie in undoubtedly for teenage girls, is this a bad thing? No, its just if your a guy or maybe older you won't get as much enjoyment as anyone could get out of something like toy story or incredibles. It has a good message, or being yourself and not always having to follow family traditions since they can be harmful. The animation is pretty fun and active, the voice acting is too be honest ok, and the story has its ups and downs. It's a 7 for general audiences, but if your a teenage girl or girl in general it could be a 7.5 to an 8 out of 10. Also for the needless haters of this movie, no its not turning your kids into Marxists, if so then the basic idea of change is Marxism meaning that the American revolution was a Marxist event to you.","12 March 2022",7,2,8

"Turning Red","As someone who grew up in the early 2000's, this movie was a perfect blast from the past. From the endless references to all early 2000's pop culture, to the absolute horror of going through puberty, this movie really nailed it on the head. I think this is a wonderful movie to watch with young children to start a conversation about the changes they will be going through as they get into their teenage years. It is subtle, and handles it with a witty humor that doesn't completely gross the viewer out. The characters are well developed and all have their own unique personalities. The dynamics between the characters are adorable and hilarious, and honestly remind me a lot of how my friends and I acted at that age. It tackles generational trauma, and breaking the cycle in an emotional and enlightening way. It is a must see for the typical Disney/Pixar lover, but also for those who just want a feel good movie on. The soundtrack was fire, the jokes were on point, and the story was well orchestrated. 10/10 I recommend.","16 March 2022",10,2,7
"Turning Red","Turning Red is an inspirational drama about a teenage girl who has to overcome her own inner struggles and the pressures of fitting in. It follows the journey of one girl, played by China Anne McClain, in the small town of Fairpoint, Texas, who is dealing with transitioning into adulthood, finding her own identity and becoming comfortable with who she is.

The movie focuses on her relationships with her family, friends, and even strangers. It's especially touching that she learns to embrace her strengths and weaknesses with the help of her mother and her best friend.

The visuals in Turning Red are simply stunning, highlighting the small town with bright colors and a rural charm that will instantly make viewers feel at home. The acting is also great, with McClain's performance being particularly impressive.

Overall, Turning Red is a delightful film that is sure to leave viewers feeling thankful for the things that make us who we are and the people who have helped us become who we are today. It's a heartfelt coming-of-age story that will stay with viewers for a long time. Highly recommended.","6 January 2023",8,0,0
"Turning Red","User Reviews about not resonating because the character or family is not your traditional western looking/sounding family shows there is a long way to go in society on breaking cultural stereotypes - for any culture in fact.

This movie had it all and what id expect ina Pixar film. Im not even the target demo and i still enjoyed the story, its coming of age themes, family obligations in your teen years...it was just refreshing to see Pixar taking good risks, telling stories other than sequels of talking Toys, Cars, Monsters, Superhero families.

Not that those are bad at all, but original stories matter and shape the young kids who watch your films.

Ignore the negative/xenophobic reviews, those come from narrow minded people and will never add value to your life or the world. Go see this movie!","9 October 2022",10,0,2
"Turning Red","This film is absolutely precious. I reminded me of how important it is to have a group of close friends when you're growing up and finding yourself.

"Turning Red","Being an 18 years old teen, this movie has a lot of ""Man, I had the same feeling too as I was 13!"" moments. Like abnormality on emotions, wanting to be alone, sometimes rebelling...

Although I'm not a fan of Chinese rituals and storylines, the base story is nicely composed. The graphics are really outstanding, it's amazing to look at how Disney and Pixar advanced since the Toy Story years.

The storyline is based in 2002, it would be nice to see Mei grow up at the end of the movie.

Overall, the movie is worth watching. Would watch it again next time with my 13 years old little brother :D.","13 March 2022",8,0,3
"Turning Red","While I imagine younger audiences might enjoy this movie, this certainly isn't very enjoyable for the average movie watcher above the age of 13. Watch with kids, or if you have kids- for sure, but otherwise.. i don't reccomend.

And funny 😂...","12 March 2022",10,2,9
"Turning Red","Just watched this with my 17 yo daughter and we found many similarities to her real life. A certain male singer who used to sing with a boy band about 8-10 years ago. Certainly some will relate. My daughter loved it and we talked about the stress of trying to cope with our changing bodies, behaviors and hormones. We definitely bonded over this movie and thought it was really well done! Teens need more movies like this. That say it's ok to have their own feelings and not fit in a perfect box. Well done, Pixar!","13 June 2022",9,1,5
"Turning Red","This was an amazing film. From the story to the animation it is nearly flawless. The reason that I say nearly flawless is because there is only one thing holding this phenomenal film back, and it's not to the films discredit at all. The only thing that holding this film back is that it was not released in theaters. While this film is amazing either way it was not meant to be seen on an iPad screen. This being released on Disney Plus is a complete slap in the face to the animators that worked years on this. The animation that's meant for iPad screens is coco melon not a Pixar movie. Like imagine if wall-e was released on Disney Plus, it is a completely different experience and it would have never been the modern classic or cinematic masterpiece that it is today. This is like releasing The Dark Night on paramount plus.","14 March 2022",9,0,7
"Turning Red","I love this movie, love love love the animation style and the character designs!

The story was amazing, the art style had great visuals which made me surprised since disney/pixar consistently make typical 3D generic animation. This had such a great mix of 2D pop art and the fluidity of 3D animation!","27 March 2022",10,2,7
"Turning Red","This movie was a different experience for me. It depicts perfectly the crisis every teen faces with their overprotective parents. Abiding by every family rule can lead to success, but when the child is growing up, they need some freedom to make their choices. This movie gives a good message to the parents also. If the parents are so strict and not willing to listen to their children, it can cause a distance between them, and eventually, the child may lie to hide themselves.","4 April 2022",10,0,3
"Turning Red","Really enjoyed this. Had hilarious moments that had me laughing out loud and yet the story and meaning was so relevant to those growing up who feel they have to prove themselves yet want their voice to be heard loudly and be seen for who they are. The message of this movie resonated and reminds me of so many other animated movies, Luca, defies his family and discovers himself in the end. The little mermaid defying her father and discovers herself in the end. So many others.","27 March 2022",10,2,7
"Turning Red","My 8 and 12 year old daughters really loved this movie. They have re-watched it a couple of times now.

The movie is funny and fun to watch for both kids and parents. The mom character was a bit stereotyped and exaggerated, but the daughter and the family dynamics are very real. I can relate a lot to the movie. For example, in one scene, the girl said something and my husband and I looked at each other and nodded, because one of my friends had said exactly the same thing to her daughter :)

Overall, a fun movie I really enjoy. I would recommend it to any tween or teenage kids and their parents.","25 October 2022",8,0,1
"Turning Red","The movie is interesting I really enjoyed watching it but the ending of the story isn't good. Why will they allow her to keep such a thing that is not acceptable in the society. What Disney is trying to say in these movie isn't motivating for children. They are trying to brainwash them into thinking that anything that comes there way they should accept it which is not meant to be because they are things that will spoil the society and help the society. At the age of 13 a little girl think she is already mature enough, that her mother should accept her own decision no matter the consequences. Which Disney later allow her to have. That's why I said she made a bad decision in allow to keep the panda . Just like children out in the world thinking when they are 13 the can do whatever the want and parent will accept them wrongly that's why it affects them in there future. Disney need to allow the story of the movie to be something that will show them children at an early age you should allow your parents to assist you in Making better decisions.","12 March 2022",6,1,4
"Turning Red","The way the 13 y.o girls were portayed were on points, I could see myself when Mei started drawing these anime self insert fanart. I could see myself enjoy ""cringy"" songs back in middle school/early high school.

This movie was an great throwback and an even greater coming of age story.","30 March 2022",8,0,3

"Turning Red","Turning Red is a coming of age film of a young girl in Toronto heading into puberty. At times there's parallels of a girl dealing with getting her first period, however the story does take the metaphor into the territory of having an anterior form into a literal red panda.

As a women who was a preteen entering maturity during these same years it was comically nostalgic to watch this film. I also resonate with the pressures of perfection within family which is a recurring theme of the movie. This movie appeals to younger viewers and adults. It seems the early 2000s is trending in fashion so this movie is attractive to those of gen z too. It's nice to see Disney create a film that relates to a female entering adulthood which has previously been seen as taboo and ""gross and disgusting"" determined by antiquated male morals and white patriarchal culture.

This film remained entertaining through out and had many giggle-worthy moments appealing to adults who were growing up during the turn of the millennium.

It was unique, which I enjoyed, but not amazing or providing that child-like wonder that comes from other Disney films.","13 March 2022",6,0,9
"Turning Red","This is probably the best animation I've watched this year, with only two movies on the list. It narrates a story about a tiger Asian mom who goes all her way to keep her child from socialization, even turning into a giant red panda. The animation film is a successful mix of animation, Chinese culture, North American culture, and East Asian parental ideology. It serves as a parody of the conventional ways that Asian parents guard their children. My overall viewing experience is superb.

I've never heard of any folktales about red pandas, but I'd say all the depictions in this movie about Asian parents are very real. My parents are free-range parents, but I've had friends who have parents like that. Their mom would literally keep them in their house all day to supervise them doing their homework, and teenage love is a red flag for most Asian parents. I think Turning Red does a very good job depicting the farcical yet universal struggle of Asian parenting through its coming-of-age metaphorical storytelling and animated hyperbole.

Rosalie Chiang's voiceover is well polished with East Asian characters, particularly her high and crispy vocalization and slight Chinese accent. Sandra Oh's mom is slightly breathy but sounds exactly like a tiger mom. All the other characters are great, and the fact that their characters' ethnicities match their real ones maintains a high level of authenticity to the representation of this movie.

I wish I could also turn into a red panda who can jump around the city, but I am an Asian male.","29 March 2022",8,0,4
"Turning Red","This is written beautifully for it's audience and I respect it's depiction of relationships between mothers and daughters. Enjoyable as an adult, probably awesome for a thirteen year old.","15 March 2022",8,1,6
"Turning Red","This movie really captures the pain and angst experienced by a young teen who doesn't want to disappoint the people she loves. From her friends to her family and even herself Mei is trying to discover who she is becoming in the world. I love that Disney is finally having conversations about real things that are completely normal without censoring it or making it feel taboo.","13 March 2022",10,1,3
"Turning Red","The movie portrays the aspect of living in a womans life during puberty and showing that it's alright to express your own opinions, I don't see how it is hated by many people, come on. Just because encanto is good just doesn't mean that you should despise the other.","11 March 2022",9,0,2
"Turning Red","Worst movie I have ever seen. Panda looks like a cheap, big plushy from the old style claw machines. All characters are over the top annoying. Typical Disney - all male characters are wimps. Kids twerking, disobeying, sneaking out and lying to parents is all applauded as growing up. Although the mother in this movie embarrassed the main girl with showing up at her school with feminine pads and the many ""in your face"" references to her getting her period, I didn't make the connection that the main girl turning into the big hideous ""Red Panda"" was her getting her period. (I had to read that in another review to get that connection). Also there's ceremonial rituals that the elder women perform on the girl that make her rise up in the air and contort in weird positions (reminded me of some of the horror killings if characters in Stranger Things Season 4). Nightmare Fuel for mist. Not one redeeming quality in this movie. Don't watch! Complete waste of an evening. Stay away!","30 September 2022",1,1,5
"Turning Red","As we grow older we forget just how cringey hitting puberty and dealing with all of those emotions and situations were. This movie expresses that and also reminds us that this is the beginning of finding yourself and learning who you are. Also, how important friendships are during this time and how they change with you. I loved it and related to many parts, as both a teenager reminiscing of those confusing days and as a parent who had to teach my kids important life lessons that carried them into their own independence.","30 May 2022",10,1,5
"Turning Red","The rating is so low for this! The struggle for Asians shown and the approval needed of our relatives is real! This could also be used as an eye opener for those old gen geezers!","24 April 2022",10,1,4
"Turning Red","A great coming of age story and especially good for those who can relate to growing up in the 90s! My kids are too quite young to understand the hidden meaning but they still love it.","7 May 2022",10,0,2
"Turning Red","Turning red Is very well characterized for approaching a subject never seen before In a DIsney animation, it manages to motivate yo experience emotions with its characters to laugh and even cry at the clímax of the story; Pixar Is excellent wich each release.","20 April 2022",8,0,2
"Turning Red","My 4 and 7 year old were excited to watch this based on the trailers but we ended up turning it off. They were bored and I was uncomfortable with the more adult themes. The book of drawings and the mom confronting the boy and asking what he'd done to her daughter was kind of the last straw for us. My kids weren't enjoying it and I am not ready to explain words like pervert to them. Disappointing because I feel like the merchandise and trailers were geared toward young kids and that clearly isn't the target audience here.","11 March 2022",3,1,2
"Turning Red","Ignoring all the second hand embarrassment I felt it was AMAZING! Seeing Mai and her friends felt a lot like mine during middle school, being major fans of our favorite shows/bands making and it fun to be weird. Kudos to you pixar for making this movie just as heartfelt, relatable, and realistic as usual.","12 March 2022",7,1,4
"Turning Red","I was really excited for the release of this film and was not disappointed in the slightest. It was quite subversive in its premise as a lot of people speculated that it would be about puberty and growing up, which it was but it was also a lot more than that and I won't say too much more as not to spoil. The character were all great with fantastic voice performances all round, The music was fun and perfect for the mood the film was going for. I laughed a lot, and I cried. There is a chance this film may not be for you but if you're a fan of Luca, Coco and The Incredibles I think you'd really like this film. The only reason I don't give it a 10 is because there was a little cringe that made me die a inside just a bit and I don't think I can quite put it at ""masterpiece tier"" because of the limits of the story it was trying to tell. 9/10 Loved it.","11 March 2022",9,0,2
"Turning Red","Well, a okay film, pretty predictable plot but the animation is great as usual though. A few good scene and pretty good messages that brought out. If you have some free time to watch it, save you money and use in other movie and watch it on Disney plus.","19 April 2022",8,0,2
"Turning Red","Being a 52 year old man, I know I'm not the target audience for this movie. My 5 year old daughter loved it and is watching it again already. That's the goal.

I enjoyed much of it and there's even a ""moral"" at the end of the story that is good for everyone to hear.

I'm sure I'll watch it again.","12 March 2022",8,0,3
"Turning Red","I approached this movie with a bit of hesitation as I read and watched some reviews apriori. I knew the underlying subject that the writers wanted to put out and I imagined it would be full of stereotypical themes.

But, now, after watching the movie, I can say that yes, it does have some over-the-top and stereotypical themes (asian parents, pre-teen life, coming of age etc. ) but they are all wrapped in a cool, magical and beautifully rendered image that, quite frankly, made me quickly forget the bad parts.

The movie is charming, very funny in a bunch of sequences and full of cheeky-remarks of what it means for a girl to... well, grow up.

Call me immature, but I could not giggle everytime they mentioned how big and fluffy some character's panda was :)))

I give it 7/10. Still nothing can beat Coco or InsideOut.","20 March 2022",7,0,3
"Turning Red","When the movie focuses on the girls, it's a really enjoyable and touching story about growing up and friendships. When it focuses on the parents, not so much, it falls into the standard boring storyline told without conviction on every mediocre sitcom.","12 March 2022",6,0,0
"Turning Red","Can't understand those people who didn't liked the movie because they couldn't relate to Mei.

Like - you loved Cars because you can relate to Lightning McQueen?

And I don't think this movie teaches children to 'disobey' or run away. Just that they are their own person at the end of the day and make their own choices - sometimes if their parents like it or not.

It's about a 13 year old girl, what did you except?

I'm sure when you were 13, you felt reeeaally understood by your parents, and told them everything right?

Best you can do is love your children. Which I'm sure you do (no sarcasm). Even if you don't approve everything they do.

I really loved the movie. It's a cute coming of age.","17 March 2022",10,1,3
"Turning Red","Don't know why this seems to be getting lots of bad reviews but i liked it! I put this on for my daughters aged 12 and 9 fully expecting to spend the whole time flicking through social media however i found that i enjoyed the film as much as them. Yes the basic story line has been done before but it didn't stop the film from being good, there were some really funny parts and some food for thought moments. We loved it!","3 April 2022",9,0,3
"Turning Red","At first glance, I did not expect much from Turning Red. To be frank, the concept seemed rather outlandish, yet I can state that Pixar has done it again. Not their best film of the last few years (I much prefer Soul), but impressive nonetheless. Firstly, the goal of Turning Red to be a coming-of-age story was executed perfectly. From utterly cringeworthy moments to becoming independent, it has myriad elements that correlate with the onset of maturity. However, the style of animation was not my cup of tea. Not a massive grievance, but it should be noted. Also, much of the comedy in the film simply falls flat. One of the characters, Abby, who I assume was a comedic relief character considering she was loud and energetic for the entire film, was a chore to see on screen. Pixar typically knocks it out of the park with comedy, but Turning Red diverges from such a trend. Albeit with each negative, there were thrice as many positives. I appreciate how the film was set in 2002 to avoid the influence of technology on Mei and her peers. It limits the actions of the characters in a way that contributes positively to the theme of Turning Red, as well as the plot overall. Simply put, the voice acting was flawless. Lastly, the soundtrack for the film was exceptional. All in all, Turning Red is by no means perfect, but it acts as proof that Pixar can take a concept and work its magic. Does it necessarily deserve ""universal acclaim?"" In my opinion, no. But Turning Red is undoubtedly worth a watch, as is every Pixar film.","14 March 2022",8,1,6
"Turning Red","What we have here is a metaphorical coming-of-age tale that aims much more biologically than the genre typically goes for. References oblique and overt alike are made throughout this movie to paint this as an analogy of a woman receiving her first period, which is a feat to be applauded. We get no graphic bodily humor apart from very few fleeting entendres, and instead focus on the emotional roller-coaster which the protagonist undergoes during her body's natural changes.

Our story transpires in 2002, if I recall correctly, though features mainstays of 90s culture in the vein of Tamagotchis, algorithmic boy bands, and standard definition TV. Which I suppose makes this film a period piece. Meilin Lee is our happy-go-lucky protagonist, with an emphasis on ""go"", acting like your typical hyperactive thirteen-year-old. Her metamorphosis transpires after her mother embarrasses her something fierce and rather publicly, but unlike Gregor Samsa, her family is more accepting of this new form--up to a point. She has one shot at undergoing a ritual that will banish the red panda she becomes, and it's going to require her to come to terms with the changes her body is going through.

The animation style employs numerous different techniques which mesh together surprisingly well. While CG rendering dominates the field, we also receive allusions from classic 2D animation effects. Warning: There will be anime eyes, but since you've managed to work a computer in 2022, I'm going to assume you can handle it. Back in 2002, the CG rendering of fur was still a major challenge. We've since reached a point where composition has become forefront to the rigors of computer animation, and the use of two-dimensional lighting effects really pop out at you, making the visual delivery very satisfying.","18 March 2022",9,2,7
"Turning Red","I am a guy in his 20s, and from the trailers i didnt think i would like it, but color me surprised. The movie felt like a standard pixar disney film, but still has some unique qualites to it. There were points where i felt like i could relate in a sense even though i never exerienced those things in my life. The characters are dorky and awkward, but it works well for the story being told. I would say give the movie a try. I ended up liking it, even though i thought it wouldnt be my cup of tea.","12 March 2022",8,1,4
"Turning Red","É um filme apaixonante, ele mostra de forma bastante lúdica e divertida o amadurecimento da personagem, criando uma perfeita reflexão sobre os novos desafios que enfrentamos em nossas vidas.

Eu super amei 😍","20 March 2022",10,1,3
"Turning Red","I thought Turning Red was incredible. It so perfectly represented Asian Culture as well as the difficulty of growing up. Having overbearing parents (like many of the films haters) and constantly trying to make them proud by sacrificing what they actually love. Some see the Panda as a metaphor for a period but most kids will see it for what it actually is, you're inner self. The film is about accepting that and realizing that it's your choice who you want to be and how you want to live your life, not your parents. Ultimately the girl accepts the wonderful gift her ancestor gave to her.

For the wackos complaining that it's gross or inappropriate, you're likely either overprotective, don't understand how much your kids already know, or don't understand how film ratings work. PG literally means ""some material may not be suitable for children"" That often includes some suggestive material. And yea I'd say a strong majority of kids, boy and girl, know about periods and the word sexy and all that by the time they're 8 or 9. Some of them have already started puberty. It's empowering, and the shrudes in the crowd are only promoting more helicopter parenting and body shame.

Let your kids enjoy this film for what is truly is: a fun and smart animation that teaches the lesson of self acceptance and self love.","20 March 2022",9,0,1
"Turning Red","Very cute movie. Yes i cringed a bit giving the usual disney/pixar happy ending formula with overly happy, innocent, positive characters.

I still liked it for at least walking in a good direction where, even tough very cliche at times, it still tackles with different representation for different audiences to relate to.

It's a great singular perspective on growing up as a girl and as an immigrant. It tackles puberty, ancestry, parenting, self-identity, mental health, of course in a very light hearted way for american parents (or parents in general) to be okay with their kids watching.

So yeah, giving it a 9 just to try and compensate a bit for all the hilarious senseless hate this movie is getting for the weirdest reasons.","21 July 2022",,0,1
"Turning Red","I took the chance to watch this with our daughter and I liked it, so did our daughter.

I am of Chinese-Indonesian descent myself and our daughter is mixed because my wife is white. So I can to some extent relate to this movie. When we started to watch the movie I had to explain to our daughter that Meilin is a Chinese girl, because she didn't recognize Meilin as such initially. So here's the thing: why do the Chinese (main) characters don't look Asian at all? Meilin's mother, Meilin's father, except for Meilin's grandmother, she looks more like a Chinese woman, but that is probably because she always looks kind of angry or sullen. I am wondering if this is a wokeness thing or whatever people nowadays are busy with or is it something else? Because as far as I know, the average Chinese person would have much smaller eyes than the characters in this movie. In fact, the characters look pretty non-Asian to me, rather white. It looks like the makers wanted to avoid stereotyping. As a person of partly Chinese descent I find this a quite remarkable thing. It's not really bothering me regarding to the story, but I am just not someone that thinks that obvious physical characteristics should make way because of woke bs. When you want to display characters as Chinese, just make them look like Chinese. Perhaps just like the character Russel in Pixar's 2009 Up!, who is depicted clearly as a kid of Asian descent. Perhaps there are Chinese or other Asian people who somehow get triggered when being confronted with characters that are being displayed as Asians with small ""slanted"" eyes? But I have these eyes too and it is simply a fact that the average south-east Asian person has them too. And what is wrong with that? Would depicting Chinese characters as people with small eyes be insulting? If people, and especially Asian people, would be triggered by that, I think it's and issue they have themselves rather than it would be a general issue...","27 March 2022",8,1,5
"Turning Red","If you are 13 years old girl (like me) I'm sure you'll like it. Good visuals, characters, voice acting, and story. You will have a great time while watching it I promise.","19 March 2022",9,1,5
"Turning Red","I was honestly worried about having the discussion of periods and puberty with my 8-year-old daughter, but Turning Red did the hard part for me-unexpectedly on a Saturday morning! And I was able to involve my son in the conversation too.

So good to see so much solid representation of Middle Eastern culture throughout Canada. And I loved how this movie not only expertly empowers women, but also makes all the men appear completely beta, weak, subservient or (in the case of the boys portrayed on the movie) completely absent of any depth or feeing-just like in real life! Amirite?!

And it was also good to see the pound-the-stereotype-into-your-face of a disappointed and overbearing Asian mother. I know that Asian mothers are all demanding and angry, so it was nice to see this fact represented well in the movie.

Another Pixar gem. A truly unique plot. So good to see a coming-of-age movie where the teenage child must overcome the expectations set out for them, since that wasn't done well enough in Frozen, Moana, Inside Out, Encanto, Coco, Luca, Zootopia, Goofy Movie, Little Mermaid, Lion King, or the dozens of other unsuccessful attempts at showing the power of a child to persevere against their parents and society.

Pads, blood, tampons, oh my! Lol, so, so much fun. I love it when Disney speeds up the growing process for my kids on a Saturday morning.

Thank You!!!","13 March 2022",10,1,4
"Turning Red","Story was bad. Sex and nudity moderate. Bad and boring don't watch this movie. How Disney did this. This not kids it's almost A rated movie. Don't west your time. Turning red i think that was funny movie but it's not headeche.","24 July 2022",1,0,10
"Turning Red","I couldn't understand how can people could be so blind with their political beliefs without seeing the movie of what it's worth. But instead review bombing it for no reason. And yes I get some people are entitled to their own opinion, but you don't mixed politics with a movie that has to with a girl going through puberty in 2002 Canada.

And I want to set the record straight.

I know what it's like being a kid growing up in the decade in the 2000s' and we all go through challenges in life. I wasn't born to an Asian family nor growing up in Canada, but I can relate to MeiLin.

I was a dork and a weirdo, and of course like her I know what it's like living up to your parents' expectations of being perfect and acting perfect. And of course I wasn't like a genius like MeiLin but the one thing MeiLin has is a lot of energy.

And I don't want to forget about MeiLin's mom I mean she reminds me of my mom. I mean very protective, I mean OVERLY protective and yeah my mom is like that when she had me. But I still love her.

Anywho the movie had a mixture of humor, Japanese anime style to it, friendship, heartwarming and it also had to with the power of emotion but quite honestly it had some some surprises to it. And some twists and turns to it, oh yeah pixar has really kicking it old school with boy bands, asian mythology and of course crazy stuff that you can't possibly imagine. With a bit of scott pilgrim flavor to add to the mix.

And I cannot tell you about the Y2K style fashion this movie had with a very diverse cast of characters from a ethnic cultural background and it's not only cute but also cool!

I know this review is tone deaf I don't care what anyone else thinks. This movie really sends a message of what it's like growing up and going through changes in a unique way. I wish people could stop being so apolitical, enough with racial bias, enough with the rude snarky remarks of the art style, and more importantly don't be a jerk about it.

If you don't like the movie don't watch it. But don't tell others to skip the movie they'll watch it anyways.

And if you think it promotes wokeness the you need to look in the mirror and fix yourself. It's the year 2022 and things have gone through a rocky start. Just give it a chance, you'll may be surprised how far it would go.","13 March 2022",10,1,4
"Turning Red","At last Pixar produces an intelligent as well as entertaining movie. Reading the reviews here on imdb is a wonderful illustration of what morons most people are. ""I'm too stupid to understand this movie so it must be bad"". Or ""There is no unequivocal moral message so it's awful."" Or ""No guns, no stabbing, no fistfights?! Utter garbage."" To paraphrase another film: ""IQs have just dropped sharply."" This is a fun, insightful, engaging and well-executed movie. Watch and enjoy.","23 May 2022",10,0,3
"Turning Red","Oh c'mon, people. ""The characters are annoying,"" cool, so does that mean you can't relate to 13 year old girls in the early aughts? Because that is exactly what I was like. Amazingly, I am also able to watch movies with characters I might not relate to in the beginning, but come to see their side. That's why we watch movies, isn't it?

We're able to watch movies like the Sandlot that took place in an earlier era with kids making dumb decisions without immediately jumping to the terrifying idea that kids are what...growing up? It's called a coming of age movie for a reason.

It's a single story, that does not speak for an entire culture or age, but does a great job with its message, friendships, and family ties. I don't know if you noticed, but the fight that happened between Mei and her Mom was resolved...like a lot of fights between teenagers and parents are. So was the one between her friends, because that's what being a human is like.

The animation was gorgeously done, the ancestry story was beautiful, the songs were wonderfully boy-band-esque (kudos to Billie and Finneas for capturing that), and those friendships? They can last, trust me.

Oh...and one last thing. If you have a nine year old and they are on the precipice of puberty and they don't know what a period is? Good luck.","15 March 2022",8,0,3
"Turning Red","A very strange mix of cultures arranged in a cringy way. Not a film that is very transferrable to different groups of people maybe young girls it works for.","1 April 2022",3,2,8
"Turning Red","Turning Red is not a bad film, nor is it great. It is a sweet story that shows the struggle of a young girl figuring herself out and who she wants to be, despite the fact that her mother wants something else for her. While I do think the overall message was well intended, the execution is just over-the-top when it comes to the characters, which would be fine in any other animated movie. Pixar is capable of delivering similar messages about adolescence the struggle that comes with it but with better writing. One of the best examples would be either Finding Nemo or Inside Out. Turning Red is fun and worth looking at, but far from Pixar's best.","28 March 2022",6,0,1

"Turning Red","I believe anyone who born under Asian culture, especially with Confucius culture can feel the empathy with the characters. I really cried and laughed. I can exactly see my mom and my dad in the movie, the family structure. And I'm sure this will be one of the best movies I watch this year.

Btw I totally understand it's not easy for people who are not in the environment to get the point. But no doubt it moves me.","15 March 2022",10,2,12
"Turning Red","I am not from China and I do not have a prejudice against film, but I admit that in these 20 years, this animation was one of the most complete and best animations I have ever seen, not only referring to the subject of teenage girls, but also a lesson for all mothers. It was very informative and beautiful at any age, and the end of the animation ended very well, and like the rest of the animations, it did not have a childish ending and was very complete. I hope the second part of this animation will be made soon. I will wait until the second part of this animation is released.","6 June 2022",10,0,4
"Turning Red","I absolutely love this movie. It resonates with me and I feel a real connection with Mei Mei. A lot of people have been criticizing this movie for not being relatable or cringey. But as a 17 year old girl who has went through puberty, and liked boy bands and valued my closest friends, this movie is an actual representation of what being a pre-teen is. I've seen people talk about how it felt like an adult movie as well for it's use for words like ""stripper music"" or conversation about periods. Well guess what? That's actually how 13 year olds talk. They're loud and cringey especially to the things they are passionate about, and periods?

Oh my ! An animated movie talking about a normal function of a growing girl's body??? HOW HORRENDOUS !! THIS MOVIE IS OBVIOUSLY NOT FOR MY GROWING CHILD WHO NEEDS TO BE EDUCATED AND EXPOSED TO SOMETHING THAT THEY WILL NORMALLY EXPERIENCE 0/10 EVEN CARS 2 DIDNT SUCK THIS BAD >:((

Obviously a movie centered around a 13 year old girl won't be relatable to a 30 year old man, and the movie never expected everyone would find it relatable. There's a difference with hating a movie because it's bad and hating a movie because it's something that feels isn't catered to you.","13 March 2022",8,0,2
"Turning Red","I actually really liked it .

I felt when I was watching this movie it has so much effort put in it . I don't know what people in here expect but it did gave me what I was expected. Really good storyline ( well written ) it has great songs ( a Disney classic ) and it did satified me . What was great was its ending . I wasn't expecting that ending .Its ending specially stands out much differently compared to other Disney movies . Some people say it wasn't so general . I 'm not gonna argue with that being a general doesn't makes movies better but satifactory ending and good writing does . ( We can include some songs as well . ) Compared to other movies have been made this year it shines . And when I was prepearing for my big exam watching this was getting hugs from someone . Briefly it is cozy , cute and heart warming movie . Briefly it deserves more just give it more.","1 September 2022",9,1,3
"Turning Red","Hey! I'm around the same age as Mei (14), and I can confidently say literally nobody acts like that. Don't get me wrong, I loved the movie and it was very relatable as someone who's a burnout gifted child with Asian parents. Still, I couldn't bring myself to watch a lot of scenes because of how much second hand embarrassment I got.. the panda was cute tho, 9/10.

I cannot relate to the protagonist of this movie because, unlike i who perfectly realised who i am ever since my birth in february 1984 in toronto, ontario, canada (where this movie is set), the protagonist of this movie, mei lee, never realised what she herself got until the very morning she saw her own face in the mirror... this movie is a style-over-substance affair, the animation is quite a looker (what with visual flourishes in a few places!), but the plot of the movie itself only says the least of anything, but mei finding herself between-a-rock-and-a-hard-place in choosing whether to go to a concert ""4-town"" or stay home for her own family's ancient ritual of sorts (both happening on the same night) is a yes-or-yes question, as both events embody the power of great music!","15 March 2022",5,1,5

I grew up in America with a white father and a very strict Taiwanese mother who immigrated here in her 30s. She always pushed me to be the best version of myself and be very disciplined even though I was a very rebellious kid that wanted to ""have fun"" and ""be irresponsible"" thus meaning we butt-heads a lot and argued a decent amount. Despite our differences in priorities, I loved my mother with all of my heart. Unfortunately, she passed away very suddenly when I was 12 due to a brain aneurysm.

I came into this movie thinking it was just going to be a cute coming of age story about a girl struggling to balance her life and emotions but it was so much more. Turning Red is about the strong heritage that inspires generations to want to perfect themselves for their loved ones and the pressure that sometimes comes with it. Its about growing up in a modern world with clashing cultures, diverse ideas, and eccentric hobbies. This movie gave me back some time with my mother. It reminded me of things I haven't thought of in years and gave me hope that if my mother had survived how our relationship could've grown and blossomed into something stronger. Thank you to the creators of Turning Red for reminding me of aspects of my childhood I had buried deep and giving some closure to me in a very heartwarming story.

I know this may be an emotionally attached review, but isn't that what makes a great movie? For someone to create something that touches the heart of the viewer, to teach a lesson, or spark an idea? To me, this movie was just that and beyond.","15 March 2022",9,0,1
"Turning Red","Like this movie is not for everyone. Like it is pretty cringey at time, but that is the charm honestly. And what kid becoming a teenager isn't a little cringey growing up. EMBRACE THE CRINGE. But overall, it had a very lively cast that was fairly enjoyable to watch.","17 June 2022",8,0,3
"Turning Red","One of Pixar's best. I loved the new storytelling approach, from the thoughtful writing to the stellar animation with anime influences. I've been excited for this movie since more than a year ago and it went above and beyond my expectations. The crew put so much passion and care into the characters and story to make such a funny, heartwarming and emotional film that tackles a lot of challenging topics which should be discussed more openly. I saw a lot of myself in Meilin as a 20-something Fil-Am millennial with Chinese ancestry who was also once a perfectionist, boy band-obsessed tween, and is still trying to come to terms with navigating generational trauma.

The bad and negative reviews make me upset and disappointed that so many people find it hard and ""exhausting"" to relate to a story with universal themes that happen to center an teenage Asian girl. I'm sorry that your world is so small, isolated and lifeless that casting a light on other cultures doesn't make you feel seen.","14 March 2022",9,0,6
"Turning Red","Honestly: I've grown weary of the Pixar formular. Most of the recent outings feel boring and repetitive. But this one is really good - as it doesn't want to be more than it is. It's just a hilariously funny coming of age story that happens to be also the story about big cuddly red pandas. Love it!","28 May 2022",9,0,3
"Turning Red","This movie is much deeper than my expectations. I have to say if you are not an Asian, it is not easy to understand the torn feeling in it. In Asian, you belong to the family more than to yourself. You will have this torn feeling when there is conflict between these two.","27 May 2022",10,1,4
"Turning Red","Anyone who has lived through the hormones of early puberty should love this sweet film about Mei, her friends and her family. The kids have absolutely relatable obsessions including boys, a boy band, journals, seeing the boy band preform live and living their best teen lives, the film is also about family responsibilities, and the fears of parents. The Red Panda is both a metaphor and a totally relatable character. It is obvious that the cast and animation crew loved telling this charming story. Plus, Montreal settings. Nice.","12 March 2022",9,0,1
"Turning Red","I noticed most of the negative reviews had racist undertones or very bothered the movie tackled a topic every adult and teen goes through puberty, it's a topic we can't hide from discussing with youth since spoiler alert we all go through puberty and it can help a lot of teens process this confusing time in a comical way.

I am so tired of the fake reviews or racist trolls that come out of the wood work to bad mouth a film because they are unhappy the main characters are not the same race as them.it's 2022 grow up and if you don't like a film that's fine but leave race out of it.","11 March 2022",9,0,2
"Turning Red","I watched Turning Red, and I will say that while it was a cute movie, it's a bit (ok, very) eccentric. The friend in purple weirded me out. Girl, why are you so aggressive?? The mother was over-reactive and pretty ignorant of what it's like being a normal, turning-of-age girl in a big, Western city. She seemed to be first-generation and would have experienced it herself. I don't get why she's being a crazy Tiger mom when she knows the awkwardness her daughter is going through, and *you'd think* wouldn't want to embarrass her in front of others.

The film was using over-the-top anime style and humor with Pixar-quality animation and it seemed to clash for me.

I did find the boy band obsession part relatable, and honestly, nothing offensive in regards to being turned on at that age. Y'all, I was obsessed with *NSYNC and Jonathan Taylor Thomas as a kid! It's definitely relatable and yeah - girls get their period around 13. I was actually 11 and was taught about female reproductive parts and menstruation in 5th grade. It's normal and not that big of a deal, although it's definitely awkward when you start developing breasts, bloating, having cramps, accidental period stains in the middle of school... 😰

When it comes to being an Asian Canadian, I can't relate, but that doesn't really matter usually. I loved the director's short, ""Bao,"" and been though I'm not a Chinese mom with a son, I still could get the story, because it's something all mothers can relate to. I thought about my mom and brother. Also, just like in Turning Red, The Little Mermaid, Brave, amongst other stories, it has a kid rebelling against the mother and eventually coming to an understanding and peace at the end.

Turning Red is cute, but it is a bit much. Like eating way too much Pixie Stix and pizza. I'd say watch it and enjoy it with your family, but don't expect a tear-jerking classic like we've come to know from Pixar.

6/10.","14 March 2022",6,0,3
"Turning Red","Absolutely gorgeous so so sososoosso good i dont even have the words but every aspect was good ...love seeing some sort of representation of intergenerational trauma on screen ...im obsessed.","28 March 2022",10,1,5
"Turning Red","I am all for promoting ""coming of age"" but this isn't exactly the message I want my kids to see. Girls exploiting their periods for gain??? What girl does that?? If the movie was to promote humor, all I see is a girl being bullied for something she can't control.....what message does that send?? It seems to me Pixar is using a girl to either be made fun of for becoming a woman, having a period should be exploited and having a period makes you a crazy person!

Having a ritual isn't going to make your view of a period, go away. Did men come up with this story line??? Pixar what were you thinking?? Shame on you Pixar, girls should be betrayed better than this. My 12 old niece asks, is this how the world sees a girl on her period??? A girl on her period is the villain??? What were you thinking???","31 March 2022",3,1,5
"Turning Red","This movie is different from any other movie I've ever seen, but there's something truly magical about this movie. If this isn't Disney, I don't know what is. But this hit all the right marks that qualify for a great Disney movie.

Animation: I really don't know why people dislike the animation. I can't recall another movie where I wanted to crawl into the screen and try the food or hug the panda, and it's something that doused gasoline on my Disney bonfire. It perfectly fits it's style, and it proves that it doesn't have to look super realistic to be enjoyable (sure, Soul looked wonderful, but it was aiming for a different style). Everything was well executed and every scene was crystal clear. It made the movie very enjoyable, along with a load of endearment.

Story: Pixar has covered every inch of the universe with unimaginable creativity, from floating houses to superhero families, and this one manges to do something different from the rest, but that's what makes it SO GOOD! For someone in their early teens, I found lots of parts of this pretty relatable with a twist. What one might say is over-exagerated, I found it right on the nose. That and the characters were very fun to see on screen.

Characters: Each character in this film represented a different aspect of myself and my friends, with Mei being a small mix of all. The energetic one, the silent but powerful one, and the fun but realistic one. It portrays friendship as a powerful thing, and it can get everyone who remembers what Middle School was like to recall their early teen years. None of them were truly annoying, each had their moments, and overall, I feel like they're perfectly fitting the bill for a Pixar/Disney character. They represent the franchise well.

Overall Feelings: This movie has now topped my Disney lists, and while it'll take a while before nostalgia can kick in like Incredibles, Walle and Up, I can say surely that this movie did everything right. Very adorable and would recommend for anyone who enjoys a good Disney movie and nostalgia.

Top marks, 10/10.","1 April 2022",10,0,5

"Turning Red","From the story to the animation, this movie was beautiful. It was about a girl trying to figure herself out as she's aging while battling the pressures of being the ""good girl"" her mother expects her to be. This is completely relatable to my experience growing up. I can't say enough great things about it. The story development, animation, nods to 2000s culture, humor, music, and everything in between was a hit. Thank you to the creators of this movie for making something I didn't know I needed. Also, my boyfriend is a 4townie.","18 April 2022",10,1,5
"Turning Red","Turning Red has a lot of firsts in it. Namely, directly speaking of and alluding to puberty, namely menstruation and the development of sexual feelings in a Disney film, at least involving actual adolescents. Hunchback still ranks as the balliest edition in the Disney canon for mature themes, but in this film the themes are breezily introduced, in a way that feels refreshingly organic. This is actually where the film really shines, capturing that madcap ""obnoxiously over confident but secretly a sweating mess"" part of growing up, with a fun cast and great, energetic animation.

My favourite part is actually the first third of this film, before the Panda stuff - the girls are funny and the small, slice of life tidbits, such as drooling at an overworked teenager in a drug store reminds me of a 2000s Stand By Me sequence. When you are a tween, a pop concert can feel as vital and essential as fighting off a dragon. The anime references and cultural nods settle this firmly in the 2000s. As somebody who was roughly this age around this era, this is a brilliant time capsule for glossy magazines and motto stickers you would slap onto your pencil case. The environment and word building is delightful.

Then the Panda appears. Initially, the darkness present in both the comedy and confusion creates an interesting premise for our lead character and her caring if controlling mother. The mythic elements are beautifully woven into the story. Images of red pandas and lanterns and fabrics and blood moons almost become a suffocating nightmare, before we peddle away into a get rich quick scheme involving the aforementioned concert and Mei beginning to realise both the costs (and benefits!) of developing her own self.

If there is a downside, the film loses a little focus around the middle, at least in plot. The good news are the jokes and animation and characters are still top notch, up until the action oriented end, where the film goes off the rails a little too erratically. Of course, everything turns out alright, but it moves off into a generic finale as opposed to capitalising on that brilliant, personable first act. I would have liked a bit more bright and bizarre topped with a touch of that second act darkness, but overall this is a (mostly) fresh and spirited take on a coming of age story, a lighter reflective of stories like Teen Wolf and Ginger Snaps. Certainly worth a watch.","14 March 2022",7,0,2
"Turning Red","I decided watching this on a plane ride and ended up crying three times during the film, with tears and snot dripping down in my maskI I'm 26 years old by the way. Even though i'm an ""adult"" I can still relate to Meimei's struggle of breaking out of her mom's protective confines and trying to gain her independence and individuality. It was also a powerful portrayal of family relationships/conflicts between Meimei and her mom, with Meimei's mom and grandma.

I definitely recommend watching this movie! It will hit so close to home, especially if you come a from an immigrant Asian family. I wished I had this movie when I was growing up!","1 January 2023",9,0,0
"Turning Red","Pixar is definetely the leading in modern western animation. But this last movie is really nothing special. As someone who has watched all of the other pixar films,this just feels like 'yet another pixar movie' I feel like if film was older and I watched in my childhood, I would mix the plotpoints with other pixar films. But Hey! At least there is a scene which I can convince myself tobe a Ben 10 reference.","21 June 2022",6,0,4
"Turning Red","Mei Lee (voice of Rosalie Chiang) is a confident, dorky 13-year-old torn between staying her mother's dutiful daughter and the chaos of adolescence. Her protective, if not slightly overbearing mother, Ming (voice of Sandra Oh), is never far from her daughter - an unfortunate reality for the teenager. And as if changes to her interests, relationships and body weren't enough, whenever she gets too excited (which is practically ALWAYS), she ""poofs"" into a giant red panda.","11 March 2022",9,0,3
"Turning Red","This has got to be one of the best coming-of-age movies I've ever watched! I'm not the biggest fan of movies, but this one kept my attention all the way until the ""Disney+"" logo at the end. Along with two Emma Stone movies and a few musicals, this is my next favorite! This incredible film explores early puberty with Meilin, the 13 year old who hasn't quite found her own way in the world. She's also accompanied by her three best friends, the only problem is, her mother is always on her tail, making sure her grades are perfect, her interests stay boy-free, and that she is perfect. This movie is aimed at a teenage (primarily female) audience, so there is talk of periods, pads, boys, etc... but, this movie is so much more than that. The way they use the panda to represent puberty has got to be one of the most original ideas ever! I couldn't help but relate to all of the awkwardness and crazy mood swings throughout the movie (I'm a teenager myself). I also enjoyed the mother-daughter relationship throughout the movie, it's so realistic! The fact that all the different friends showed a different teenage emotion throughout the movie made me love it even more (it reminded me a lot of Inside Out!). Without the giant panda, Meilin was already facing a lot, how will she learn to cope? If you're anything like me, the end will bring tears to your eyes and memories that you'd long forgotten!","12 March 2022",9,0,2
"Turning Red","I thought it was fun good movie, yet the reason why I am writing this. Is due to the number of people that have chosen to take strong political stances over the movie, when the reality is there was none to be had in my opinion.

The most prominent complaint is it leans far left. In which I don't feel like any of that was achieved at all in the movie. Essentially the movie is about going though puberty and the changes your body goes through. In that it essentially is rebeling against you, along with making you have feelings and thoughts that you never had before. All while becoming slightly rebellious like any teenager would go through during puberty.

With the other main complaint being sexual content and again none of that is very present. The movie is rated PG, which means in the first place there will be moments that you may have to explain to kids. In that if you are not ready to do that, nor want to, then you don't let them watch the movie, plain and simple. People need to understand that ratings are present for a reason, and it's up to you to do your own due diligence and your own determining as to what you want to show your kids. In any case they aren't blatantly being sexual honestly, and even the couple moments that it could be argued are light enough to where the PG rating stands for a reason.

People seem to be making mountains out of mole hills with this movie. Something that seems to be extremely common right now. In which I'm here to say none of that is truly present, and I don't get why people are being so outraged over nothing.","12 March 2022",9,0,2
"Turning Red","I didn't think about seeing the movie until I saw that billie and finneas had written the songs, THE MOVIE IT'S REALLY GOOD! I loved the character development, the realism of the protagonists as teenagers, the script, it's one of my favorite Disney movies! Besides that it is very entertaining, I think it is even much better than ENCANTO and this movie deserves more recognition, the only problem with the movie was that they made an effort to demonstrate and affirm that Miriam is straight all the time, why they had so much urgency to demonstrate that she is straight?🤣🤣 It became a bit homophobic because it seems as if Disney is afraid that people think that Miriam is not straight, but in general I liked the movie.","12 March 2022",9,0,1
"Turning Red","While I had reservations in the first 20 minutes or so, by the end of it I felt like I had, indeed, watched a Pixar movie. I even teared up at a few scenes so it passed the Pixar cry test, which Luca did not pass for me!

I think the reason some people find the characters difficult to relate to is the heavy exaggeration of the teenage girl stereotype, the heavy reliance on Chinese cultural stereotypes, and the ""gen z"" style of the character introductions. I found myself cringing a lot during these fast paced beginning sequences; they seem to rely a lot on the assumption of shared cultural knowledge on the viewer's end and play these themes very straight. I get what they were going for but it made the characters and initial storyline feel very one note and trite. We see a little more nuance to some of the characters by the end of the film, especially Mei's mother, but like Luca I didn't feel like I saw quite as deep character exploration as many other Pixar films.

There is also the uncomfortable subject matter of puberty that gets discussed a lot in the film. I am a woman and do not shy away from this topic in real life when speaking to grown ass adults, regardless of gender. I did, however, feel the context of this subject matter a little delicate when put into a kids film. Pixar's previous films usually handled more complicated adult subject matter a little differently from what I recall; any of that nuance would go right over a kid watcher's head while not detracting from the enjoyment of the story for the kids and providing more depth for the adults. I think Turning Red's approach is way more on the nose, and from what I've seen from other reviews this also confuses the story for kids who haven't learned about puberty stuff, both relating to sexual attraction and menstruation. I don't have kids but found myself uncomfortable with the idea of explaining this stuff to a kid because of the movie, so I get the backlash on that side of things.

Aside from these issues, I found the characters more likable and relatable as the movie went on, and the film does wrap up nicely with a message about growing into your own person while also maintaining a connection with your past and your family. I think the aunties were super epic and wish we saw more of them! I also found the animation well done despite being a little annoyed at the main character's Wallace-and-Grommet-style bean mouth; the visualizations of the temple and bamboo forest were really beautiful. I also really liked the Chinese background music and the boy band songs (though that 90s-style music is also something that really once again plays on shared cultural knowledge).","13 March 2022",7,0,1
"Turning Red","Look, I'll be very honest. This movie has a niche. Its not for everyone and I think a lot of the reviews are coming from people who expect every Disney movie to be as universally appealing as possible. This one really isn't.

The puberty metaphor is so obvious that honestly if you didn't experience biological female puberty I don't know how you sat through this. But for those of you who DID go through that, who have had to deal with the responsibility of being the perfect daughter while trying to find yourself in the process, you will resonate with this movie and cry. It's such a charming take on that story. The family is adorable; unlike Encanto there was never a time where I thought the family didn't love one another outside of familial bonds. I love their dynamic so much and I'm glad that this movie had the character growth that Encanto was severly lacking. I'm sure a lot of you will see yourself in this family, regardless of your background and cultural identity.

If you were ever a 13 year old girl, especially one that had to live up to your family's huge expectations for you, please watch this movie. It's always nice to see your experience depicted on screen.","15 March 2022",8,0,1
"Turning Red","Turning Red is a movie made for everybody in spite of what some other reviews might say. At it's core it's about puberty and overcoming the distance that usually creates with your own family, and that's something everybody can relate to. It's about the struggle of finding out who you are and adjusting that to what the world wants you to be; it's about really being into something that your parents don't understand. It's about family and how that changes when you grow older.

It's inoffensive, this won't change your life but it might make your evening a little brighter.","15 March 2022",7,0,1

"Turning Red","I didnt think I would enjoy this movie as much as I did. With disney movies these days I'm quite hard to please since they haven't had a good film in awhile. Pixar knows what they are doing. Thought it was much better than Encanto.

For those that say the main character (or any of the younger characters) is annoying, thats how 13 year old kids are. I was cringey and annoying too. We all were. If you found Mei annoying I don't want to know how you'll handle your own children when they turn that age. This movie won't be relatable for everyone and thats okay. You can enjoy a movie and not relate to the characters. It's time we got a story about puberty and growing up.❤","28 March 2022",9,0,2

He hardly does anything, but the lovely movie and storyline made up for this minor inconvenience; the most beautiful animation I've seen this year, sorry Encanto, but this movie is lengths better. The coming of age storyline, (instead of princesses with flowing dresses) makes it feel more relatable, but then flooding the Disney magic straight back into it through the lovable red panda.

The first scene is a picture of near years 1994 and the girl was already a few years old in that picture and the movie came out in March of 2022..... The main character in the storyline would be 28 Not 13 year old girl..... Just saying. Other than the timeline blunder, it's a decent movie. Not Disneys best movies but decent. I like red pandas a lot so a reason why I tolerate the movie. Things sure has changed a lot since I was in jr high school but the bullying and picking on others still looks like it never changed in some cases probably gotten worse.","21 January 2023",4,0,1

This being the case, the main character was a lovely girl who was going through the difficult period of growing up and going through puberty. Didn't we all lie to our parents; didn't we all went through a similar phase; Does that makes us bad people or disrespectful; all those people who deny this part of their lives clearly they have forgotten.

Wall-e was rubbish, because I don't get robots and how they might work.i think it was just aimed at the robot community.

Turning Red, however, was a raucous, hilarious and moving animated film about a 13-year-old human female struggling against expectations, hormones, and conflicting relationships. I also remember the early noughties, so that's ok. I therefore highly recommend it, as it's a wonderful film.","17 April 2022",9,0,3
"Turning Red","It's amazing this movie is still at 7.0 when there are so many people giving it 1/10 reviews, angrily trying drag the score down rather than giving it a reasonable rating.

There are plenty of people calling it ""cringe"", which is exactly what the movie is aiming for. Here's a newsflash: This movie is about 13 year olds.

There was a time when we simply called ""cringe"" childish, and which group behaving in a childish manner is completely acceptable? CHILDREN. For some reason, many people have completely forgotten what being kids is about. Bashing movies depicting children acting their age? Perhaps they should wonder whether it is ""cringey"" for kids to be kids, or for adults to be so sensitive and judgmental of kids' actions when every adult has gone through a cringey phase themselves.","21 April 2022",9,0,2
"Turning Red","Like always Disney does a wonderful job with the animation and getting the message across. Although I would not really play this at school. There is some mature topics that little kids would not get. Which is why I think it should have been pg 13. It's more about girls growing up and figuring out life. I do like the diversity in this film something different. It is also a little wake up call to parents!

They had strengths and weaknesses, made mistakes and learned from them. A story in which the bad guy is an over controlling parent, wow, only Pixar would take such a risk.

Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the backstreets?

"Turning Red","Once again Pixar has made a great film, with a story that will appeal to all, not just girls, although I think girls will be its main audience. It's not without flaws but even they were minimal. It shows you a little bit of what it's like in adolescence because of the hormones that are on the surface, crazy loves and etc..

The storytelling is really well done and detailed generational pressure and trauma in an Asian household. Cringey elements were relatable and flashbacked to those adolescent middle school days.

You will not regret the hour and forty minutes you take to watch another Pixar film destined to become a classic.","5 January 2023",8,0,0
"Turning Red","I cried watching it because any asian can relate to this. The movie is not about period! It is about rebellion and courage and finding your own voice. This movie remind me of another movie, Precious. They both tackled a difficult topic, bringing two sided view on the topic of growing pain and abuse. Love this movie. I'm so glad I watched this movie before I decided how to raise my child, It gave a chance to look at myself and the way my culture from a third person view. If you did not grow in a immigrate family or raised from asian cultures, this is a little hard to relate to it. But it is a movie that still worth to watch.","17 December 2022",10,0,1
"Turning Red","Thought it was a great coming of age movie, appropriate for everyone! The mother and the daughter go through hard times and their relationship grows. Beautiful story.","20 March 2022",9,0,4
"Turning Red","If you are an Asian living abroad and/or where young in the 90ies/2000s then you'll totally relate. The movie is funny and the characters are on point. If you're not Asian then I understand that the characters will seem cliché but actually they are quite accurate. Of course exaggerated but still every ABC will be able to relate :) I found it very entertaining and one of the Pixar movies so far.","1 May 2022",9,0,1
"Turning Red","Was pleasantly surprised with this film. Went in with rock bottom expectations and came away happy. Feel good film for sure but I kinda like that. A nice watch with kids.","19 June 2022",8,0,3
"Turning Red","With a great soundtrack with fantastic characters, this (sadly straight to Disney+) movie is beautifully animated and wonderfully written as a commentary on puberty, growing up, and relationships between a child and their parents as they leave their innocence behind and step toward their life as a teenager.

Will make you laugh and cry 100%","11 March 2022",8,0,1
