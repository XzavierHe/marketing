"So I've stayed at this hotel one time with my girls for a birthday celebration. The rooms were clean and the views are beautiful but the lobby is the most breathe taking view in this building. Walking into the lobby feels like an indoor oasis, greenery and shrubbery every where, wooden logs piled up in a designated area, the main look of this hotel is upscale cabin chic. My main reason for always coming back is the lobby area, I use it as my workspace, meeting space, grabbing coffee with the girls or just bringing my family here for some quiet time, the security and front desk workers are always polite, even the crowd you run into here in this workspace are laid back and low key. If you're staying or just using the space you can grab a bite and neighbor coffee shop right on the first floor, they have an assortment of food and drinks, my go to are the lattes, smoothies and Avocado toast. The lobby lounge where you can grab Lucy and an early dinner, then you have the osprey am upscale farm to table restaurant and the food is always great (reservations are required). There's also a roof top Bar that you can listen to great music while you check out the view of the east river and the city skylines.","10/3/2022"
"I've stayed here twice this year, once in July 2022 and again in September 2022 and both stays were wonderful. I was a little worried at first seeing the reviews on Yelp which are much more critical than on Trip Advisor, but truly, we did not experience anything other than the most hospitable and accommodating service. The views here are amazing. The hotel is right alongside Brooklyn Bridge Park and you can easily walk to all of the piers. And of course, the view of the Brooklyn Bridge is just phenomenal, from the rooms, the rooftop bar, and from walking just a few feet from the hotel. I was able to stay in the Bridge View rooms on the 10th floor and they were amazing! Those rooms, however, are the ones with the clear shower doors, so just a heads up if you're staying with someone you wouldn't feel THAT comfy with. Everyone working here was incredibly friendly and helpful. And valet was very easy and quick for us. During my first stay here, my fiance actually was planning his proposal, and the front desk team not only helped him find a location outside but worked with him to find an even better room for us (which got us to the 10th floor). And because of this, I ended up bringing my Mom here to visit. During this 2nd time, I had actually booked a huge suite thinking another family member was staying with us, and it had been a pay-now/non-refundable room. I was so upset when the family member could no longer go with us, but the reservations folks and the front desk allowed me to downgrade my room and gave me a refund after a few short emails back and forth. The hotel is a little hippy dippy and they focus on recycle and reuse. The metal decor can be a little rusty but apart from this the rooms were clean and comfortable. We thought the food at the Osprey was decent (the parmesan fries are amazing though) but would definitely recommend going into Brooklyn or the city for good cuisine. Some places right near the hotel were great as well like % Arabica and Butler for coffee and pastries, La Bagel Delight a little further out had excellent bagels, and the Brooklyn Ice Cream Factory had awesome ice cream.","9/24/2022"
"If you want to be cheated and treated like garbage,I recommend 1Hotel Brooklyn bridge. This is how our story begins. We live in New York and we planned to celebrate our anniversary in a hotel with a view and pool. The only thing we needed was a nice view and a rest at the pool. We arrived at the hotel at 4:30pm (check in at 4pm) and we were informed that our room was not ready and to come back in half an hour. We waited in front of the hotel for half an hour and after that we finally got to the room we paid for one night. ($890 at the end $1377.67 included just 2 warm drinks, a glass of beer and a mimosa cocktail at the pool the next day). The only person who welcomed us for the whole time at the hotel and wasn't rude was the guy at the front desk. After we left our stuff in the room, we wanted to spend an hour and a half at the pool, which was supposed to be open until 7pm. We arrived at the pool at 5:20pm, the weather was beautiful and one of the employees ( a very rude girl ) told us that the pool was closed because of ""potential rain"" and with the sarcastic words ""safety first"", she turned and left.  What does it mean? Has anyone taught employees to welcome guests or they just know how to say ''safety first'' and don't know what the context is? Since it was hot, we went to the room to wait for the night to enjoy the rooftop. We went to the rooftop as hotel guests at 9:30pm. We sat at a table that was free and after 5 minutes an employee girl ( extremely rude ) came without any question but said that we had to get up because people were waiting to sit at the table. We said that we are guests of the hotel, that we are celebrating our anniversary and politely asked if we could sit anywhere and enjoy ourselves. She said that all tables are reserved and we could just walk around. We found a place to stand, but after half an hour the same rude girl came back to us to tell us there was a group of people who wanted to stand in that place and that we should move 6ft away from them. I need to point out that we were under constant pressure which did not stop during our stay in the hotel. When people started to leave the rooftop at 11:45pm, we sat down at a table to finally take a selfie for our anniversary. There was a lamp on the table that gave light and immediately an employee came to us who moved our phone, took the lamp, told us that the rooftop is closed and we need to leave. We stood up without saying a word and at that moment I saw a man with a beard who I assume is the manager and told him we are the hotel guests who celebrate our anniversary and how the employees are treating us. He had no comment other than ""sorry"".  After that, we went down to the 10th floor to the hotel bar and finally sat down at a table. After that, a manager with a beard appeared with a coworker and told us to go back to the rooftop to take a photo for our anniversary. Thanks but after the whole night of pressure from the horrible employees, we wanted to finally be at the table and spend some time without pressure. The next morning we went to the pool to finally see the pool and enjoy the view. At the entrance was the hostess who just watched us without any welcome and asked if we were guests of the hotel. She saw that we had hotel slippers and towels.  She cheekily said that we can only spend 2 hours at the pool.  We ordered 2 drinks for which we waited 30 minutes. After 30min I decide to ask pool stuff what's going on with our drinks, than be surprised by a group of 4 employees from the pool ( hostess, two guys and one girl ) who jokingly commented on the appearance of the girl who was in the wedding hall with the friends that she is ""ugly and fat"".   After that, a warm beer and a hot cocktail arrived.  The story does not end there. We went to our room after spending two hours at the pool and fell asleep. I will point out that the window in the room is terribly dirty and you cannot enjoy the view shown on the website. I received a call at 1:30 that a late check out of $250 was applied and that we had to leave the hotel immediately. They applied 10 times taxes witch you can see on the photo I posted with this review. After 20 minutes we left the hotel and I will remember this hotel as the worst experience I had in New York.  Along with the worst experience, you can see the bill I paid for the worst night ever in New York. As a positive side, I will praise the guy at the front desk and the staff at the bar on the 10th floor. We did not feel pressure at that bar. Summary: - Room - very dirty window, scratches furniture. - Rooftop - Warm drinks ( minimum 15$ ) , horrible service, rude and unprofessional employees. - Pool - Rude and unprofessional employees, horrible service. - Front Desk - Only staff members who will maybe welcome you. - Bar 10th floor - Good","8/28/2022"
"Right off the Brooklyn bridge park, this hotel is a delight. The lobby is beautiful and luxurious. There is a coffee shop that serves some good coffee and some finger food. The spa is one level below the lobby. Location is just perfect for anyone looking for some R&R","12/19/2022"
"Things started out poorly at check-in. Chaotic, valet took our bags and forgot our extra coats, I grabbed them and walked into the lobby to put them on the cart. A short female desk clerk, spotted me from behind the desk and yelled across the lobby, say 30-40 feet: ""Stay back! I cannot help you until I help this guest."" She pointed to a guy across the lobby fishing through a diaper bag for something. She then pointed to a spot on the floor and said"" You wait here"". Unbelievable, no ""Welcome to the hotel""..""Good to see you""... ""Thanks for coming""..just rude. I wasn't happy with this hotel choice to begin with and left it to my wife to finish check in. Decor: it's like the This End Up, furniture company from the 90's, was commissioned for this effort. Room lighting: the dimmest I've ever experienced. We had to use our cell phone lights to navigate the room at night. Location: fantastic.","12/23/2022"
"We ended up very disappointed with our stay. I notified the property manager and got an apology email but this was unacceptable and I wouldn't recommend spending the money. Please see the attached photos of our disgusting mattress cover and just a sample of the dirt we found in the room. I also notified them that our balcony door was coming off the tracking and difficult to open and close. To top things off, we realized that my daughter left a pair of shoes in the room, and when we went back to retrieve them, we were met with a very unhappy front desk person who added to the poor experience and service. The property is beautiful and in a great location, so If you are ok with spending the money despite the lack of detail or care, it may be worth it. Just take your own linen.","6/30/2022"
"This is a nice hotel . However the beds are super small. I stayed there for a night and I had to leave because it was a best friends trip and the rooms are super tight . It's great if it is only 1 person. Full size beds are a bust. The front desk staff were kind and polite .","12/3/2022"
"I would honestly rate this higher if I could. The location is amazing nestled walking distance to the Brooklyn bridge. So many restaurants that you can walk right over to. The interior of this hotel is amazing. Its the perfect mix of bringing outdoors indoors. The views from every angle of this hotel are amazing!. Super pleased with the front desk staff that assisted during our stay - unfortunately a door broke in the bathroom and they were so quick to provide a solution which the outcome was one night stay for free in a suite. Looking forward to staying again in the near future. If you book here make sure you head to the rooftop for a drink around sunset I promise you won't regret it.","1/6/2022"
"Let me start by saying that this is an absolutely beautiful hotel.  From the cozy lobby, to the scenic rooftop, to the bar with the terrific views, to the stunning modern rooms.  The pictures don't do it justice. So why 1 star then? The reason is that all night long I listened to the twang of elevator cables.  Probably due to the construction of the building (lots of concrete to make it look modern), i was constantly woken up all night long by this twang.  It wasn't super loud, but it was loud enough to be annoying and wake me multiple times.  I was in room 423.  I am telling you that in case you decide to stay there.  If you get this room immediately request a different room.  If you don't then pack ear plugs or your night will be ruined like mine was.  In the morning when i checked out, i told the staff that and their response was ""ok, we'll note a complaint"".  The room was $900 after taxes.  I would expect a little more than that.  Like maybe let me get a manager so you can discuss this with them or ""i'm so sorry to hear that"" or a variety of other responses.  But the person at the desk didn't seem to care and I had to run to catch my flight so I just left without making a fuss.  I suppose that was my mistake.  Lesson learned.","12/6/2021"
"The worst rooftop not worth the hype full of tourists overpriced drink that come in plastic glass and btw you pay 30% tip even if you don't want to it's already billed in your check. Nop not coming back","10/9/2022"
"We stayed at the 1 Hotel Central Park but decided to stop off in Brooklyn for drinks - Such beautiful views of the Brooklyn Bridge and Manhattan. Both hotels are trendy, with an emphasis on plants and the environment. The rooftop bar is a great spot to stop for a drink - Definitely pricey but the views are unmatched. They have a small food menu with a good selection of drinks. The outdoor rooftop bar is closed during the winter - they temporarily move it indoors to the floor below!","12/29/2021"
"Omg I am SHOCKED to see such low reviews on this incredible place. This hotel is my favorite place to stay  EVER (And I've stayed in many nice places around the world). I can't express the joy I feel when I walk into this hotel... it is STUNNING and the staff are such kind, welcoming people! Every time I'm in NYC I try to spend at least 1 night here because it is perfectly situated right on the water, surrounded by a park and with the most AMAZING views of Manhattan. For my birthday last year they upgraded my room to face the Brooklyn Bridge and I just about died... the rooms even have a full floor to ceiling window/door that opens up! If you're thinking about treating yourself to a nice place in Brooklyn, look no further! This is where you want to stay- walkable to everything, beautiful views, good food, easy uber/lyft pick up, etc. I love you 1 Hotel! Thank you for always making me feel at home during my travels :)","10/29/2021"
"We are return customers and stayed 4 nights recently. I give the hotel appearance, rooms, and staff a 5 star, very nice that is why we came back! HOWEVER the internet in our room did not work. We spent 2 days trying to get it going, and had efforts and interruptions to our work and stay as a result. Ultimately, after check out and leaving a note with our concerns, I get a voice mail from a Manager ""Alicia"" and wants to discuss. She leaves the ""general Hotel"" call back, so that was no fun...I tried calling back the next day, she was off. They put me to her VM and I was disconnected. Needless to say, one only has so much time. I guess Alicia was not concerned enough to call me back, or leave a direct contact in the first place. In summary, that part of the Hotel gets a ""zero"" so the average is a 2.5 score, well I rounded down in this case.","10/15/2022"
"Huge plus: accessible rooftop to the public. Incredible view of the entire city skyline as well as an impressive downstairs lobby. The upstairs bar tender was super nice. Wow--this place screams customer service. Definitely took my out-of-towners here to enjoy New York City. They had an incredible time.","9/17/2021"
"Dear 1 Hotel BB, I'm in love with you. I want to live inside you forever. BIG, HUGE shout out to James, DK, Tommy, and I'm forgetting a few more names here for the INCREDIBLE experience y'all gave me. You all deserve a hearty raise! I don't think I'll ever be able stay anywhere else when I come to NYC, even if it is a bit of a trip from Manhattan. The vibes, the experience, the room, everything was a dream. See you very, very soon!","5/25/2022"
"The rooms are beautiful. Amazing decor, great location. However--the service is really lacking. It has a very corporate, impersonal feel, kind of like a Vegas casino hotel. More importantly: I took this trip to NYC with a friend who is non-binary and from a small town where they don't feel comfortable being out. This evening they were sitting on the shared balcony, in a dress (fully covered), reading a book quietly, alone, minding their business and not talking to anyone. Another guest saw them through the window and called security on them without saying anything to us first. Security came and told my friend they had to go inside because they were making people uncomfortable. I understand that the hotel can't predict and ban transphobic guests, but I'm incredibly disappointed that their security team chose to handle it that way. And for that reason, I'd hesitate to stay here again, even though it's very pretty. In short: beautiful building and nice location, but inhospitable on multiple levels.","7/15/2021"
"What a location! The view of the Brooklyn Bridge is incredible and I would highly suggest getting the bridgeview room. It is worth the extra money. Everything about the hotel is top class and I love it here.  The location is also 2nd to none with a bunch of nice restaurants in the area and a lot to see.  Walking the BK bridge and promenade is essential and you will thank me later. I am from the area and I was still impressed! The rooms are very modern and spotless. I really like the filtered water fountain which was very convenient. The bed was also very comfy.  The other surprise was the window opens completely like a door so you can see the view. There is a railing there if you are worried abour safety. This is a pricey hotel but it is worth it.  FYI, the valet is $45 a day.  The service is spot on too with everyone being extremely helpful. I highly recommend.","12/10/2020"
"Beautiful hotel and view, however service is atrocious. Left us waiting hours for our car, our room, and room service. Never greeted us. General manager guy just walking around not doing a thing to see if we need assistance. Lady came and banged on our door at 10AM asking if we were going to leave; checkout as is at 12PM. For the money please go elsewhere. Never booking with 1 hotels ever again. Hali was the girl who checked us in; on her phone the entire time and did not care. Room 908.","2/20/2022"
"This is a beautiful boutique hotel, I'm giving it a 4 star rating because only after I made my reservation did I learn the rooftop bar & pool was closed for guests d/t a private event.  I was on the 9th floor & my room w/ a bridge view was exactly the NY experience I was looking for.  Rain shower head,","6/28/2021"
"This location is God-sent. Wonderful views, huge park, a ferry one minute away, etc. But I believe the staff is not well-trained here. Therefore, they are unable to provide high-class services in accordance with their prices. And the fact that some reviewers mention seeing badbugs in their rooms, just ends any more questions about whether to stay here or not until they completely change their untrainable team and management.","8/29/2022"
"Service was excellent. Everything else not worth the hype. The rooms though aesthetically pleasing lack functionality.","8/23/2022"
"Worn out rooms scratches on the walls, on the mirror on the glass. staff should learn some manners you pay extra for a room with a front view but i didn't got it and no money back also.","11/6/2022"
"Very nice rooftop bar - the views are stunning and the cocktail menu is inventive. I got a reposado espresso martini and appreciated the double upper :) it had me feeling v good lol. A great vibe without feeling pretentious.","12/5/2021"
"The restaurant and spa area and general aesthetic is beautiful. I was in a larger room but not the largest, the room had a cute concept and was on a top floor but it was a little too dated for me. It also takes an engineer to figure out how to use the shower. The hotel is a little too ""hipster"" for me. I personally don't want to reuse my towel after I shower, that's gross. I just want my clean towels,sheets etc every day and I want bottled water not tap.","7/4/2022"
"I came here on Halloween when they waived the minimum drink spend, but it was still $20 to come up to the bar. The views are beautiful - especially at night. You have a great view of the southern tip of Manhattan and the Brooklyn bridge. I didn't really enjoy my time here because you had to pay $100 extra to go behind a rope where people were dancing with the DJ - my $20 ticket just got me access to the bar and part of the views. The music wasn't music you could dance to","11/7/2021"
"Great location if you are looking to explore Brooklyn- located in the DUMBO area it was a nice home base for a few days. The lobby has a beautiful seating area, the concierge was awesome with useful recommendations. The roof top has a lovely view but is VERY young for who is there, I would say a cocktail before you head out if you wanted to grab a sun set up there or a night cap on your way in for the night. Not a place to hang out if you are over 30. The bathrooms are not super private. they are open to the rooms with frosted glass , so they give a semblance of privacy but you can hear every single thing, not to mention if you are there with friends and not a significant other be prepared to not be shy in the shower. you have little privacy, can see your whole outline and more .  Be cool and dont break the rules with thinking you can take a professional camera on top of the roof (this is not allowed, cell phones are fine) and just use your cell phone camera like everyone else. When we checked in there was a client was going nuts screaming at how much he was spending and wanted to use his professional camera on the roof- well tough buddy - there is a reason, not sure what it is but there is one.  Staff was great , rooms were clean and a little larger than i expected for NYC.","10/3/2022"
"My husband and I travel frequently and when we do we like to stay at top rate hotels. We recently had a blast in Williamsburg, so we decided to try the 1 Hotel Brooklyn Bridge. Our choice was an intelligent one. The 1 Hotel is very hip, and very well run. The rooms are beautiful, the lobby is grand, the pool is great, and the rooftop bar is spectacular. We glided in and out without any malfunctions at all. Our concierge helped us avoid any hiccups. Don't hesitate to go, and don't forget your American Express Centurion card. 1 hotel may not be for everyone, but it is certainly for me.","9/6/2021"
"The hotel itself is gorgeous! However the food at the restaurant/bar is HORRIBLE. It is supposed to be an asian-like cuisine. My noodles were dry and when i asked for hot sauce or soy sauce they had neither. The caesar salads do not even taste right. Lastly, the price is astronomical for no apparent reason!","4/5/2022"
"Room AC broken and took 3 calls to get someone up. We returned to find our room door propped open. Both Harriet's rooftop and the ground floor cafe got our orders significantly wrong and took multiple attempts to correct them. It should be noted both places were not busy when this happened. There is still a used tea bag from a previous guest on the floor of our room. I've emailed multiple people on the website and called down for help, but no response has come. If the hotel is reading this, we are in 709 until tomorrow.  Please fix it.","6/10/2021"
"I'll give a 2 for the views and the decor/style.  Service is incredibly bad.  Focus seems to be on instragramable moments rather an actual experience.  The people who work there are nice and just don't seem to know any better.  Whatever values they're trying to portray, they are failing miserably as they appear messy and leave no desire to return.","2/6/2022"
"Amazing hotel room and food!  Can't say enough about this place. Unfortunately have to cut the rating down because of being misinformed at the front desk upon check in and dealing with an uninterested customer service rep after the fact. Make sure you know what you are being charged for before handing your credit card over. They don't explain any charges without specific questions and will take advantage without any proper explanation as they believe their staff is ""properly trained"".","3/23/2022"
"Wedding night ruined. My (now) husband decided to surprise me on our wedding night and book a room at 1 Hotel - a hotel I've always wanted to stay. He called in the morning to confirm the room and ask for a bottle of champagne to be there when we arrived. After checking in, we walked into our room to find that they put us in a room with two double beds instead of the King room we purchased. We went downstairs, still in my wedding dress and him in his suit to talk to the front desk. They said there was nothing they could do and that they overbooked the hotel that night and it was the only room available without downgrading us to a smaller room without a view. We stood there just in awe of the fact that even with calling ahead and confirming they were aware it was for our wedding night, they still had the audacity to give our room away and think it was acceptable to give us a room with two beds. They did offer to refund us half, which was nice. But it still doesn't make up for the fact that one is the most important nights of our lives will always have a damper on it at the end because the people at 1 Hotel didn't have the common courtesy to accommodate somebody's reservation on such an important night.","10/13/2021"
"I had the pleasure of recently booking a private dinner on the 10th floor, catered by the Osprey restaurant. Everything from the food, the killer view, and atmosphere, to the bend over backward service provided by Laura Brown and her team, was awesome. I can't wait to return and book another event!","10/7/2019"
"Beautiful hotel, but more than anything I had very great service. Daryl from security was a highlight. He was very helpful and courteous when I left my laptop there, encouraging me to follow up with him on anything. And to the cleaning staff who found it and returned it. Also, I was greeted in the lobby with glass of wine after a long delayed flight (which I think was prob a wine promotion but nonetheless nice) and had super warm greetings from the front desk. As well, they ran my bags out to meet my Uber when I was in a rush and with my daughter so couldn't leave. All these actions led to a special experience.","6/5/2022"
"I recently stayed at this beautiful hotel for my daughter's 21st birthday and what an amazing experience! I was immediately greeted by Bill who took my luggage to the front desk. What a polite young man! Catherine and Omar checked me in effortlessly and my room was spectacular! A perfect view of the park and Manhattan Skyline with the Brooklyn Bridge to the right. The rooftop restaurant and pool offered delicious food and spectacular views. The absolute best part of my experience was interacting with all of the staff! Everyone and I mean everyone was courteous and simply delightful. Thank you 1 Hotel for an excellent stay!","5/27/2021"
"**Review only based on the rooftop bar/view where we met with some friends and had some cocktails. Rooftop views is so freaking GORGEOUS!!! Definitely be careful if you're an hearty laughter.  I only say this because I am and I totally lost a pair of my Ray-Bans over their balcony... (there may be more to the story but that's not the point of this review! haha)  We did try to go down to the ground to check the bushes but...they are forever lost *whomp whomp*. The groom and bride to be were staying at this hotel and we were invited after hours to have some drinks with them on the hotel's rooftop.  The drinks were pretty pricey (I only know because my husband was telling me to slow my roll with my cocktails. - Can you honestly blame me since it was our first trip away from home and without our baby?)  Like I said before, the view is gorgeous and drinks were a nice touch!  I wouldn't mind staying at this hotel the next time we visit NYC - Brooklyn for fun!","9/14/2019"
"If you appreciate good customer service, this is not the hotel for you. My friends and I nicknamed it beautiful but dysfunctional. Not all the light switches worked. The front desk/concierge didn't answer the phone. You have to request service through the app and there are only 10 options, if you just have a simple question like where is the business center you have to go to the front desk. If you ask for a manager, you get the run around. They placed a hold for the total amount of the suite on my credit card but told me it was just a deposit for incidentals. I have never had that happen before. My friends and I travel frequently, locally and internationally. The lack of customer service, specifically from the from desk, felt personal. Like I didn't meet their qualifications for quality service. Maybe if I had worn Balenciagas instead of Converse? Was it because I'm a woman of color. That was a very unusual and uncomfortable stay. If you prefer luxury and being pampered please stay somewhere else. By the way, I paid $8,000 for my suite but I was treated like I paid $300. After complaining to 4 managers and corporate for 5 days we were given a $200 credit at the cafe. However I prefer good customer service over free food that's why I paid a premium price for a hotel room.","9/6/2021"
"They're racist- tried to go in the other night with a couple brown friends, weren't let in despite white people walking in. Not worth your time.","7/26/2021"
"This review is for the rooftop bar :) I absolutely loved this place! I was able to make a reservation online, with a REASONABLE minimum spend requirement (unlike some places I won't name). Had a great experience from beginning to end. The host downstairs let us skip the line because we had a reservation and go straight upstairs where we were seated immediately and given a choice of tables! Picked one with a great view. We had the frosé and a spritzer drink, both which tasted great (spritzer was strong and the frosé def creeps up on you!). Our fish tacos and truffle fries were delicious. Raemu was our server and she went above and beyond to make sure we were happy, bringing us over an extra table to make room for our food and offering to take photos of us. Now THATS how you treat customers. Will absolutely return :)","6/23/2019"
"Beautiful hotel/decor, excellent location, HORRENDOUS service. From the moment we arrived almost all the staff was either indifferent, incompetent or both. Check in told us our room would be ready ""very soon"" which turned into a three hour wait and breezed right past the actual check in time at 4pm. Went up to the rooftop bar to get a drink while we waited and were greeted by the blank stares of the brain dead host and then the salty bar tender who couldn't figure out how to charge the drinks to the room and gave major attitude about it. Of course they never texted or called us when our room was ready like they said they would. Pool was closed for no apparent reason, some of the restaurants on the property were closed for no apparent reason at random times. Back at the bar on our third night and the salty bartender still couldn't charge anything to the room and still had the same rotten attitude. There were a few exceptions with some decent staff interactions and eventually after various complaints the manager threw us some room service credit but overall this place is not worth the five star prices. Hard to tell if it's due to bad management at the top or what, but something is just off about this place and it is a frustrating bummer to be around their bad vibes.","4/16/2022"
"Beautiful property, but lacking hospitality and for the premium rate this hotel charges, any guest would expect nothing less. We arrived and the front desk staff was not the warmest and honestly felt a little judged walking into the lobby. Room was missing body wash and shower knobs were broken, but just functional enough to get by the one night we stayed here. The room key stopped working in the elevator, I walked to the edge of the front desk where the female made it clear I had to walk to the center of the front desk where SHE was. Again, hospitality. I ordered the açaí bowl in the deli and asked for no honey on it. I watched the barista pour the honey all up in that bowl. I laughed and just decided it just one of those days. Some of the staff were great, but this whole place was a disappointment after dropping 700.00 for one night.","10/14/2021"
"Epic! #1. There is just no other way to describe it. The views were priceless day and night here, both of Manhattan and the Statue of Liberty. This boutique style hotel sits right at Brooklyn Bridge Park and is located in the beloved Dumbo, so a walk around Brooklyn was a breeze. If you have the extra cash you could always take the hotel Tesla into the city. The hotel has options for all you might need, an upscale breakfast place onsite, a full service restaurant, a rooftop bar and a spa. All eco friendly of beautiful woods, metals and concrete. In addition, to keep things fresh, they offer a pop up shop in the hotel lobby. Spiritual Gangster was in the house. If you have the dollars to spend, this is the place to be. We and I have always stayed in the heart of the city due to business and for Broadway. We gave up Hamilton for Brooklyn on this trip, believe it or not the tickets were probably more than the hotel room (and I even have a friend who is a broadway critic). A hard ticket to get, unless you pay full price. Note: Filtered water station and Nespresso machine in your room, a heated bed, and an appropriately friendly staff. As others have mentioned, it will probably be one of the best hotels you can stay in within the US. I would trust their other Hotels are #1 are just as nice, but you cannot argue with the NYC skyline view in one of the greatest cities in the world. #Brooklyn #Dumbo #1HotelBrooklynBridge #ViewsForDays #Epic","11/11/2018"
"Stood here one night for our 16th wedding anniversary, I booked the room over the phone, and customer service was great, the only room available for the liberty room, which didn't really have a view of the city, but did have a view of the Statue of Liberty, and you could see the city if you looked out the sliding door open window. I did see the room cheaper after I stood here on booking.com don't know if it was the exact room, but the prices were significantly lower, maybe next time I shouldn't rush, and do my research. Valet parking is $45 a day, pricey, but what are your options. The men working outside were very nice, helped us in with our bags, and escorted us to the front desk. The front desk staff was very nice, check in was nice & easy. The hotel was beautifully decorated for Christmas, trees all over the place, it also smelled lovely, very woody.... The room was small, but they used the space very well, shower was nice & big, pressure wasn't too great, the soups also smelled like wood, which I didn't like. They do have a water filter that you can fill in a water bottle they leave there, it's all about being green, and not using plastic. Even the water bottles in the fridge were cardboard. They also had a basket to leave unwanted clothes which will be donated, I do love this idea! And wish hotels in the Caribbean did the same. The bed was very comfortable! And everything in the room (lights & heat) are controlled from a iPad on your nightstand. You can also use the iPad to order room service, or request more items in your room (toiletries, towels) Workers were incredibly nice, almost too nice, ever seen the movie ""Get Out"" I felt like I was in it. There was no way that everyone was that well behaved, but I guess with good management it could happen. Check in is 3pm and check out is 12 noon, which is perfect, you don't have to get up too early. Overall it was expensive, but it was our Anniversary, and since we couldn't go ""away"" why not have a stay cation! Would I stay again? Ummmmm maybe for another special occasion, or in the summer when the pool is open.","12/5/2018"
"Great location. Fantastic service. Robert and Diego were first class and alone made the stay terrific. Will book again for my next trip.","6/4/2022"
"The hotel esthetic is beautiful! Rooms are delightful although during Covid aren't being cleaned throughout the stay. Understandable. This is a 3 star hotel at best. Absolutely not 5 star service. The hotel staff is underwhelming, cold, slow and reluctant to help. Overall not professional. To me that is a result of bad training/management. Perhaps hire a company to come In and train all employees on customer service. They also charged our credit card multiple charges over $3,000 for a 3 night stay. When we called the bank, the bank said one of the charges over $1,000 was manually keyed in and not chipped in. I'll let that speak for itself. Watch your charges. The takeaway: The welcoming was cold, (front desk and doorman.) Valet was good, room was beautiful, view was pretty, great location. $16 for a double espresso and nut milk latte in the cafe that included a 20%tip, and again for unfriendly service. The staff needs training badly. Reading past reviews this seems to be a trend. With so many options throughout the city, we won't be coming back or referring anyone in fear of hearing about poor treatment by the staff. The hotel itself is nice, but the staff ruins the overall experience. If you can avoid any human interaction with the door men or front desk, then I'd consider staying here for the atmosphere.","11/24/2020"
"The absolute worst hotel. The staff are so incredibly rude and have no customer service skills. We paid a lot for our room and they refused to let us use the pool. It's a beautiful property but the help really kills the vibe. I would not recommend staying here.","6/21/2021"
"I stayed at 1 Hotel Brooklyn Bridge with my fiancé during our wedding weekend to take advantage of the proximity and views of the Brooklyn Bridge and the city skyline. We splurged for the expensive suite on the top floor for amazing views. Unfortunately that's all this hotel is good for. On the day of our wedding our photographers and videographers came to our room and informed us that the hotel staff said they need a permit to take pictures on hotel property and are not allowed to take any photos or videos. I went down to talk to the hotel staff and they informed me that the sales team was supposed to tell us to get permits. This was never explained to us by the sales team or any hotel staff despite us telling the sales person that we will be here specifically for the photos. The woman at the front desk could not care less and didn't try help us on our wedding day, no free night stay, no comp dinner, not even an apology! Abysmal customer service. The lady at the front desk is just plain bad at her job and needs to be trained at handling these kinds of situations. But it gets worse, after we checked out we tried calling and speaking to the manager to explain our frustration. However, they only cared about who we spoke to on sales and kept forwarding us to different people to speak with and when we finally did get to speak with the manager they said they will call us back, but never did. They never owned up to their incompetence and lack of customer care and service. Every single person we spoke with only made the situation worse.  Just unbelievably bad service, especially for the price you pay to stay here at close to $1500/night. It's clearly a pattern of bad customer service as you can see by the recent 1 star reviews all complaining of the same bad service. DO NOT STAY HERE!","6/8/2021"
"Good day, 2.5 stars. This review is composed on the basis of a single stay. NB: As this hotel is in a desired location with views of Manhattan, riverside decorum and a desirable neighborhood, these are sources of potential bias as they are all location dependent and may considered not to be integral to the function of the hotel and, therefore, location is acknowledged, but will not be considered in this review. First impression: exterior of hotel is clean, austere with contemporary appeal (concrete, glass, steel). Grounds are well kept. Welcome: doorperson was involved with COVID screening.  Very friendly, professional.  Screening techniques are appreciated given pandemic. Lobby: beautiful designed layout with ample space, comfortable sofas, foliage and lighting. Was informed that there would be no one present at the front desk and were informed to wait and someone would present themselves, which occurred in 1-2 minutes. Check-in process: simple. Again, social distancing was recognized. Room: the interior of the room was very interesting, on a corner with views of river and street. At first glance, the interior appeared clean (see below).  With further inspection: -damage to floor (cosmetic) -previous client's key holder inserted in baseboard *** SEE COMMENT BELOW*** -poorly functioning items: 1.  Reading light.  Stuck on strobe effect. 2.  Sliding glass door - difficult to work; required repair within minutes of arrival. 3.  Bathroom - grout was poor and deteriorating (see photo). The color motif of the room is clean and modern; again, with glass, concrete and differential lighting throughout the room(s). The temperature control was very effective. Services: Pool:  N/A Restaurant: not utilized. Breakfast cafe: immediately adjacent; very delicious food prepared with very good service. Clean. Room service: N/A as unavailable. Check out: concerns given to staff.  Was given a small discount on the bill.  The staff person was very apologetic and discussed the ""Image"" of the hotel at length. NOTES: After the stay, I emailed the general manager of the hotel indicating concerns and provided photographic evidence. The response was very friendly, apologetic and that grateful for pointing out the areas for change and improvements. This review, therefore, is composed in this light, as I feel that these are unusual circumstances. In any other time when and where there is decreased concern for public communicable disease, these issues would be taken with the ""usual"" appreciation for wear and tear. However, this is not the usual circumstance.  Unfortunately, the finding of another client's item in the room immediately puts the cleaning and maintenance of this property into serious question. Given the propensity and gravitas of the current pandemic, any finding such as this may give one serious pause regarding the principles to which this property adheres. I am encouraged by the response received; however, I am very concerned as it does nothing for the findings observed.  The pattern is clear and there is an obvious need for change here. Therefore, I have grave reservations with respect to staying at this hotel and would advise it with reservation; these are special times which require special consideration and, in this circumstance, that did not occur. Thank-you for your attention.","12/22/2020"
"The view is awesome and the amenities are decent but the problem is with service. I would say that it's terrible but probably a more accurate word is nonexistent. You cannot reach the front desk from your room. You are connected with reservations. You cannot speak with a human and we had several issues. For example we had a sink that wouldn't drain for both days. Said they would send someone- never did. We finally gave up. For the price customers pay here you expect at the very least decent service and the staff is bare bones and just not in line with the fact they promote themselves as an elite hotel.","6/9/2021"
"The view from this place is amazing. Right above brooklyn bridge park. The food was good. $50. Per person food limit.","7/17/2021"
"Review of rooftop only.... Great views day or night of the Brooklyn Bridge and lower Manhattan.  We had about a 20 minute wait to get up to the roof...I would've waited a lot longer for these views. Staff was very friendly and bartenders very efficient.  We enjoyed a few drinks, took a few pictures and were on our way. Note - this spot is a deceptively long walk from the bridge - be prepared to walk but....bring a camera!","6/25/2018"
"Worst experience ever. No spots in restaurants, lounges and pool. Why overbook if you can't offer accommodations use to everyone? As someone said all tables empty and have signs reserved so that you won't be able to sit there. I guess you have to pay extra to be able to even eat. Because almost $500 a night isn't enough to allow you to eat. Needless to say we found some bites on our body and a few days later found bed bugs home!  Never did we have them before. Ohh and 50$ minimum at the lounge area is just ridiculous. There is no food choices even available. Menu is just terrible. You want to charge? You have to offer first.","9/21/2020"
"Booked the skyline suite with an amazing view of manhattan and the Brooklyn Bridge. Love the eco-friendly theme of this hotel. The suite, gym, and lobby was clean and they checked the temperature of everyone who entered the hotel, in addition to the mask requirement. Extra points for being dog friendly (no size limit). Will be coming back with my dogs.","1/4/2021"
"Love love love EVERYONE is kind and welcoming. Beautiful space. Thank you Kat with a K for your wam welcome and Diego for your help. Alicia was helpful as well, lost my key and gave me one right away. Door man was such a gentleman. Literally the whole staff made me feel good and that's priceless. I will be back again. Hotel is amazing very therapeutic , can't wait to come again. Peace and love","3/2/2021"
"I've been meaning to write a review based on my experience back in august. I decided to finally treat myself and my friends and spend a night to celebrate my birthday. The staff initially were very welcoming and the interior of the lobby and our room were modern and stunning. We had a beautiful view that was to die for. My friends and I are native NYers and highly anticipated to tan by the pool. I was so upset to find out once we got up there that it was full and I had to make a reservation earlier in the morning. We checked in at 3pm and by then clearly we had no chance. The pool staff told us he would let us use the pool but that's it. Mind you the pool itself was extremely small considering we are suppose to socially distance. We figured okay why not just enjoy the rooftop bar. NOPE they require $50 minimum a PERSON just to sit up there. Eventually We didn't feel comfortable so we went back to our room and twiddled our thumbs. I was so so upset that I spent money just to experience almost nothing. The lack of transparency is what bugged me the most. Had I known I would've not booked a room to be honest and just had dinner by the water. I left a review with the hotel themselves and the manager emailed me some computerized response that did not really acknowledge my concern or disappointment but just restated the obvious about their pool policy. I don't think I'll be coming back just due to the fact that i pay to not have the full experience. They pretty much made my birthday a downer.","10/8/2020"
"Review only for the bar/rooftop experience. We were here at the end of January 2020. I came here with my friend right after moving to NYC. It was my first day in the city and we wanted a rooftop view to celebrate. THIS VIEW DID NOT DISAPPOINT! Jaw dropping. Dare I say, the best in Brooklyn? Our server, Meg, was EXTRAORDINARY and very sweet. She really went above and beyond for us!! She definitely made my first day in the city extra special. 1 Hotel BB, you have a jewel in her! This rooftop + bar is now on my short list to bring everyone I know!","6/9/2020"
"I chose to celebrate my birthday dinner with 1 Hotel Brooklyn after I'd heard others share positive experiences. Unfortunately, from the very beginning, there were numerous red flags that culminated in disaster. I get upstairs to the bar and I'm stopped at the door. Not greeted, but stopped and asked for my reservations. The host then proceeds to say I need a card on file and informs me and my guests of the minimum amount that needs to be spent per person. My card was already on file from my online reservations I had previously made. My guests and I were then seated on a small couch with a little coffee table. My reservation was for 8; this arrangement did NOT comfortably fit 8 people and their drinks and food. The waitress was very nice, but she and one bartender had to service the entire bar all by themselves, which was filled to its maximum occupancy. We all ordered drinks and appetizers. There was a very long wait - more than an hour. We never received the drinks, and once the appetizers came out, service completely stopped for us. My guests had to go up to the bar, individually re-order their drinks, and pay for them at the bar. We were ready to leave at this point so we requested the check. When it came, the amount was not correct. It included SEVERAL drinks that we were never served. I asked my one Caucasian friend who was seated with us to go and talk to the manager to point out the error and explain how my guests paid at the bar (and had met the per-person minimum.) She does, and when she returns to our tiny couch she lets us know he said it was ""fine."" When I go to pay the bill since my card is already on file, I am told I must pay the full incorrect amount. I ask for the manager and he tells me there isn't a manager. I am then cornered by the maitre d' who pressures me into buying a bottle. At this point the manager finally decides to make himself known. A little too late for that, buddy. He points at the bottle and says ""you can just take it home,"" then he calls a bodyguard to walk me out! At the time, I was too shocked to react at all, and I left. Every step of my birthday ""celebration"" with 1 Hotel represented a complete and utter failure in customer service. I am hurt because I know my white counterparts that were seated at the larger tables around me did not have the same experience. I wasn't going to share this, but as a black person who has been racially profiled before, it still cuts me to my very core.","4/8/2021"
"My hotel friends had been talking about this Sternlicht hotel in Dumbo so I finally had a staycation here. I love the eco-friendly design, its amazing that you are in NYC and can feel so removed when you step into the hotel, very relaxing. The live greenery everywhere you look complimented by wood and industrial finishes tie everything together aesthetically. The views of the city are hard to beat and theres a couple well-curated bars/eateries in the lobby. The service is on point. Everyone we interacted with during our stay, front staff, room service, housekeeping, concierge were pro and pleasant to deal with. Room size is perfect, waterfall shower, potable water dispenser, lighting, very impressive. Protips, the hotel's late night room service menu is surprisingly good. Goes way beyond standard generic caesar salad or burger and fries. Watch your fingers when you open the fridge, might hit side wood panel. All in all a great place, the top rec to friends when they visit the city now.","3/21/2018"
"The hotel is beautiful, interior design is incredible and you cannot beat the views/location. But, their staff/unorganized manner dampened our experience quite a bit. A few things to note (capacity is due to Covid-19): 1. If you want to spend time at the pool- you have to get up at 6:30am, so you can be in line at 6:45 to make a reservation for lounge chairs (you will need a reservation to use a lounge chair at any time during the day). If you don't have a reservation, you CAN still swim, but the max capacity in the pool area is 35 people and there are 20 chairs. So only 15 people without chairs can be around at any given time. BUT- if you schmooze and love up to the guys running the pool area- you'll have a better chance of getting in.. not a good system. 2. People are allowed to reserve multiple time slots at the pool. So, one group can be around the pool for 6 hours- while others staying at the hotel may not be able to swim at all.. 3. If you want to even sit in the rooftop area- they require you to spend $50 per person, not a big deal if you plan to eat and drink. Well.. it was $50 per person one time we asked, then it was $75 per person, then it was $100 per person.. even if you're staying at the hotel. There didn't seem to be any actual rules set and the price changes seemed very random. The hotel staff definitely play favorites and if you're staying in a suite or spending ""enough"" money your experience will 100% be wonderful, they will bend over backward for you. But, if you're just in a typical room (like we were), don't plan on them going out of their way to help you. At one point, as we stood in line hoping to get into the pool, a hotel employee came up to the employee in charge of the pool area and said ""make sure this group gets anything they need, we want them to have a great experience""- referring to a completely different group than the ones that had been patiently standing in line trying to access the pool all day. That's not something I would ever suggest staff say in front of other guests. Don't get me wrong, we were able to enjoy our time at the hotel. We did end up being able to spend time at the pool and enjoy the atmosphere, we just really had to figure out the system to make it happen.","8/2/2020"
"Booked this hotel for a staycation for 2 nights and 3 days. Summary of pros. There were a couple of good pros in the sense that they had limited capacity at the pool area (due to social distancing measures) and cleaned the lounges every 2 hours. The room we had was very clean and loved the views. The staff was friendly- nothing too out of the ordinary. There was a restaurant and a coffee shop at the lower floor which was great for any late night munchies and/or breakfast treats. We were able to bring up food to the pool area so that was great. Pros listed: - Social distancing was pretty standard - Everyone wore masks - Staff was friendly - TV had chrome cast/bluetooth capabilities - Rooms were very clean - Rooftop was wonderful Summary of cons. Okay- so for the most part and as a travel/leisure industry trying to work out the kinks of operating during a pandemic, it was overall a good experience. However, I had to take 1 star off due to the following reasons: Cons listed: - Hotel never told you that you had to reserve lounge chairs for the pool area. Guests can stay in the pool for as long as they want but if you want to reserve a lounge chair you'll have to go before 7 AM to do so. Each reservation is only for 2 hours. - In order for you to stay at the rooftop area (even as a guest) you would have to spend at least $50. My friend and I were spoken to by the hostess and the waiters/waitresses for sitting in the area for about 10 minutes while we waited for the pool staff to clean the lounge area. MIND YOU. There would be no one at the pool and they would be asking you to not sit there and that they have ""reserved"" tables. Okay... I know this is complete BS and you're just trying to get us to spend more money to make up for the pandemic but seriously? You're trying to nickel and dime your hotel guests that are already paying AT LEAST $400 per night? Overall- it's okay whatever.","8/4/2020"
"They charged my credit card for an amount they are not supposed to do over $600 and  if I didn't check my bank account they will never tell me. I am really upset with this situation.","12/2/2020"
"3 stars for the views. We loved 1 hotel in Central Park so much we decided to change our Airbnb in Brooklyn to the 1 hotel Brooklyn bridge... we had high hopes. Unfortunately restaurant was rude & did not treat us like guests at the hotel we ended up leaving after 25 minutes of being unattended or greeting at our table. Staff was not friendly throughout the hotel. Again views were AMAZING. In a great location! Quick walk to so many restaurants.","11/1/2020"
"This is the best rooftop bar view in all of New York City. Verily, the sights of the bridges, East river, the skyline and the street below are a sight to behold. As to the bar itself: really nice! Its trendy with a restaurant, and a pool area for reserved parties and guests. The space for regular patrons isn't the biggest but its enough. What really surprised me was how chill the environment was. A hotel like this could easily charge a cover, or mandate a dress code. Surprisingly, it wasn't at all pretentious: diverse crowd with people wearing what they like. Moreover, the drinks were made well, I enjoyed my dark and stormy. Only issue is that the drinks are pricey, but understandable considering its a hotel of this capacity and pricing. This place was pretty sweet, I would go back.","8/12/2017"
"One word: STUNNING. If you're a hotel guest: Stayed overnight and the views were amazing. There is a sliding door to open up for fresh air and view the city/bridge. The rooms have many bathroom amenities and different lighting settings. Besides the usual robes/soaps, they also have makeup mirror lighting, cotton swabs and shower caps- oh and we had a hammock! Absolutely loved that the lobby by the elevators had baskets of fresh fruits and lemonade. Rooftop: Everyone has access to the rooftop. Drinks are on point and all refreshing especially Summer Supply which is watermelon and tequila. Need I say more? Pool: Only hotel guests have access to the pool but if you are one, please make a quick stop here before leaving! The water is warm, views are awesome and you can order drinks whether in the pool or getting your tan game on. They also have free cucumber/lemon infused water.","8/31/2019"
"Nice place to hangout and drinks. Enjoyed the Broklyn bridge and Manhattan city view. $20/ Each to enter the rooftop.","8/17/2019"
"I loved this hotel. If possible I would rent one of the rooms to live in. Once I'm ready to purchase a house or condo, I'm going to instruct the designer to make it exactly like the Liberty Rooms in 1 Hotel Brooklyn Bridge. After staying here two times, I'm going to wholeheartedly say that Hotel 1 Brooklyn Bridge is my favorite hotel to this date! Another awesome perk for guests that I have to mention is that if you need to commute within 3 miles of the hotel, you can get a free ride in the hotel's Tesla. The ride alone in a $90K+ Tesla is an experience on it's on. If you're staying here, take advantage of it. Location: 5/5 The hotel is right on the water and affords AMAZING views of the Manhattan Skyline. There's a bunch of restaurants in walking distance including Shake Shack and a solid pizzeria. Decor: 6/5 I stayed in the Liberty King room and pretty much fell in love. It was modern with USB plugs, super functional and just the industrial style I like. Cleanliness: 5/5 Pristine. Super clean and swanky. Service: 5/5 All the staff is top notch. I've never run into any of the cleaning staff but the front desk staff are friendly and accommodating. I've even gotten a complimentary upgrade on my first stay here. Hotel Amenities: 5/5 Everything is nice and brand spanking new. The industrial yet natural and green (environmentally friendly) style flows throughout the entire decor of the hotel. Even the elevators are swanky. The Rooftop Bar: 5/5 The rooftop deserves a review on its on. It affords an even better view than the liberty rooms. You can see the Statue of Liberty and get a really great panoramic picture of the NYC skyline. Price: 5/5 Expensive but worth it! Especially if your company is fronting the bill. :-) ... In all honesty though, the price is comparable to similar high-end hotels in the area and in city.","8/9/2017"
"Probably the best rooftop view in Brooklyn. Their cocktails are hit or miss though. At $17 a pop, I expected them not to be served in plastic cups, and for them to actually put some effort into the presentation. The Smash was the better of the two cocktails I tried. The other was the Poolside, which lacked any punch. Waitstaff was amazing. They went out of their way to accommodate our large group by moving chairs around. Wish there was more umbrella covering though, as half our group was sweating bullets with the sun directly above us at mid-day. Didn't try much of the food, but did sample the fried mochi bites, which was definitely unique. They also do more substantial things like a $25 lobster roll, $14 burger, or $8 hot dog. So basically, 5 stars for the views and staff. And 3 stars for the bar program.","8/14/2017"
"My boyfriend and I are celebrating my birthday over the Labor Day weekend. We booked Brooklyn bridge view for 2 nights. After we get our room, it's water view (at a lower price which is around $200 less than the room we booked) Manager said the card was declined the first time when we booked the room. when they tried again, no more bridge view room available. First of all, we didn't know that before we come. Second and most importantly, if we don't mention we got the wrong room, hotel didn't mention it at all when we checked in, and we are paying 2 nights bridge view rate. They agreed to refund the difference for the first night, and move us to bridge view room on the second day. Shouldn't they mention that when we check in?! Plus, we mentioned it's my birthday. They didn't say anything about this mistake or anything for the birthday. Usually hotels at the price range, I'm expecting something like a happy birthday card at least. My friend got a complimentary upgrade for her birthday ( not even on the exact day ) when we went to palm spring. Anyway, very disappointed and will not come back again","9/3/2021"
"I am a resident of Brooklyn; therefore, it stands to reason I will most likely not require a stay at this gorgeous hotel. HOWEVER, I have visited the rooftop many times and hung out in the lobby and was always welcomed as though I were a visiting guest/tourist. The rooftop alone is worth a visit for nowhere else can you capture the beauty of the stunning bridges and the Manhattan skyline all lit and looking so dazzling. Great addition to Brooklyn Bridge Park. I am sure guests enjoy their stay here.","9/20/2017"
"This hotel has major problems. It is very poorly run and way overpriced for what you get in the way of services. And their bookkeeping is very screwed up. Be careful if you should stay there. To start out, when we got into our room, the air conditioning was malfunctioning. After two attempts, that finally got repaired. The room also had no wash cloths to use in the shower. And the room lighting left something to be desired. As to the bookkeeping issues, see below. My wife and I attended a wedding for a relative there on June 19th. And the groom's family had arranged to have all the billing for the room's stay as well as the fee for parking and other incidentals paid by them. When we checked in, we were told that all expenses had in fact, been taken care of by our family member. When we checked out, we were told that the hold on our credit card for incidentals had been released, and that no money was due. One week later, we came to discover that about $700. was in fact charged to our credit card. So be very careful when you get you bill from them. And good luck in terms of the facilities being properly maintained. I would not make that my first choice if I were going to be in the area in the future.","6/25/2021"
"JC the hotel manager was beyond helpful and accommodating. Looking forward to returning for another experience.","12/4/2021"
"Disclaimer: I DID NOT stay at this hotel, I only came for the rooftop. However, I would gladly stay at this hotel for the experience you'll have on the rooftop. To be honest, I saw this rooftop bar on Instagram and decided to give it a shot since the views looked absolutely stunning. When I got to the top I couldn't have been happier with my choice to try it out. Here's the rundown, be expected to wait in line at least 20 minutes on the ground floor if you're coming on a weekend night. I waited about 20 minutes after arriving around 7:30 on a Saturday evening in the summer. My friends who came about an hour later weren't so lucky. They waited about 40 minutes before trying a different entrance that allowed them to go up instantaneously. Once there you pretty much have uninterrupted views of the Brooklyn Bridge, downtown Manhattan and Brooklyn Bridge Park. The rooftop is encased in a glass enclosure which assures constant views even if your sitting away from the edge. Arriving almost right before the sunset almost assured that it would be crowded (which it was) but if you're strong enough to brave it until you're guaranteed to find a good spot on the enclosure to snap a picture without anyone in your way. The drink prices were reasonable too! All beers on tap were only $8 and the choices for cocktails were pretty extensive as well. This is a great place to come with friends who are visiting the city and want a good time without the craziness of a rooftop bar in Manhattan. Great customer service, wonderful atmosphere and beautiful views make this a must if you're looking for a good time in downtown Brooklyn.","7/31/2017"
"The hotel was definitely amazing. The ambiance. The view. The room was huge. The rooftop was beautiful. But what they lacked was customer service! We were given a room late. So as a courtesy the manager gave us a suite and let us check out late, which I think was great. But it's just probably communication with staff. They don't even let us know food are not gonna go up and we have to pick it from the lobby if we order delivery - I have to call them. And checking out,  we're supposed to check out late at 3pm because that's what they promised to us, but coming back to the room, they already removed our key access at 1pm. So we have to wait again for us to be accommodated and let us in.  ‍","7/30/2020"
"Had 2 good tasting drinks ,enjoyed the view and atmosphere then headed to our fav spot.","9/9/2020"
"This is the first hotel I've stayed in where I wouldn't mind staying inside the hotel the whole trip vs. exploring. They nailed their goal of bringing the outdoors inside with lush greenery everywhere.  The staff was super friendly and walked us to our room. They may have walked us up and stayed a little too long but such a minor detail. The room itself had a beautiful view of the Brooklyn Bridge and River. If you're staying here, you may as well pay a little more to get the view since it's amazing to wake up to. We stayed during December and I'm honestly dying to go back during the summer so we can take advantage of the rooftop and pool. Our room was clean and everything was so cozy from the bathrobes to the bed. I loved the use of moss instead of a plant in our bathroom. If you're looking to splurge on a weekend trip in NY this is the hotel to stay at. I believe there's 1 Hotel by Central park but I'd probably prefer to stay at this one.","1/12/2020"
"GLORIOUS... I've been hanging out at this hotel since its opening and I have nothing bad to say. First let's talk about the architecture and ambience...absolutely glorious! Whenever I want to get work done sometimes I come here and hang out in the space provided for the locals. This place is very neighborhood friendly. I've also been to the spa which you have to visit at least once. The restaurants here is pretty good and the different venues inside the hotel is good as well. The views and the customer service is so on point. The view alone is 10/10. One of the very few places in NYC that I don't mind doing a little staycation in.","1/26/2019"
"At the current time, as of October18, 2021, the hotel staff and patrons are not wearing masks in any of the indoor public spaces. They do not ask for proof of vaccination upon check in. Proof of vaccination is required for the gym, bar and restaurants. Rooms are very small. Room service menu very limited but it was fast. Aesthetically pleasing hotel. Bed was very comfortable. Good location in DUMBO. If they adhere to CDC indoor mask guidelines and ask for proof of vaccination upon check in I would raise the rating to 3 stars.","10/20/2021"
"This hotel is totally going downhill. The people at the front desk have attitude. They won't extend basic courtesies like phone chargers. It feels touristy and transient here. I would not go here if you're looking for something tranquil.","7/6/2021"
"We had a great stay here this weekend! There were a few glitches but the hotel handled it in a very professional manner and for that reason, I would recommend this hotel. The first night my husband and I stayed there, our neighbor through the wall was very drunk and very upset and kept us up all night yelling. We had to call the front desk at 3:15am to notify them about the noise and got no sleep. They sent up a security guard up to rectify the situation and it immediately stopped. In the morning we received a text from a woman named Mary apologizing for the noise and asking if there was anything she could do to make out stay more comfortable. I  really appreciate the customer service in this circumstance. While it was not the hotel's fault this woman was very loud that night, they proactively took responsibility for the issue. They were also very accommodating for our request for a late check out. Thank you!","9/8/2020"
"My husband and I always stay at the 1 hotel in Miami when we travel there. With many FL trips cancelled due to COVID, we traveled to the 1 Hotel Brooklyn Bridge location twice in the past month and a half. Upon our first stay, we were welcomed and taken care of by Robert at the front desk. I am HUGE on customer service and cannot rave more about the level of service and detail Rob provided during our stay. He always checked in to make sure we were ok and gave recommendations on where to eat in the area. Prior to us leaving during our first stay, we told Rob that we would hands down be back with our children to enjoy another great stay with the hotel and all of the amenities it had to offer. A few weeks later, we were back! It felt immediately like home! We had decided to come up a day earlier as our power was out at home due to the tropical storm that had come through. Upon our arrival, with lots of luggage, our three boys AND our puppy, we were taken care of. Now, you can imagine how stressful the few days prior had been with operating with no power at home with young children, puppy and bouncing around. The suite we had was phenomenal with the view of the BKLYN bridge, Manhattan AND Statue of Liberty! Our kids fell in love with the view and felt right at home - they even made friends at the rooftop pool on their first day! 1 Hotel is naturally a go-to for us now. A quick two hour drive and we feel like we're in paradise. I want to give a very special shout out to Rob for his graciousness, attention to detail and always making sure our family was ok during our stay. 1 Hotel IS home for us and we will be back time and time again!! More shout outs go out to the following: Korey! This man is so polite, patient and caring! He's always smiling and you can definitely tell he loves what he does! Larry and Yago: Everyday during our stay they made sure our family was OK while at the pool and let the kids stay in as long as they wanted, (Kids have to be kids, right!?) even when we weren't occupying pool chairs. Sebine: so kind, attentive and has an infectious smile!","8/17/2020"
"being a ""cool"" and ""trendy"" hotel does NOT make it okay to have terrible service. i would give this hotel 1 star if the location wasn't amazing. can't beat the views. however, the service here is terrible and you will feel like an inconvenience the staff if you make any requests. the service at this hotel is horrible and slow on top of that. we actually had a precious guests CLOTHES in our room when we checked in. then when we moved rooms due to numerous other issues (AC not working, windows wouldnt close, too noisy on our floor, TV not working etc) they packed that stranger's clothes into our zipped up and packed suitcases and sent them to our new room. also, the pool booking system is ridiculous and you'll be lucky to get a spot as it is tiny. but again, can't beat the views.","6/1/2021"
"Lovely place! Some what friendly staff! Love the fresh fruits by the elevator at the lobby!","8/17/2018"
"The place is exciting, the drinks, food and this amazing view is one hell of an experience....I was here with friends for a birthday party....","12/18/2019"
"I came here for drinks on the rooftop and I must say this place is gorgeous. The cocktails are expensive but they are nicely made. This is a great date spot as the view will be sure to impress. The bartenders were ""okay."" At one point he made us a specialty drinks and the glasses were only half full. We approached him about it and he seemed a bit annoyed that we were asking why a drink thats about $15 was only half way full. We could tell he didn't want to but he ended up filling the glasses up. I thought that was pretty rude as there was about 10 of us and we were definitely spending money. If you like tequila they have some aged bottles that you can take a shot from but be ready to pay the price. Overall this place is wonderful to have a nice drink and relax I would definitely come back in the summer. *side note: My friend had a room here for the night and the room was really nice. The view was spectacular and the building is very ecofriendly  just as Brooklyn Bridge Park is.","3/31/2018"
"I simply had one of the worst hospitality and service related incidents at the 1 Hotel that I can remember. I visited Harriet's (The Rooftop Bar), went to the bar, ordered a drink and started a tab. Shortly after, my friend made it to the bar as well and put a drink on my tab as well. We enjoyed them well enough and after some time  went to close out my tab. Here is where the problem started - There was no tab open any longer.... After searching for my card, we find out the bartender had somehow let some other (still unknown) person close out my tab, without confirming they were Alan (me), and even gave them my credit card. Already bad enough, it seemed the unknown card snatcher put additional drinks on the tab and put a $30 tip on the tab before closing and taking the card. I immediately called my credit card and canceled it and luckily no other charges made it on. The bartender apologized, promised me he'd void the check and even gave us a free drink to boot, but I had a feeling they check wouldn't actually be voided. I asked if he could produce the receipt and he told me ""its already been voided, you don't have to worry about it"". I insisted and he produced the paper receipt with the fraudulent signature. I snapped a picture and figured all ended up turning out okay with a decent story to leave with... until I checked my Chase account a week later and the full amount posted to my credit card - fraudulent drinks + tip and all. I called in immediately, gave hotel employee the backstory + details and she told me that only a manager could help me and they were ""on the floor"". She said to try back later.... I tried back later and same thing (she told me that only managers can decide when to take calls. To her effort she told me she'd leave a message and a manager would call me back. A day passes and nothing... I call back and its the same employee and this time they were able to track down a manager and she conveys that the manager promises me they'll call me back before end the day.... and nothing. Over a 10 day period this phone tag between me calling Hotel bar and the management team not calling me back, until eventually having to call and get my bank involved. To this day, ~a month later, not a single representative of the 1 Hotel has gotten back to me and I've now had to get my bank involved. I work in the travel industry and been to similar spots all around the world have never experience the lack of concern, urgency or care that the 1 Hotel Brooklyn Bridge showed. I'll never be back and would suggest you skip to the many other great hotels + rooftop bars in Brooklyn.","8/3/2019"
"I booked a room at 1 hotel for Monday August 3rd mainly for the pool and to have somewhere to celebrate my bestfriends birthday. When I spoke to the front desk over the phone the guy was very pleasant and even offered an early check in so we can decorate the room. He also told us that we would be able to have access to the pool before we checked in if the room wasn't ready. Upon arriving at the hotel we split up so 2 of us could decorate and the other 2 could put our names on the list for the pool. When we reached the rooftop it was a black guy sitting on one of the couches saying he's been waiting since the morning to get into the pool, we just figured maybe he was exaggerating. We was greeted by the host and was told that they would be clearing the pool out in a few and that we would be able to get in after that. We was told to go change and come back at 4pm so we did, once we came back to the pool the same ppl were inside and the same black guy was STILL waiting. At this point 2 black ladies was complaining to to the host about waiting to get access to the pool and was being brushed off saying they was at capacity. Once they left I approached the same host who told us to come back, he told us they was at capacity to try coming back in the morning. I explained that we mainly got the room for the pool and that it would be raining the next day so we wanted to be able to enjoy the pool today. He then told us to take a count so we could see that it was 35 ppl in the pool and that it would be a fire hazard to allow more people in. I noticed a group of Dominicans in the pool that was originally waiting before we got there and they even had a few extra friends with them. The host suggested that we stick around and see who comes out so we could then take turns in the pool, that wasn't what we expected to hear at all. He then said he would allow us to take turns taking pictures in the pool but we wouldn't be able to stay inside. We tried to get a table so we could drink while we wait but they wanted $50 per person just to sit down which didn't make sense to us since we already had food and liquor in the room we paid for. So now my 4 friends and I are standing there in our bathing suits just waiting around to see if anyone would be leaving the pool so we could go in, no luck. I then went asked to speak to a manager, a short guy comes out with an attitude screaming that the pool is no closed and no one else would be able to get in. We was told there would be 2 hour intervals for the pool which closes at 7pm and at that point it was 5pm. He never came over to me so I decided to go to the front desk, at this point it was 2 people downstairs making a complaint. I was approached by the manager and explained all what happened, she told us that unfortunately there wasn't anything she could do to get us into the pool and that we should try back in the morning or she would refund us for our resort fee. I asked her how is it that they told us it's 2 hour intervals for the pool but the same people that was in it before we went got back in and people that was waiting for hours was still waiting while a new set of people went in. I told her it seemed discriminatory and she went off saying I'm putting words in her mouth. We decided to say forget the pool and just enjoy the room and the rest of the hotels amenities. Unfortunately we couldn't even do that because we was told all the restaurants was closed and that we couldn't get room service either. We decided to take pictures in the lobby where we was approached twice about putting our masks on when we only had it off for the pictures. A group of about 7 white people were sitting in the lobby and only 1 of them had on a mask. We brought this to the attention of the 2 people who approached us, 1 ignored it and the other went over and said a few words and left. They still didn't put any masks on and at that point we decided to go back to the room so we wouldn't be harassed any further. We decided not to stay overnight because the excitement of it was gone at that point. It was all very disappointing seeing how much we paid for the room and how much we was looking forward to it. I would have to give this hotel 2 stars and that's only because of the view on the rooftop and the decor inside.","8/6/2020"
"If you are of color prepare to be harassed and excluded! I have NEVER been treated in such a way. This place is absolutely beautiful and I wanted to love it but the way my friends and I were treated was absolutely unacceptable. Check-in was as expected, temp check at the door and very friendly. Get to the room, beautiful room. Time for the pool, you must sign in to reserve a spot.... well let me just say don't waste your time on signing up if you are black or Hispanic. We signed for a spot, waited on line and told them we have a slot and the guy was like ""you can't go in because they're at full capacity"" which was 30 ppl. He then proceeded to say ""You can count if you like..."" as if trying to be funny and failed so I took it as he was being sarcastic. I could be wrong since I don't know the man personally so I give him the benefit of the doubt... while my friend is talking to the guy about our time slot another black man waiting off to the side said that HE has been trying to get into the pool as well with NO LUCK. My friend was able to get in to only take pictures but we couldn't stay. There was 5 of us and 3 was allowed to take pictures and it literally took us 3-5 mins... anyways we were told to come back in an hour so we did just that. An hour later we returned the SAME people are in the pool. We were told ""No one else is allowed into the pool"" mind you we were the only one's waiting to get in again... now at this time my friend asked to speak to a manager so another man came to enforce that ""no one else is allowed in"" in other words that WE weren't allowed in there was still an hour left till the pool closed... now we go speak to the manager and she was definitely not helpful and kept saying something about ""regulations""? Which wasn't making sense because what was the point of a time slot if you are not going to enforce it. We counted the pool as a lose and decided to try and enjoy the rest of our stay. Now we all got dressed to head out for dinner but it rained heavy so we decided to take pictures in the lobby since we were already dressed up. All of us wearing our mask come to the lobby and started taking a few pix, three of us are sitting down discussing what we should order to eat since due to covid there is no room service available which is understandable so the friend who is talking has her mask pulled down. A Caucasian hotel employee told us that we needed our mask on if we wanted to be at lobby while holding a box of mask to offer one if we did not have one, understandable until he turn back around and left failing to tell the other group of all Caucasian people to put their mask on... no exaggeration NOT ONE OF THE CAUCASIAN PEOPLE HAD THEIR MASK ON... This is where I had enough.. I walked to the desk and asked if the guy can come back and tell the group of CAUCASIAN people right next to us to PUT THEIR MASK ON AS WELL. The Caucasian man did not return however, a black man did show up and told the group to put on their mask (which they did not comply fully) then the employee came to me and said  ""sorry about that ma'am"" my experience had truly been ruined thanks to the treatment of this establishment NEVER and I mean NEVER will I recommend this place to anyone. Having some services such as no room service and no house keeping is understandable due to Covid but this has nothing to do with that this has everything to do to how we were treated as paying guest. AVOID THIS PLACE.","8/4/2020"
"They have bed bugs so BEWARE !! We ended up finding a bed bug in our room and went to complain to the manager Mary. The way we were handled about the room situation was absolutely terrible. Mary told us the hotel never had this issue before and basically made it seem like we were the problem. She ended up accommodating us with another room which took about 2 hours. After getting settled in the new room we ended up finding ANOTHER bed bug. I would never stay at this place again !!!","7/21/2020"
"I have been meaning to do a review on this hotel. I had the opportunity to stay here during my conference and this was very trendy chic. The keys are wooden chip size sensors which I lost, everything is reclaimed or refurbished very environmentally and eco friendly. In the room they have filtered water faucet, they offer socks for slippers. It had a hipster type vibe, I had a great view from my room and it was shared patio area once you step out your sliding door. The only thing for me was the fact that they didn't have very much food options. The cafe had 3 main items and the other restaurant is only open for dinner. Room service didn't have very much of a choose either. Although I loved their chicken avocado salad. Would I stay here again YES! I can always walk down the street a block to get some bomb pizza lol","4/22/2018"
"Ate at the Osprey but this review is for the bathroom. To get to the bathroom you have to take an elevator or stairs  a flight down and then try to figure out which door it is !! Ok, so now you've figured it out ( has WC on door) it's gender neutral which I'm still getting use to ( men and women in the same bathroom) but you have a pricey hotel and only 2 sinks work with nothing to indicate which are the ones that do; one hand blower available ( other had a pail in the way so you couldn't stand directly in front of it ) AND ...the smell of the bathroom was revolting.  What a turn off and disgrace especially for such a high end hotel. To the owners: Put a CLEAN,  FUNCTIONING  bathroom on the main floor where the restaurant is, you cheapos!!!!","9/2/2019"
"Staff is friendly and helpful. I definitely enjoy my stay at the hotel. My room was very comfortable and relax. I wish they velvet parking wasn't so expensive. The apples where fresh and delicious.","12/29/2018"
"My boyfriend brought me here to surprise me and we wish we would've stayed home instead. From the moment you enter the door the security will rudely ask you what you are doing here like you are a criminal, and this happens every time you go in and out so you can't go in and out freely. Both day shift and night shift security is extremely rude. The best part of our stay was when we decided to take a night stroll and find our car keys on top of our car we requested to valet on the street in the middle of night. We stood by our car for 30 minutes and no one from valet came and when we tried to speak to someone inside we were met with hostility and unwillingness to claim responsibility because valet is a separate company however 1 hotel should be responsible for the valet and security they hire.","7/17/2020"
"Came here for my BooBoo's cousin wedding. The location, food and staff was really good. 5 stars all around. We didn't stay the night here.","8/10/2019"
"Rooms are beautiful with modern decor. But the customer service at front desk is subpar. Customer service at 1 hotel Central Park, it's sister property is way better. I stayed here as 1 hotel Central Park is not open.","9/13/2020"
"Had a surprise gathering for my birthday's boyfriend here. Location: Uber or take the train. Parking is difficult but there are parking garages in the area. Ambience: gorgeous views from the rooftop bar.  Music is set at a conversational volume which is nice. Food: N/A because I didn't have food Drinks: drinks were tasty. I had a migration and it was really good. Staff:  our waitress was really attentive and helpful. It wasn't the best service but I guess because the vibes and ambience are top quality, the service falls off.  I had to get up and go to the bar to get new clean glasses because we ordered bottle service. Price:  so we made a reservation and it's $100 per person but the rooftop closes at midnight which is a huge bummer! It's so unfortunate that they have such a wonderful view and they close at 12 in NYC?! Overall:  like I really do like this place but between the $100 per person minimum and the early closing hours, idk if it's worth it. They do have a lounge which closes at 2 so you can move from the rooftop to the lounge but who wants to do that?  I hope management would reconsider closing time on the rooftop because  it's too bad this establishment has this beautiful space but closes early for guests.","7/13/2019"
"This was one of the best hotels I have stayed at! Pros: - They are number one in staff selection. Young, energetic, helpful and good looking staff! (Chris and Kiara you guys rock!!!) - Apple cider at the entrance was very yummy and welcoming Rooms are very clean and views are amazing (especially the rooftop) - Heated pools -super fast breakfast delivery. Fresh food -an iPad that controls the light and temp of the room without having to get up. -super comfy beds Cons: -why are your showers made of clear glass? (Apparently the toilet was made of clear glass too? Yikes!) -valet needs to be standing outside by the doors/stairs. It is so confusing to figure out where to park your car specially when it's crowded with traffic.","10/26/2018"
"Seeing this kind of hotel exist and thrive in Brooklyn, NY totally blew my mind.  Modern as heck, environmentally conscious, and a pretty pricey splurge for the average tourist, this definitely beats any AirBnB-bs, where I was denied 8 places in the span of 3 days.  Maybe I need a new profile pic? Highlights: Complimentary rides in a Tesla:  This was honestly what sealed the deal to book here.  The driver just chills out front and will take guests anywhere within a 3 mile radius.  We took it to Sahadi's on Atlantic Ave and to a spot passed the Manhattan Bridge.  It was my first time in one of these cars and it was really cool!!  A very smoooooth ride in style. Rooftop Bar:  The best rooftop bar I've ever been to, it offered amazing views of the Brooklyn Bridge and Manhattan. $17 cocktails be damned, this was a great area to hang around and was open until 2am the night we stayed (midnight on weekdays). Location:  Tons of things nearby!  Juliana's/Grimaldi's for pizza, Brooklyn Bridge Park and  Water/Henry/Court/Smith Streets. The bed:  So damn comfortable that I contemplated taking the whole thing back home with me on the plane. Would have been 5 stars, but..... Check-in:  We arrived at 3:20pm (check-in time was 3pm), were told our room wasn't available yet and that they would call or text us when it was ready.  No one ever contacted us and we didn't get into our room until 7pm.  They did take care of four cocktails for the inconvenience. Bathroom:  I mean...I love my wife, but there was no privacy at all.  I'll leave it at that.  There is a big multi-gender restroom on the bottom floor though. Still really enjoyed it overall and would gladly stay here again.","9/6/2017"
"This a United Technologies Corporation preferred hotel, and boy do I know why! This was my third time staying in the course of a year and every time I do - I couldn't be more pleased.  Such a boutiquey hotel, the rooms are perfectaly adequate and luxiousus and you can't find views like this anywhere else!  The gym or better known as 'the field house' is small but I think every hotel gym is small.  The restaurant downstairs 'The Osprey' has food that will blow your mind.  And the 'Harriotts Bar' on the top floor, has relaxing seating and views that pictures don't do justice to!  Can't wait to come back.","12/7/2019"
"I had a great time here with my Holiday Company party, but was not impressed when I went this past weekend to the lounge. Are the views nice, yes. Is the vibe chic, yes. Is it still pretty empty, yes. Is it overpriced, YES. A vodka soda was $16 (w/o tip), which in my opinion is absurd because you end up paying $20 for 1 drink. You are not a beach club in Miami. Additionally the next day when I was looking at my receipt I noticed they charged an administration fee, literally never heard of a bar doing that ever. The good thing is that because the place doesn't get full, there also isn't a line at the bar, so drinks are served quickly.","4/9/2018"
"Was there at the rooftop bar (the place was moderately packed, but no free tables). However we got a spot 1 floor down. Views there are insane. Service could be a little better. Asked for straws for drinks and they said they do not have them, another waited brought straws later. They have to improve service, but overall the place is nice. Will definitely return.","7/17/2019"
"This hotel is extremely gorgeous! The design is so modern and rustic and outdoorsy, we loved it. Everything about the look of the hotel is exactly the type of hotel we like to stay in. The VIEW was BEAUTIFUL!! However, when we got here at 3:15 our hotel room was not ready. Check in is at 3pm. After a long flight we just wanted to get into our room freshen up and then head out and about. There were a couple of restaurants around the corner so we just went and had appetizers and wine while we waited. Once we got our room keys, they did not work the first time so we had to go back down to the lobby and replace them. We loved our hotel room!! The decor was amazing and it felt extremely cozy. I saw in another review about the bathroom doors or lack there of was weird unless you were with a significant other, we had a bathroom door and it did still feel like it lacked privacy. But we really didn't mind so not too big of a deal for us. The staff was very friendly, and greeted us Good Morning every day. The customer service was great! One thing I was disappointed in was that the restaurant closed its kitchen at 10pm. I thought that was early for a Friday night. If it were any other week night that would be understandable but for a weekend night it seemed early. We wanted to order at 9:45 but didn't because we thought that would have been rude so close to closing time. Overall this hotel was wonderful and we would definitely recommend it to everyone and will most likely come stay here again!!!","12/9/2017"
"I booked a room this week and spent two days by the pool. Firstly let me say Korey is Incredible! Best service I've ever had and such a funny and sweet guy. The pool area however could use better service. Irma our waitress was fantastic and Robin the young man who worked the area was so beyond helpful and accommodating especially to us as 3 minority women when to be honest service can go either way. There was an Asian woman with blond hair who did not give us the best service. She overlooked us standing right in front of her to speak to some Caucasian women behind us, when asked later on to be put on the list she wouldn't even bother and then told 3 very young black kids when it was time to clean the pool ""you got to get out"" very rudely. It was obvious she was only snarky and rude to the people of color as other guests by the pool agreed with us.","8/1/2020"
"Where do I start??? I live in NY and decided to do a staycation for my birthday. The 1 Hotel did not disappoint. The view is amazing and the staff is even more amazing and accommodating. Anything I needed from the front desk staff was provided to me. A special thanks to Danielle, the waitress at the pool. She made my stay exceptional! She was very attentive, personable and amazing at her job! I will most definitely be returning.","8/31/2019"
"Pretty views and cool rooms, but we're local NYers and booked this hotel for the sole purpose of having the pool for the holiday weekend. Not only did they let us know the pool was booked for the day while checking in, but they weren't able to guarantee a spot the following day. As I type my boyfriend is in line to put our name on a waitlist. He woke up at 6:45AM to stand in a line of 50+ people. Very disappointed in this system and the lack of transparency.","9/7/2020"
"Worth every penny for the spectacular unobstructed views of Brooklyn bridge and Statue of Liberty . Why you should stay there : The VIEWS !! The ultra friendly front desk and front door stuff (Good job management ) The Heated roof top infinity pool and lounge ! The overall ultra modern and friendly vibe iPad controlled room and all service amenities ! From your AC and lights to ordering your food all in one on iPad :) And finally the full glass sliding opening balcony door that gives you balcony in instant !! Why you should pass on it : The bathroom and shower lack privacy in standard rooms aside of suites . There is clear see thru window in shower that is just ridiculous idea when your bathroom isn't separated from bedroom . (This is not a problem if you are single occupant of your room ) however  the ridiculous bathroom and all not properly attached elements inside of it take one star away Special warm thank you and regards to front desk Christian and  Kiara for professionalism warm approach that made us feel very welcome . To the management : Change the glass in the shower to at least half foggy and for the love of gremlins mount toilet paper handles to the wall as well as mirrors !","10/26/2018"
"This rooftop bar is everything!!! The view ... whew!!! Doesn't get any better than this!!! Had the lobster roll for lunch, friend had the guacamole. They were ok. I definitely wasn't here for the food, as much as I was for the libations and view. Can't wait to return for sunset/nighttime view!!!","7/16/2018"
"I loved this hotel. From the filtered water spout feature in the room to the gorgeous views of the Brooklyn Bridge, I was really wowed by the hotel. It sits directly on the path of the Brooklyn promenade which has really turned into a rival of the high line in terms of visual interest and walkability. The front desk was friendly and nice when I straggled in at 8pm and granted me a late check out in case I needed it. It seemed like there were a lot of people enjoying the nightlife there but I just went up to my room, poured myself a whisky, and enjoyed the view. There's no better way of starting your vacation in nyc than staying at 1 Hotel Brooklyn Bridge.","5/26/2018"
"Not one thing was missing from this experience. The panoramic view from the NYC skyline to the  Brooklyn Bridge is beyond breathtaking! The Osprey restaurant is amazing...especially the manager Joleen, he makes it a quintessential dining experience every time. The rooms had every amenity you could imagine excluding a butler. Seriously, the hairdryer was amazing!! I had to buy one. We had a hammock in our room, how cool is that! The design and use of eco mixed materials was beautifully designed. Good job #1hotelbrooklynbridge","6/2/2018"
"I booked a King with a Brooklyn Bridge view for a Friday night 'staycation' with my boyfriend. I live in Brooklyn and have always wanted to stay in the hotel and eat at the restaurant downstairs. During our meal, I started to feel sick and ended up skipping my main course and opting out of dessert. Once back in our room, I became very ill and my boyfriend was feeling quite sick as well. We called the front desk to report what we agreed was food poisoning and they sent their head of security to our room. We heard him approach our door and say to himself ""You've gotta be f***ing kidding me."" My boyfriend asked him if he had said this and he denied it. He proceeded to be unhelpful and rude and I continued to be sick to my stomach all night in a $500 hotel room. The next morning I asked to speak with a manager about my experience and they said he/she had just stepped away and would contact me later. No one ever did and I have called on multiple occasions to explain the situation before writing this review. It's frustrating that an evening was spoiled by a bowl of bad mussels, but the whole experience was ruined by poor hospitality. So much for a 5-star experience...","2/7/2019"
"Awesome rooftop with great views over manhattan and Brooklyn bridge. Probably the best scenic in Brooklyn. However this comes with a price.. the staff is a disaster! Sure they just opened but come on! No one knows anything, about anything! And by some reason you need a stamp but no one really knows why.. they say that you can bring drinks down to the lobby bar, when you enter the elevator with your drinks, the same person tells you no. They will really need to work on their staff and get their guidelines together","6/2/2017"
"My friend and I noticed this rooftop bar whilst we were walking after our Lombardi's dinner. I'm giving this four stars for the following: -the view -the lack of cover charge If it weren't for those two above, it's a 2-star due to: -the crowd (people were kind of unfriendly and off putting here) -the drink selection sucked -the prices were kind of high but it makes sense if there's no cover -the bartenders were not helpful This place was pretty new when I went in June though, so maybe they've turned it around.","11/6/2017"
"Best rooftop drink? Nahh. Best view? Hands down, no question ask. I don't think people come here for tasty drinks, mostly for the view and the experience. Pretty pricy for the drinks. In a high-class hotel like this , you expect the drink to be good, but yeah unfortunately its not. So just keep your complaints to yourself and enjoy the view. Dress code? Not require but i would recommend. Why? Cause the bartender seem to serve those who dress very very nice first. Over all a decent experience, all 5 stars goes to the view alone.","5/13/2018"
"I see many reviews are for the rooftop, so let me preface the review by saying: I stayed in a room during my short staycation. Hotel: Amazing! Very eco-friendly and beautiful design. The hotel provides beautiful work spaces, amazing rooms, great staff (in person vs over the phone, more about that later), and, yes, a nice rooftop with views. Concept: In a word, ""green"". Wood, stone, and small mini-plant/moss garden in the room. I have not figured out the purpose of the ""Now/Not now"" stone, though. Room: Dumbo King. Airy and somewhat calming. My room did not have a tub, but there is a separate toilet and shower. They are separated by a frosted glass wall. The floors are cement in all of the bathroom areas. The shower gel, soap, and lotions are nice as well. Not too perfumey. There is an esteamer, yoga mat, free slipper socks (to take!), and a cozy daybead and comfy flexible lounger. The bed is very comfortable, and at least 72 in. x 76 in. The lighting and A/C are controlled by the iPad docked near the bed. There are multiple lighting combinations to play around with. There is also the option to set a ""red"" privacy light and a ""green"" service light outside the door for housekeeping. There was a partial view of the east river and Brooklyn Bridge from the room, the rest was the other side of Furman street. No bluetooth speaker(s)!!!, though. Rooftop bar: Nice views, but the atmosphere and crowd were not really my scene. Techno, alcohol, unnecessarily loud conversations... I will just say no one would mistake it for a charity fundraiser. Those not staying in the hotel have to wait downstairs in a queue that is roped off. Visualize that, does it sound familiar? Then you have an idea of the rooftop atmosphere. To be fair, I only went at night, and not the next morning/afternoon. Location: Brooklyn Heights waterfront. So, yes. Service: I had a great experience face-to-face with all staff members. Very friendly and helpful. The text service was also adequate during my stay. Service over the phone leaves a lot to be desired. I had a feeling the person ""assisting"" me wanted to do everything else but that. What not 5 stars? Two reasons: 1. No bluetooth speaker(s)!!! and 2. I was overcharged for an in-room snack (took one item, was charged for two). That is not really a big deal, but it does point to a lack of detail by the turndown staff since either I was just erroneously charged during inventory, or it was taken by a prior guest, and not replaced or reported. Overall: Worth the stay. Beautiful and natural, great views, and a wonderful staff.","9/6/2017"
"I am a big fan of the 1 hotel properties.  Stay at the Miami location several times.  Actually we were of of the first few guests when they opened.  Celebrated birthdays and anniversaries there. Spend sometime at the one in Brooklyn during April to celebrate my daughter's birthday.  Today we tried celebrating my next daughter's birthday and it was a mess.  First room 504 air was not working. They did not tell us anything and we had the balloons and everything out.  The cake was melting that's how warm the room was so they told us they will move us to 904. The air worked in the bedroom only.  Finally they said the whole line for that side was not working.  No a word from a manager or anyone else.  I want to give a huge and grateful acknowledgment to Davis who helped us with our bags and everything.  He has the best attitude.  So positive and kind.  I was ready to move my daughter to another hotel and David made me change my mind with his positive words.  Thank you David.  You are awesome.","6/1/2021"
"My boyfriend & I spent our staycation/birthday celebration here. The rooftop view is captivating and the service we received was wonderful. Upon arrival the concierge asked what brought us to Brooklyn (we live in the tristate) and once I exclaimed my birthday was the next day a large smile grew on her face. As we were getting ready to head out to dinner our bell rang and it was a bottle of champagne compliments of the desk. We are both freshly 23 (in other words, we aren't high rollers) so balling out on their common king suite with no special view was a stretch for us, and the fact that they still went above and beyond was THE best feeling. The rooms are stellar & even after check out they were able to hold our bags while we spent a few hours on the roof. The french fries ... ORDER THEM any chance you get!! They're amazing!","9/3/2017"
"I am staying here right now and am  so thrilled with the entire venue. From the smiley reception ,the great cafe,the exquisite suite with unsurpassable views including a hammock in the suite overlooking the Brooklyn Bridge skyline water and Statue of Liberty.  This is a  jewel in the making!!    Brand new but  so much potential to be a true front runner in the burgeoning Brooklyn hotel scene.  When the spa. and fine dining restaurant open this will be as close to perfection as one can hope for!! I am the pickiest of critics and can say this is one of my most wonderful fun experiences.  The entire surrounding area adds to the enhancement I simply CANNOT wait to return. A perfect stacation or for a vacation they really get it","2/26/2017"
"I have stayed at other 1Hotels and this by far is the worst! You would think the brand would hold integrity throughout the franchise but I was proven wrong time and time again. Let's start with the pool reservations, the email that was sent three days before I checked in stated that if I wanted to reserve a time for the pool to do so via the link provided or via the App. Also the reservations weren't open to hotel guests until the night before at 7pm. When the link and App did not work, I called the front desk where I was told that reservations were completely booked for my entire stay and reservations for the pool were made 14 days prior to the dates selected. I was then told to email the concierge who then told me the same thing. To top it off the concierge's email was very dismissive. Secondly the initial room that I was assigned faced public urinals when I paid for a premium room facing the Brooklyn Bridge. When they moved me they gave me a room with a better view however smaller than what I paid for. They eventually moved me to a better room the next night however when I left for the day in the early afternoon I left the service light on and it was not serviced on my return 3 hours later. I tried calling housekeeping but the line was busy. I reached out to the front desk and they replied that housekeeping left for the day but they will try to find someone to service the room. I went down to the front desk and they told me they would send someone right away. Two hours later they still didn't send anyone. I had to request again for service and then they finally came 7 hours later after the  initial request!! The straw that broke the camel's back was the next morning, the hot water decided that it didn't want to come on. At this point, I was done. I can not believe how poorly this hotel is run and the lack of communication between departments. You guys failed tremendously and I left disappointed with the 1Hotel brand.","9/7/2021"
"We cannot say enough great things about 1 Hotel Brooklyn Bridge! Me and my now fiancé visited 1 hotel at the beginning of March. Little did I know our staycation was actually my engagement night! The staff at 1 Hotel was so amazing to my fiancé and upgraded us to a suite to make our stay so special! The setting paired with the room was a dream! The staff was so happy to congratulate and accommodate us. I couldn't ask for a better way to say yes to the man of my dreams!!","10/29/2020"
"Luxurious Hotel with an amazing rooftop frautring breathtaking views of all of Manhattan. Expensive but worth it. They have great parties with awesome artists and a pool on the roof too.","6/8/2019"
"I recently stayed here on a staycation during Memorial Day weekend and it was a very nice experience. The room was cozy and comfy but, I do wish they would supply room slippers for your stay for the price that a room costs. The view from our room was ok. We could see part of the Brooklyn Bridge and the rest of the view was the building across the street. The service at the hotel is great. I think that made up for not having room slippers available. LOL!! This hotel has an amazing view of the city skyline from the pool area and the pool is pretty big (for NYC standards) to. If you're looking for a hotel then stay here as it's conveniently located in Dumbo and has easy access to Manhattan. You'll love it.","5/29/2019"
"Words can't express how nice this hotel is. The staff are very welcoming, professional and nice, they get 10 plus stars. The rooms are very nice and clean. You would really have to experience it yourself because I'm speechless. The view of the Brooklyn Bridge from the roof top is simply gorgeous.. I think this is one of the best hotels that I have stayed in all around 5 stars and more.","11/24/2018"
"The 1 Hotel Brooklyn Bridge is an incredible experience. I live in New York City and recently took a staycation here in the summer and loved every minute of it. The 1 is like no other hotel and after you leave, you will feel refreshed and relaxed. The Pool: extremely private, excessive service to ensure you're hydrated and fed. Incredible city views and no shortage of furniture to lay out in the sun or in the shade. The Restaurants: The Osprey for dinner was a magical experience, it did not feel like I was in the city. It's surrounded by nature and steps from the Brooklyn Bridge. The cafe is also great for a quick morning coffee or snack. The Room: waking up to a view of the Brooklyn Bridge was surreal. The shower and shower products are an experience themselves! The room was extremely clean and the bed was very comfortable. The Staff: incredibly friendly and accommodating This was my second stay at the 1 and I would absolutely do it over and over again.","7/29/2019"
"Firstly, I really like the location and the view is amazing. Drinks are always tasty and whether you are in the lounge, or the rooftop bar, the atmosphere suits the setting. We sat in the lounge because we were told it was a $50 minimum spend to sit on some couches on the rooftop. This is a bit silly but the message was passed onto us in a non offensive manner. The server in the lounge was friendly enough and the drinks came out quite quickly due to it being fairly empty. I feel that they provided the right level of service without getting too much in the way. Its not stand out amazing service, but its pretty much what you need it to be.","7/28/2019"
"I absolutely love this place!!!! I found this hotel trying to find a place to stay in New York.  I decided on this Brooklyn hotel because it was close to the airport and close enough to manhattan and for the price, a great choice to stay in a good hotel. When I arrived, my expectations were far exceeded. This place is beyond cool, cozy, clean, fun and upbeat. Truly beautiful design, great value, amazing room with an incredible room and better than all this, THE service is exceptional!! from the front desk, bell hop, door man to the restaurant the staff here is on point!!! I will definitely be back and I will definitely try their hotel in Miami and manhattan purely based on how great this stay was. I'm in the room and thoroughly enjoying my room.","11/13/2018"
"I spent the night here with my sorority sisters in celebration of our anniversary.  The staff was amazing and extremely helpful and accommodating.  Sabine and David were not only professional and friendly, they provided great customer service and made our stay perfect!  We could not have asked for more.","4/12/2021"
"My husband and I had the most amazing experience at 1HBB.  Strongly recommend for couples who need some weekend getaway. Hotel staff were friendly and efficient, great service at the rooftop pool (even at 90+ degrees). Get the truffle fries! Couples massage at the Bamford Haybarn Spa was perfection! Friendly service at the Osprey, dinner was delicious with great choices.  We sat outside at night with the summer breeze, it was so romantic.  We will come back for the cocktail ""All Hans on Deck"" for sure! The view of our room facing the Brooklyn Bridge is incredible.  We stared out our wide opened window all day and night, listened to the sounds and fell in love with NY all over again.","7/21/2019"
"This rooftop bar view will not disappoint! I am a cocktail snob, but the bartenders could dip me in pool water and then pour it to me, for all I am concerned, and I would still come back to lounge and soak in the view of Manhattan AND the Brooklyn Bridge. 10/10 must bring out of town guests here if not for a photo opp with that backdrop. The chill vibes and drink selection was very reminiscent of Roosevelt hotel in the City, however in reading other reviews it seems that the staff might not be as hospitable, unfortunately, if looking for somewhere to stay.  I find this hard to believe, because all staff at The Osprey, the downstairs restaurant, were above and beyond nice, considering their busy pace.  The 1 Hotel rates are comparable, so I will have to try to stay here in the future so as to debunk or confirm this suspicion personally. As of now I remain unbiased and look forward to this opportunity.","5/31/2018"
"My boyfriend and I took a weekend trip here and were so excited based on the views and the appeal of the location. Upon arrival we spoke with the concierge who kindly took our temperatures and offered hand sanitizer to us. However, this gentleman was not informed about the valet parking offer this hotel provides which at first alarmed us due to the high cost of parking in the area but we were able to receive our free valet parking after speaking with another informed member of the team, Remy. Check in was perfect, Remt offered us suggestions for our day, and was able to get us set up with our room package which came with specialty chocolates, French macarons, and a bottle of Prosecco! Upon entering our room our view was of an empty apartment building across the way... of course if you turned your head and bent your body a bit you could get a glance of the bridge but we had spent so much money on the room, that we really were paying for the view and had not received that. With a hotel that is occupying very minimal guests due to covid restrictions, we would've thought that the guests would've gotten prime room views. My boyfriend went down just to make a kind request at changing our room, and Remy was one again so thoughtful and immediately provided us with a new room of the most exceptional and unobstructed view! The windows were so amazing, that we didn't hear a thing outside which was great. We loved being in such close proximity to the whole downtown area too! The room was immaculate with the exception of some heavy rust stains by the bathroom faucet, but otherwise I could not have drawn up a more gorgeous room! The attention to detail was superb and we felt so safe and comfortable during our stay! We were so pleased with how comfortable and modern and eco-friendly the entire hotel was! The digital room thermostat was amazing and we noticed any time we got warm or cold, that the second we utilized that tool, the room instantly became more comfortable. The shower was unreal as well, the water pressure was amazing and to be able to shower with a view of that city and bridge was top notch (even the lotion, body soap, and shampoo/conditioner were excellent)! The rooftop bar is no longer available for use due to restrictions but it is available for use as an observation deck which was so great! The beds were pretty firm, but that's to be expected at most hotels. Overall, our stay was excellent and I cannot wait to return to 1 Hotel, and even check out more of their offered locations!","2/22/2021"
"The rooftop bar is worth the visit.  I met up with some friends for a few drinks; we ordered some food as well, basically hot dogs and burgers, which were fine, but nothing to write home (or yelp) about.  The views and atmosphere, though, were great.  I highly recommend checking it out.","6/2/2018"
"Discovered that the lobby of this hotel is a great place to hang out, order a drink, and enjoy the nice ambiance. After taking a ferry ride to the area, we were at a loss for what to do with our time til the Brooklyn Heights Social Club opened up at 5pm, but it turned out that the lobby was the perfect option! The staff was extremely warm and friendly the whole time, even though we were just squatters and not full-on hotel guests, which I appreciated! We were able to order drinks and cocktails and enjoy them there even though the upstairs bar wasn't open yet. Turns out we weren't able to end up going to the Social Club for drinks because we had a baby with us and they had a rule against baby strollers (or babies in general), but I couldn't hold it against them too much because I could understand that some people might not want kids and babies running around while they enjoyed their high end cocktails and the view of the BK Bridge. Based on the service I'd recommend the hotel to friends looking for a place to stay in the area, and I'll definitely be back to hang and get a drink.","3/21/2018"
"We paid over $2k for the room to have our wedding weekend photoshoot and reveal and on the day of the shoot we are told that we need some special photo document filled out to take photos and do the reveal in the hotel. Well, no body mentioned this when i was booking and we specifically told them we want a wedding photo shoot within the hotel property. Would not recommend at all! And, they've lost a loyal customer because I've staid there before but never again. The food in the Osprey was mediocre and the lady at the front who told us we cant take photos was rude and uncaring she did not provide alternatives. If you want a good experience go elsewhere! I have to add, the suite we booked had awesome views but the room layout was really weird...the bedroom and living room where not separated bu a door but by a wall and the shower is in public view so you don't get much privacy. If not for the inattentive concierge and us not being able to take photos i would have given 4 stars .... but on my big day they could have come up with something other than a ""no"". Never again and would never recommend to anyone!","6/8/2021"
"Overall, the hotel has nice facilities - rooms, bathrooms, and was overall very clean. The location is also great, as it is close to many restaurants, and has a great view of the bridge. Was not as impressed with the hotel's service capabilities. Requests for coffee refills (for the nespresso machine), extra towels, etc. went missed, and requests were granted often the next day but never immediately. Also stayed for NYE, and was told that there would be complimentary hot chocolate on the roof... however went to the roof and it was not available -I think that sums up the stay.","1/1/2021"
"****Reviewing the BARS only, have not stayed at the actual hotel**** This is one of a handful of my go to spots, especially in the summer.  There are really 3 bars in one here.  First is on the ground level with an inside/outside patio bar with beer, wine and a light menu readily available.  Im not a huge live music guy but they do a great job with keeping the music adding to the experience rather than taking away from it. Next they have a great atrium style full bar inside with super high ceilings, couches, etc. Lasty there is a rooftop bar with very little bro activity. The view form the bar is quite possibly the best view of lower manhattan I've personally come across. You can see several bridges, and all the iconic buildings. Being up there for sunset is fantastic.","6/1/2018"
"Some of the staff where nice others where not and make you feel almost as if your kind doesn't belong there at the entrance a security before I even got through the door asked me what's name on the reservations as if he was even the clerk who was going to assist me & check me in how ever the clerk at the front desk was very warning and nice gave me no problems and treated me very kind and laughed with me .... the room was nice I like the eco friendly vibes in the rooms the view was nice ... now my problem was at the rooftop pool when we went to great the person who does the reservations he looked at me like what are you doing here told me it wouldn't happened with me going to the pool because so many people where on the waiting list them I offered him money & all of a sudden he found me chairs to sit on , how ever the next day he stared me down and told me I told u to be here at 6:30 am & I gave u chairs yesterday ! In a very rude tone as if HE DID ME A FAVOR ... LIKE IM NOT THERE WASTING MY MONEY OR LIKE MAYBE SINCE IM A HISPANIC WOMAN OF COLOR MY MONEY HAS NO VALUE .... I SEEN HIM ACT VERY DIFFERENT TOWARDS PEOPLE WHO WHERE WHITE AND HOW NICE AND WELCOMING GE WAS TO THEM.... MY QUESTION IS ARE YOU THE ONE WORKING HERE OR ME ? THAT YOURE TREATING ME AS A PEASANT ? I DONT CARE HOW NICE THE VIEWS WHERE IVE NEVER BEEN TO A HOTEL WHERE STAFF MEMBER MAKE U FEE TOTALY AWKWARD LIKE YOUR KIND DOESNT BELONG THERE ITS TRULY SICKENING..... I won't ever go back there.","7/28/2020"
"Beautiful view, beautiful cocktails, super polite and friendly service! They stay out of your way for most of the time unless you need them, and the pricing isn't blown out of proportion for a Brooklyn rooftop bar with beautiful city views. It's a wonderful place to take friends and family, and is especially nice on a summer day/evening and a great place to have in pocket when thinking of rooftop bars to go to in the area. Their lobby is also SO aesthetic, we were in love!! Great job, 1 Brooklyn hotel!","12/15/2018"
"On the road for work 220+ days a year for the last 10+ years and I'm thinking this is the best hotel I've ever stayed in. Rooms, view, bed were all amazing bu those things are easy to get right. The cumulative effect of all the little things was what made this hotel great. The wooden RFID room keys instead of the standard plastic ones. Filtered water tap in the rooms built into a nook in the wall. Glassware in room was beautiful. Concrete floors in bathroom with no ledge into shower or toilet. Refillable soap and shampoo containers. The in room couch and table were perfect. Floor to ceiling window across the whole wall. Free EV parking and charging. Tesla X courtesy car. Customer service was better than anywhere I have seen before. We stayed one night and they knew my name and face. Food was great. Upstairs bar was beautifully done with views of the whole city but didn't feel too vibed out like the Standard rooftop bar. Kiki at reception and Wes at the porter desk both looked genuinely happy to be there and talk to the guest. The lack of being right in Manhattan was made up for ten fold by the great customer service.","11/5/2019"
"Romantic, modern, city vibes atmosphere. Good music, great guac dip. Pool is small but ok. Awesome view to the Brooklyn bridge and parts of the city line. I don't recommend their coffee, ugh, it was awful. Decoration was beautiful and relaxing. Make sure to get there earlier than check in time if you have other plans, check in gets very busy and might have to wait at the lobby for awhile for about 1-2 hours.","10/30/2019"
"Gorgeous views of manhattan skyline, and the Brooklyn Bridge.  Rooms are green and  so interesting.  Filtered  water in each room Which is great. Would absolutely stay here again.  The garden on the 10th floor is outside with heat lamps. The views can not be beat.","1/27/2019"
"This hotel is absolutely lovely!!! Everything about it the views, rooms, decor, restaurant, rooftop bar, and staff.  Would be happy to come back and stay here anytime.  It is worth the price and the location is perfect!!! Definitely one of my favorite hotels and it's located in one of my favorite places!","8/4/2018"
"Upon arrival I was told by the stellar front desk team (whom also recommended a FANTASTIC restaurant for a late bite since we checked in around 10pm) that my room had been upgraded. I had mentioned in my booking that I was visiting to celebrate my birthday, but wasn't expecting to be upgraded to a room with one of the best views in the hotel! The surprises didn't stop there - in the room I discovered a handwritten birthday note along with a travel-sized bottle of botanical pillow mist! The room is super eco-friendly, cozy, and clean; offers filtered tap water, cozy knit socks, a yoga mat, and the bed is so comfy! An iPad will help you discover the area and is also your way of contacting the front desk. The views cannot be beat either. With a floor-to-ceiling sliding window we had a perfect view of the Brooklyn Bridge and NYC skyline. The rooftop pool offers sweeping views from water to skyline to the Statue of Liberty, but get there early as chairs will fill up quick. The hotel also comped our second round of drinks due to a computer glitch that delayed our food delivery. This hotel goes above & beyond and is a must-stay in Brooklyn.","9/27/2020"
"The room was nice, but the customer service was lackluster. To be clear everyone was ""nice"" but kept telling me they couldn't do anything to help me.  People kept giving me the ""sorry, I can't help you"" line.  For example, I had a $30 credit for food from the organization that booked the hotel for me, but apparently, that couldn't be used for room service, only the restaurant, that didn't open until 11 am, so I ended up paying out of pocket.  When I asked, ""why?"" I just got ""sorry, I can't help you.""  When I asked about the car service and the car wasn't available, I just got shrugged shoulders.  When I called later, to let them know I left my scarf in my hotel room, they told me they couldn't do anything for me. Instead, I had to submit a ticket to ilostmystuff.com and pay to have my item returned to me.  Nothing out of this world, but little reasons that I won't be coming back.","4/18/2018"
"Gorgeous hotel, eco friendly, fantastic location. The entire interior smells like a sandalwood Forrest, like a mix of Le Labo Santal 33 and fahrenheit cologne. It's utterly dreamy. I love the tech aspect of it, everything you need is on a personalized iPad next to your bed - thermostat controls, lighting and ambiance options, room service, car rental, turn down service, weather(!)... everything you need. I've never had an issue with the staff in the times I've stayed here, they are all courteous and friendly. The complimentary comfy socks are outstanding, the robes could use an upgrade. Yoga mats provided in the rooms also and a filtered water dispenser. The location is right on the water, you an have a picnic and watch the sunset over Manhattan and Lady Liberty every night. It's really something special. Treat yo'self and give this place a shot.","7/30/2018"
"This is one of the most Beautiful and hippest places in New York. The vibe is unmatched. Every little detail at this hotel was carefully picked out and put in place. The rooftop has a breathtaking view and an awesome bar that offers handcrafted cocktails. This place is a must see!","9/30/2018"
"I live in the neighborhood, and needed to move apartments. When I went to drop off a suitcase, Bethany at the front desk arranged for early check in at 9am. I hadn't even asked and she just kindly offered. Then she upgraded me to a room with a beautiful view of the Statue of Liberty. And then Anthony, the bellman, was so generous and kind bringing my bags, helped orient me to the room, and was extremely professional and courteous. A lovely experience amidst the stressful experience of moving apartments. And then of course the hotel itself is just great!","1/30/2020"
"The management of this place decept me a lot. I really love the design, the view and all the decoration.  I came here few times already but I will not.","3/29/2018"
"How can this place be a 5 star hotel? The location, rooftop bar, and rustic style are major pluses but our 2 night stay experience was a little subpar. We booked two rooms and when we checked in at 1430 we were told the rooms weren't ready yet. They offered to hold our bags so we dropped them off. Usually check in is at 1500 and they said they would call us when the rooms were ready so we lounged around until we got the call at 1530. Minor delay since we had a dinner at 1700 but it should be fine I thought. After going up to our room, we expected our bags to be delivered already but they were not so we first waited 15 mins then called. They said they would deliver them right away. Waited another 15 mins called again, they said sorry and then said they would deliver them right away. Another 15 mins, I just went downstairs myself to pick the bags up. What a waste of 45 mins. While we were getting ready for dinner (changing), another guest enters our room with her key. Both of us are surprised by what just happened. She calmly said she would go back downstairs and I called immediately to see what was going on. The receptionist apologized and said they would fix the problem. A couple mins later the manager called saying sorry about what happened and offered us a round of drinks. We were in a hurry and don't really drink so I declined. At the end of the call I was informed that I needed to swipe my card for incidentals. Epic fail check in I say. During our stay, we heard some noice coming from the room upstairs as if they were dragging furniture and load screaming in the hall ways. I can conclude that the rooms are below average sound insulation. Lastly the shower water pressure and temperature change from weak to strong from hot to cold so their plumbing may not be the best depending on if other guests flush or are also taking showers. In conclusion, we paid about ~$400 a night for the non-scenic view rooms. The location is awesome as it's a bridge away from Manhattan and is very close to shake shack and Juliana's pizza. There are great water views of Manhattan and the Brooklyn bridge but  the hotel service, insulation, and plumbing are suspect. Maybe they will improve since they are relatively new but for now I'll have to rate them as needs improvement.","10/9/2017"
"I will start off by saying that the limited staff that was available was incredibly courteous. Robert and Mary at the front desk had a wonderful smile on their faces, after what you could tell was a very busy weekend. Unfortunately the remainder of our stay wasn't as pleasant. Upon arrival there was no valet so we had to lug our bags from the parking garage. Check-in was simple but it wasn't made clear that we had to use our cell phones for any requests, we tried to use the hotel phone which had no answer causing us to go downstairs and talk to the front desk directly. At which point we were told we would receive a text message and needed to reply to that number for all requests. There are a few problems with this: the fact that we needed to be aware of our cell phones the entire stay was a stress point for us and completely defeated the purpose of our stay as our plan was to have a technology detox and shut off our phones entirely. Not only did we need to be aware of our phones for any requests but we then had to coordinate all food deliveries instead of having the staff deliver it to our door. Once again we stayed at a hotel so we could rest and decompress and this did not allow us to do so. Of course we understood that this is an uncertain time so we were willing to turn a blind eye to most of these inconveniences as we were receiving a great deal in the price. But there are a few things that were totally unacceptable: 1. Our room was located right next to the stairs. Normally this wouldn't be a problem but due to COVID-19 I think there was a lot more foot traffic due to the limit of people in elevators. All we could hear most of the day was the door opening and closing heavily. 2. We had our privacy turned on however a staff member decided to knock on our door. We thought it was an emergency so we ran to get ourselves presentable for someone to enter the room. Once we were just about ready the staff member spoke and let us know he ""wanted to fill the mini-bar""... we did not request this and the disruption did not come at a good time. 3. We were told we could have a late check out (4PM) and then we once again got a interruptive knock on our door @ 1PM asking us to leave immediately because they were no longer offering that courtesy. 4. The reading light on the side closest to the window did not work at all which is pretty essential for us before bed. 5. We only received one shower towel and no robes or slippers in our room. Overall the cons, outweighed the pros and this was not what I expected from the 1Hotel Standard. I confronted the manager Hans directly about our issues and his response was to credit our $35 dollar destination fee. I'll let you decide if you feel this is a proper compensation.","8/21/2020"
"So glad I didn't let bad reviews sway me away from this gem. Meagan (Concierge) was thoughtful and caring when a situation came up. Tori ( front staff) was great from email to in person. Jonathan (Concierge) goes above and beyond! Housekeeping manager was defensive when it came to cleanliness issues I found in the room but they did move my room and gave me a late check out so I was happy with that. I just wish she would have listened rather than defended. BUY a hotel candle in the cafe! CHECK out the Eco friendly practices in every area as it makes you self check your own daily practices. Timing in showers, no plastic and lighting. OOOPS I broke the timing glass mechanism in the shower to time my shower to 5 minutes. I mean when you add soap and glass in a shower it is not a good mix! I didn't care for the wood scents in the bathrooms either but I got the approach to the hotel and accepted it. Pool itself is a nice vibe and view. There rooms are very thought out with every single area. PACK a water bottle to fill up in your room in the entry water fill up. Such a great idea. MAKEUP lighting yessss. I appreciated that. Main issue was I went to the outside eating area when they first opened.  There were only 3 of us drinking and eating and they gave me the wrong credit card after charging the wrong credit card for my food. Too early for an oooops moment in the day. We also reserved seating at the reserve area and was told it was $150 minimum however they changed it to $300 when I arrived. That had to be the most aggravating thing. Above all this hotel is not perfect but neither is your house. So I would still give it at least 4 stars and reccomend  it to everyone.","7/9/2018"
"Beautiful roof view no matter day or night. Fresh fruit provided at lobby everyday. SUPER friendly and helpful staff. like Eco-friendly concept hotel It's pricey -- however, compare to what you can in Manhattan. it worth the $$$$. Great location under the Brooklyn bridge. Walk distance to various eats and funs.","9/14/2018"
"Terrible service. Stay there one night, got charged 2 days valet parking. I talked with the front desk and got confirmed they will refund me, however they did not process any refund. The worst luxury hotel ever. Room is extremely tiny, all you get is the view.","10/3/2020"
"Drinks are expensive..but that view though! Hard to find parking around there so I suggest taking a cab.","10/4/2019"
"Brooklyn waterfront is my favourite part of NY and this hotel rooftop offers the perfect view. Plenty of room to hangout at grab a drink. We simply walked in on a summer day after a 10 minute wait to get on the elevator.  I did see tables which can be reserved for lunch/brunch. If youre staying at the hotel they also have a pool, but this is not accessible if youre not a guest. Perfect summer rooftop for a drink","1/28/2018"
"I have been to the rooftop at the One hotel in Brooklyn a number of times. When our friends came from Seattle a week a go, we decide to take them to see the beautiful views from the rooftop and have a few drinks. But when we came there was a $20 DOLLAR CHARGE PER PERSON.  Are you kidding. There are so many rooftops bars that don't have a charge. Total ripoff we didn't go, and there was also a large group in front of us that decided not to go. I told them go the the Gansevoort hotel or top of 30 rock, both are free. You should be embarrassed.","6/11/2019"
"Looking for a place to enjoy beautiful weather in the evening? Walk and and talk the elevator straight to the roof, which is open to anyone (not simply hotel guests). Plenty of seating, heat lamps sprinkled around, and plants to keep the vibes fresh. The view of the Brooklyn Bridge and Manhattan skyline is INSANE from here- just breathtaking, whether you're a Brooklynite or just visiting. Need a snack? Get the giant plate of French fries (and maybe a glass of red wine).","10/23/2017"
"June of 2017 my daughter and I did NYC. We walked across the Brooklyn Bridge and found this gem. Spent the day enjoying Mojitos and Rosè!  Incredible views, pleasant staff, and cocktails reasonably priced.  Get there early to get a seat with a view.  If you want to see the sunset and enjoy magnificent views. This is the place!.","5/30/2018"
"'Love the view, staff, and the food. The rooms, not so much. Upgraded room with a view is incredibly dark. Small. One sink. And a counter the size of a large pizza box. We've stayed multiple times; don't think I can do it again.","11/27/2019"
"We were out Sunday riding when my bf and I decided to stop for a drink. We asked if we could sit at the bar and our bikes were left in the lobby since there weren't bike racks in front. We ordered two drinks and took a seat on a sofa. Beautiful place - gorgeous furniture, lighting, and decor. I finished my drink, Ray went to use the bathroom, and I started making my way out to get the bikes.. I suppose we stood out, I was in a hoodie and my bf a large messenger back on. We look young too. Very set apart from the other adults dressed nicely. Perhaps the only latinos at this time.  I can't think of any other reason why we would be mistreated.. A short statured white man rushed over to me and says ""you can't come here with bikes and this is not a public restroom"". I said ""okay, but we sat here for half hour and had drinks, so what's the problem?"" There were now scooters in the lobby as well. Ray appears and tells him, "" you just told me the same thing and I told you we were having drinks, now you're talking to her like we didn't speak?"" The guy says, ""the bartender said you didn't"" and Ray responds, ""you're lying, we can go back there and ask him now""..  The guy declined and they exchanged a few more words. I wanted to disappear! Highly embarrassing. We left so upset. It ruined our experience and almost ruined my whole day!","4/2/2017"
"Horrible service. This is such a beautiful property, but the people working there are so rude- and totally don't get what the service industry is about.  I went to the lobby bar once and had poor service, tried the roof deck on my second visit and experienced even worse service. Sorry friends- to those of you that are calling this place a ""true five star"" and ""best place ever"" - you need to get out more.  This place needs to grow up.","8/11/2017"
"Terrible stay. For the money you spend it's not flexible and the customer service is horrible . If you're wanting to just stay in your room it's great but it is a pain to use the amenities and the rooms are 400 a night. You can get more out of a holiday inn.i do not recommend","8/9/2020"
"Super trendy-cool hotel. The lobby is the epitome of chill vibes. My roommate and I studied for 4 hours, perfectly content with the atmosphere. The music level is good; not overpowering, not cringingly soft, but just the right amount for Shazam to catch the song playing. Dogs are welcome, which just makes the atmosphere SO much better. Sound does not travel due to the large open space and floor-to-ceiling windows. The bathrooms are to the right of The Osprey and down the stairs to the left. They're communal with designated women and men stalls within the restroom, but they all share sinks so don't be alarmed when there's a man washing his hands outside the stalls. Overall I'm very impressed by this place and it's definitely one of the spots I take people when they come to visit the city.","3/18/2018"
"Me and my husband have spent one of our best days in New York City here in 1 hotel. We stayed in hotel 1 Brooklyn bridge to celebrate our 9th anniversary. We felt in love with the concept of this hotel. All staff was very friendly, the let us to take pictures with professional camera and guest photographer. Even rooftop staff let us photoshoot for 15 minutes or so (we didn't know that we had to get a special permission for shooting, since it was our first experience in NYC). The room design is very cool and the view to Brooklyn bridge and Manhattan is amazing! In - Room food was pretty good and the menu is not overpriced. We also enjoyed our breakfast at the cafe on the first floor. Location is great to hangout in Dumbo area or downtown Brooklyn. Some day we will be back! No doubts!","3/26/2018"
"Gorgeous location is small compensation for the thin walls, strangely un-private bathrooms and faux-hipster WeWork style vibe.  Oh and the rooftop bar has a $50 per person minimum even for guests.  And was it me or are the beds a couple inches shorter than normal?","7/17/2020"
"Where are the baby changing area in the lobby/basement bathrooms?! Came here with a friend and his baby and there was no baby changing area to our knowledge.","8/10/2019"
"I want to give it 5 stars, but I'm picky.  The reason I knocked it down a star was for 2 things.  First, I could hear the neighbors very clearly from the adjoining door.  I can get that at a cheap hotel, but was surprised to hear clear conversations (and more, if you get the drift) during my stay.  Secondly, I personally didn't like the clear shower doors.  They have opaque for the toilet, but not the shower.  I was here with family, so it was a bit awkward. But overall, the view is unparalleled, and I wouldn't want to stay anywhere else.  Rooftop bar was always crowded, fyi.  The staff was amazing and very attentive as well as polite.  I'd give the overall experience a 5-star, and will guarantee that this hotel is going to be booked solidly.","8/13/2017"
"Beautiful hotel and an even more incredible staff. They gave us a room upgrade free of charge! Was planning to spend the night here but unfortunately something urgent came up and my partner and I had to leave at night. We were extremely upset but as I was checking out, the staff was so understanding and did not charge us for the night I booked! We were so surprised as we were not expecting this at all. Will definitely come back here to spend a weekend here. The view from the room was just absolutely breathtaking. *Room 815 was beautiful!!!!*","7/2/2018"
"Quite possibly the best rooftop bar I've been to. Excellent, accommodating staff. Music is chill but upbeat to accompany the day drinking. Great local Brooklyn beer selection - try KelSo. That view tho... full view of the Brooklyn bridge, Manhattan, and Dumbo park. Perfect day drinking spot.","8/5/2017"
"Nice hotel with spacious rooms in DUMBO. Environmentally friendly hotel and service was good, but be prepared to walk a little to restaurants, the hotel is a tad isolated. Nice views of the Statue and the city. Also, if you are a soft drink lover, bring your own or go to Peas & Pickles nearby - no soft drinks at this property.","1/21/2018"
"My family came to this hotel for my daughter's wedding. The first person we were introduced to was MJ and what a wonderful way to meet the culture of this hotel. Through our whole stay it seemed as if the whole hotel was at our disposal. We had many  vendors and visitors coming and going and the front desk never met a beat. We received a greeting from all workers whether in the lobby or on our floor or outside. Since employees do not wear uniforms it was hard to distinguish. Thank you for making what could be a stressful time a pure delight.  We will all be back.","9/18/2017"
"Amazing customer service. The decor and atmosphere is very organic and earthy. The customer service is great and promptly. They offer umbrellas at the entrance for rainy season. I love that there is a coffee shop next door that offers variety of pastries, smoothies, coffees..... The staff at the hotel doesn't have an assigned uniform which makes it a little difficult to differentiate from the rest. But otherwise, they are vey attentive and courteous!","4/5/2017"
"My husband and I stayed here for our one year anniversary this weekend. The front desk staff was very friendly and accommodating. Our room was amazing and the view was breathtaking. There was a room mix up and we received a complimentary wine and cheese board. We will definitely stay here again!","11/6/2017"
"1 Brooklyn Bridge is a place that is simultaneously an effortless extension of Brooklyn itself and also a sanctuary from the hustle and bustle of reality. I was fortunate enough to stay a night during its opening weekend and can't rave enough about the experience! Located right on the Brooklyn Bridge waterfront, it's close to almost all the major train lines, the ferry, the promenade, and some iconic restaurants (Grimaldi's, Juliana's, etc.) It's a short ride to the city but also removed enough to appreciate it as a whole--quite literally, because you really can't get views of downtown Manhattan anywhere else--I had an amazing view of the Statue of Liberty from my room! What really sets the hotel apart for me is that every detail stands for something. The concept of Brooklyn and green living is in everything you touch here. I was truly impressed by the amount of thought out into every single detail, from the moss plant in the room, to the hemp mattresses, to the coat hangers with poetry on them. Their robes are also made of a sweatshirt material and were the softest ones I've ever worn! In addition to the green, eco feel, this hotel is equipped with every piece of modern technology that you can think of. Each room comes with an iPad where you can control everything from room service to temperature. Their room keys are also made of reclaimed wood with chips, not magnetic strips--a much appreciated upgrade from regular key cards--so you can keep it next to your phone without fear of it becoming demagnetized. The hotel lobby also doubles as a beautiful lounge with a great selection of local beers/wines and craft cocktails. I also saw several pups downstairs so it's a very dog-friendly hotel. Service is also so incredible here. Everyone from the front desk to room service was friendly, polite, and made me feel like a really valued guest. All in all, I highly recommend 1 Hotel Brooklyn Bridge for a stay. Whether you're a tourist, a business traveler (they have great conference rooms too), or a native treating yourself, you will have an unique, immersive, and truly unforgettable experience!","3/5/2017"
"Customer service is amazing. Walked in and the people were so accommodating and friendly. Best cookie in dumbo:)","5/6/2018"
"Love the place.  Great view.  Definitely will go back only on special occasion","8/7/2019"
"We had stayed here while prepping for our wedding at nearby Jane's Carousel and it was THE best hotel experience we've ever had. I contacted the GM prior to our stay and she was amazingly helpful and reaffirmed our decision to recommend this hotel to our wedding guests. The hotel is absolutely stunning and our views from our suite were breathtaking.  The suite and the views served as the perfect backdrop for our pre-ceremony photos. Most importantly, the customer service was stellar! I had a ton of deliveries to my bridal suite, we had our first look photos on the rooftop, and used the tesla to check out our reception space.  Barring one rude staff member on the rooftop, EVERYONE was so kind and helpful.  Everyone knew my name and went out of their way to make sure I had a good experience.  Special shoutout to MJ. Thank you from The Millers and our wedding guests!","3/21/2018"
"Don't understand some the bad reviews... space is beautiful, view can't be beat.  Wait staff was attentive ( Aiden ). Security has to be tight, unfortunately it's the world we live in today. One star off for a very small bites/food menu.","7/25/2017"
"Beautiful hotel, courteous staff, good bar, good restaurant. The fire alarm at 1am sucked, but these things happen. I love the way the place is lit.  Linear indirect everywhere, it's just beautiful.  The whole design is really well considered. I checked in at around midnight, exhausted and cranky, but the host turned it around.  She was incredibly welcoming and friendly; completely changed my mood. I forgot toothpaste and they had to me in 5 minutes. The bar has an amazing view and a great selection of whiskey. All in all a great experience.","3/17/2018"
"One of my favorite hotels in New York City! The views are breathtaking! It has a sense of feeling as if you're at home. Friendly staff-- Remi helped us out when we had questions and was great! They have thought out about design and hospitality and you can sense it here. Will definitely stay here again.","3/4/2017"
"Came here on a Friday evening and there wasn't a line! Which is amazing because the views and atmosphere are unmatched but you would find yourself standing in line at any manhattan/Williamsburg rooftop! The vantage point of the rooftop is amazing as you are at eye level of the nearby BK bridge, what seems to be hovering over the East River and directly across from FiDi. Highly recommended for the rooftop enthusiast.","10/7/2017"
"I will start with what we loved (and we loved a lot!) This hotel is beautiful and the design of both the rooms and common spaces is unique and welcoming. This hotel is in a perfect location for exploring any area of NY, multiple close subway stops and the ferry is also close as well.The views of the Brooklyn Bridge and Manhattan steps from the hotel are also just incredible! We booked a DUMBO King, our view was facing another building, I requested a nice view when booking my reservation online however I knew that would not be guaranteed. The room felt large for NY standards, we have stayed in NYC hotels which felt like a jail cell because they were so small. This was not only spacious but a relaxing space to be, I especially loved the filtered water fountain (genius idea), the fact that you could actually open the window to get fresh air, and the IPad to control lights and view info about the hotel. The bed, sheets and shower were all great as well. As some have noted, there is an open layout to the bathroom, this was fine for us but obviously something to note. We had drinks at the Social Club on the 10th floor, service, drinks and views were all better than expected and I recommend checking it out. We also took advantage of the free Tesla outside that will take you within a few mile radius, our driver was so nice and it was cool to ride in a fancy car we would never be in otherwise. They do not advertise this at check in but it is on their site, if the car is sitting outside it is yours to hop into, no advance reservation needed. And now for the things that need some attention: -Cleaning service: We left our room at about 10am, came back at 245pm and room was still not made up. They did come by at 3pm but we were getting ready so opted out of service. I feel a hotel of this caliber should make up the rooms earlier in the day. -On our second night, we were awoken by an alarm at 1am. Someone came on to say it was a false alarm but we could not hear anything but mumbling because it was in the hallway, we called down. All was ok, but no apologies issued at check-out. -Neighbors (the market downstairs): Needs work, staff seems more interested in chatting with each other. Service seems pretentious and careless, and muffins/breads/coffee is mediocre and overpriced (you can't be both). -My sister wanted to pay to upgrade our room to one with a view as a late birthday present for me. She told me afterward that she called about 2 weeks before my husband and I were checking in and was told she would need to call the day of and would not be able to do this in advance. She called the morning we checked in and was told they were booked and she should have called in advance for a room with a view. So misinformation. Also, the hotel was not full and I know this because friends were going to join us and the day before we checked in I went online to see if there was availability, they had rooms available in every category. So a little annoying. -Check-out: At check-out we were not asked how our stay was at all and had to ask for the charges that were to be placed on our card. It was curt and robotic, and not in line with a hotel at this level. Overall, we enjoyed our stay because of the beauty of this hotel, comfort of the room, and perfect location and will be back in hopes that they work on some things.","3/16/2018"
"Horrible service. Went to the main bar twice and got ignored with couple of my friends, tickets might made them busy or just bad service. Next time just get your head up and say hello. Might give you 3 stars for bad service. Good luck.","9/2/2017"
"Loved going here to try a lavender cocktail and can't wait to go soon to get the Osprey drink! It feels like you are on vacation when you're not. Awesome spot to hang out and have drinks.","5/31/2019"
"I cannot say enough great things about this hotel. From the amazing views to the accommodating staff, everything about my stay was on point. Highly recommend.","6/15/2019"
"Really nice rooftop with a beautiful view. Good place to chill. The entry fee was $20 per person. I tried their Italian sausage in a bun. It was pretty good. Overall, would come here again.","8/6/2018"
"Pretty hotel.  Views to die for. We had the second nicest room in the hotel and they upgraded us to the best one - we had such high hopes. But the raves stop there. Terrible service.  Gave us the wrong room keys, with the wrong rooms on them - and we kept directing our friends to the wrong room. The keys never worked, they lost our brunch reservation, and refused to pick up our room service unless we put it outside the suite (but never asked us to do so). We called three times before they let us in on the joke. It's a great locale but has a long way to go before it's a five star.","12/9/2018"
"It's a ""Likkle"" pricey. However; I absolutely fell in love with this hidden gem! My friends and I had drinks at the restaurant in their lobby, and the drinks were amazing, our second round was able to be transferred into plastic cups so we could go take a tour of the rooftop bar. Isaiah was our bartender and showed us a great time for our our first visit! We got lost in good conversation, amazing drinks, and breath taking views of NYC''s Skyline. The rooftop does get a bit cramped after sundown, but they have plenty of room to accommodate guests in their lounges!","8/9/2019"
"Wow! This review is mostly for the rooftop bar, but also for the hotel in general. We went for some drinks on the roof and the view is incredible! The hotel is beautiful and well designed. Definitely rustic urban chic, which works really well in this area. The view is stunning and our tourist guests were very impressed. Sunday evening was complete!","10/22/2017"
"I went to 1 hotel last week and may I say I have never received better service in my life. A girl, I believe her name was Irma, was our server. Lovely sweet girl. She was a rockstar. I will definitely be coming back service again was amazing!!! Drinks were also great!","8/4/2020"
"This place was EXCEPTIONAL. I would give it 6 stars out of 5 if I could. We splurged on two nights at the hotel during our five day stay in New York, and was not only the best part of our entire trip, and although a bit pricy (I went for the Statue of Liberty room, the view was breathtaking) was completely worth every penny. ***Pay the extra money for the room with the view - we literally could have spent our entire time in Brooklyn in the hotel room, sipping coffee and enjoying the view***. The rooftop pool was great, and although ""outdated"" in some reviews, thought it was perfect and had the most epic views of the New York City skyline. Perfect for a relaxing afternoon, something that is difficult to find in such a busy city. Cocktails from the rooftop bar were great, and the coffee in the coffee shop/cafe in the lobby was the best we had from the ten or so coffee shops in the city we visited during our stay. We are huge coffee connoisseurs, so to us this says a lot. Location was also wonderful and close to the subway station when we arrived, as well as walking distance to everything. As someone who has worked in the hospitality industry for years including restaurants and high end hotels, this place seriously has it figured out. The temperature when you walk in the door, staff at the front desk and bellman who assisted us with our bags, lighting, decor, views and even the signature smell of the hotel which was pure perfection. I could go on and on, but to sum up my feelings on this place I'll tell you that it was one of the best and most unforgettable experiences of my life - truly making the trip what it was. When I return to Brooklyn for my next visit, this will absolutely be my first choice during my stay. Truly exceptional.","7/27/2019"
"Amazing stay and views of the iconic Brooklyn Bridge. The hotel is super cozy and you feel at home. It's pet friendly. Want to give a shout out to Melinda and Ivan. Amazing staff and super welcoming. Loved the shower!!","3/4/2017"

"We were at Dumbo Brooklyn Hanging out. We decided to walk into this hotel to see if it's a place we would like to stay. Door men greeted us very welcoming. That atmosphere was relaxing with the large lounge areas. It was relaxing scent and feel almost like a spa.  We strolled around and the staff was very welcoming.  They offered us complimentary beverages and apples.  Gotta say for not staying there it was inviting to be there. Looked up rooms and they are so nice. The roof top pool is awesome for the summer.  Definitely staying here next time.   The one  down is because I didn't actually stay here.  When I do. I expect it to be a full 5.","12/27/2018"
"Just celebrated our 20th anniversary of marriage. And it's been a year of change and new things. We left our three kids with our oldest daughter who just turned 18 yrs old, so yeah. For us it was a staycation but wow what an experience. Our room was on the 10 th floor and oversaw Dumbos core n the classic Manhattan bridge. An amazing view. The interior decor of the hotel was industrial rustic modern. They made full use of all the elements: greenery, Stone/concrete, salvaged wood, n iron. Everything was beautifully executed. The room was so comfortable and stylish, the shower was so inviting, we must of taken 4 showers in our two day stay. The restaurant Osprey complimented our stay. Staff was friendly n accommodating. Honestly, I was put into a sedated state, complete relaxation. The setting made for real intimacy. The best part for us was that we were only 30 minutes from home so we can easily go back for more. This place with its surrounding Brooklyn Bridge Park n iconic DUMBO neighborhood really captures the best of Modern Brooklyn at its best. Well worth a visit and stay!!!!","4/18/2019"
"They use Laz parking and they damaged my 2019 Dodge Ram back in November of 2019 and still have not paid to repair my truck","5/21/2020"
"My boyfriend and I stayed here for 2 nights. Our suite was simply amazing and the view was just unreal. From check in until check out, the front desk receptionist was polite, attentive and accommodating. I really appreciated the attention to detail (espresso maker, hair tie, lip balm, cozy socks and robe...the little things!) We travel quite frequently in and outside of the U.S and we're pretty discerning when it comes to hotels and this place did not disappoint! My boyfriend now refuses to stay at any other hotel in NYC, which is fine by me. Thank you 1Hotel for a dreamy stay.","4/11/2019"
"Nice and green rooftop but having a lunch a sunny day we request 2 times to have a cold beer and finally was fine but not enough. And later 2 gardeners were working around us and removing bags for bins. It seems that staff need more trainings in special for summer time.","6/6/2019"
"Arriving in the Dumbo area of Brooklyn by ferry on a summers day, we dropped into the hotel's rooftop bar. It was relaxed and welcoming, sparkling in the soft evening sunlight. And if drinks were a bit overpriced, breathtaking views over the river and the idea that we were staying for just the one compensated us for the few extra dollars spent.","7/2/2019"
"Great new 1 Hotel. Amazing views. Still working out a few bugs from just opening but the staff is great in making up for it. Roof top nor restaurant are open yet (June?) but the park and neighborhood are a great alternative. Running across Brooklyn bridge in the mornings is nice too. If you like other 1 Hotels, you'll love this","5/1/2017"
"Absolutely beautiful view. We spent a good 3+ hours at a reserved table from 4:30-7 and watched the sunset; visiting from Seattle just for the weekend and we came here post brunch in Manhattan and pre-Cityfox Live EDM fest in Williamsburg. Very loud party vibe struck up after we'd settled (a big family's birthday party was happening close by) this event. But between the quiet cold winter rooftop and the lounge with a perfect view of the sun setting, the bridge, and lower Manhattan's twinkle we were satisfied. We only ordered drinks and nuts because we weren't very hungry. The food menu was just okay, and the tab wasn't small by any means (we were only 2) + we got shoo'd out for a private party + overcharged ""mistakenly"" twice by our waitress when cashing out, but will definitely return based on the overall quality of the experience (fairly attentive and kind staff, view, comfy table, good drinks).","3/8/2020"
"Planned a staycation for my birthday. This hotel is awesome even down to the decor and design. I Got upgraded to a Brooklyn bridge suite king room. The floor to ceiling window with the view of both the Brooklyn bridge and Statue of Liberty was to die for! I made the best of my stay by visiting the spa and ordering in room dining. Overall I'm definitely pleased and will be back !","2/3/2019"
"Good things: amazing views of the Brooklyn bridge and the city and a great location. We've stayed in the Brooklyn Bridge King room-modern, industrial style, clean, and airy. Bad things: service absolutely, almost shockingly sucks! The check-in front desk people are inattentive and unconcerned. They checked us in 3 hours past our check-in time, didn't even apologize once. Tablet was missing from our room, we've asked them to get us one, they went to look for it and never came back. The overall impression of service is that you are bothering them and they do you a favor by even looking at you. I found it very shocking coming from a nice hotel; 0 hospitality, 0 customer service. We spent $500 for a one night room and we've been treated 10000000 better in any chain 2star hotel than in this hotel. Also, very confusing unlabeled shower handles. I understand that it's suppose to be modern, industrial, cool design, but what it means in reality that you either burn yourself with hot water or freeze with cold water, before figuring out how to work the handles.  Things should be design with guest's comfort in mind, not the other way! Good views do not minimize the shortcoming of this hotel. It's good concept but definitely needs major work in customer service department.","7/5/2018"
"The rooftop bar had an amazing view. Great vibe, cool people, nice staff at the door, delish drinks and good music. I went early and no wait!  Drinks are pricey, but it's NY, and Dumbo is a great place to come on a beautiful summer night.","8/12/2017"
"This review is strictly for our hotel stay and not for the rooftop or lounge. My boyfriend and I had a weekend staycation at 1 Hotel. I never ever write reviews because I'm lazy BUT our stay was so good I had to take the time out. The moment we stepped in the lobby we were greeted with a sort of fresh linen clean smell. AMAZING. Idk what kind of wall plug ins they use but they need to sell that! I used the pre-Check in option so when I got there all I had to do was pick up my keys. The staff was very friendly and informative. A staff member took our bags and walked us to our room. When we stepped in the room the view left us speechless! All we could say was ""wowww""! Since it was a ""treat yo self"" Mood we ordered room service. It came promptly. Oh! I didn't say the best part. So they have an iPad in every room that controls the lighting, heat, etc. and the lighting is very sexy. So basically you never have to get out of bed to control the heat or turn off the lights. They also have complimentary warm socks and complimentary tea and coffee. They provide comfy robes as well. The showers are amazing and they have high end body wash, shampoo and conditioner. I made sure to take an EXTRA long shower. When we ordered our room service they forgot one of the items but we called and it was quickly rectified. Overall our stay was exactly what we needed and we didn't have to go far. We are looking forward to coming back in the summer so we can experience the rooftop/pool.","1/14/2018"
"I LOVE this hotel. My room is amazing -- bright, spacious and modern. The service is  outstanding. Food delicious. While it is a haul to Manhattan, the space is fun and creative!","1/13/2019"
"What a bunch of scumbags.  They try to charge you 20 to go to the roof. Then they have a 75 and a 100 limit per person area.  On top of this  you order at the bar and they charge you gratuity.  NO ONE IS AWARE OF THSI!!  No one tells you and no sign so everyone is leaving a tip on top of the tip.  Then they are charging a 20% gratuity on drinks.  Shady ass hotel","8/24/2019"
"We stayed at the ONE Hotel in late May/early June.   The hotel is new and quite beautiful.  The location near the BB and the views of the Bridge and Manhatten are wonderful.   The hotel was recently opened and had a number of bugs to work out, particularly guest access to the Rooftop bar and pool which opened the week we were there, but the staff was great to help sort things out for us. In particular, all the concierges but especially JONATHAN SNIPES who are genuinely friendly incredibly helpful, and MUHAMMED, one of the staff who drives the hotel's ""shuttle""-- a Tesla-- is a great guy and very courteousl. The hotel is a 10 minute walk to the A,C and F Trains into Manhatten and the Bridge is close by if you have the time to stroll. We liked exploring Brooklyn and a nice alternative to frenetic Manhatten.  It is pricey for sure but if you want to treat yourself, this is a place to consider.","7/5/2017"
"Super disappointed in the service and lack of courtesy here. My boyfriend booked us a room as a surprise for my birthday. It's a huge deal because we haven't left our apartment for a long time considering quarantine. The room is gorgeous but the big selling point, the giant sliding glass door, is broken. It doesn't open. My boyfriend also paid for a bottle of champagne to be waiting in our room, and it isn't here. We were on the way down to the front desk when we ran into a helpful person working in housekeeping. She came and looked at our room and agreed the door was a problem. She called management for us and said someone would be up soon to move us and our bags to a new room. We eventually got a call from the front desk, and they said they could not move us, could not upgrade us, and could not send the bottle of champagne. We explained how important an occasion this is and that no one communicated any of this to us before we got here, and the most they offered was $25 hotel credit. Not even a bill credit/refund. I'm really shocked and sad that they would do so little to fix so many errors. Won't be back.","7/7/2020"
"Such a glamorous and modern hotel and restaurant. My husband and I just had a business meeting here last weekend and were able to reserve a last minute reservation for dinner. The restaurant hosts were pleasant and accommodating while also being complimenting. Just a fabulous second impression. I have also attended a Real Estate conference/event thrown at this hotel with clients and the entire day and evening was seamless and professional.","12/27/2018"
"Don't ever go here unless you want to get ripped off. My friend and I asked for a vodka rosé drink (not on the menu) and the bartender said she could make something for us. Normal cocktail prices on the menu are in the $16-$18 range. However the bartender made us our drinks and told us that that would be $50... $25 EACH!!!!!! Then, when I complained to the bar manager, rather than trying to appease an unhappy customer, he defended the bartender's choice of pricing. Don't EVER go here","6/2/2018"
"Wow, this place is on point such a wonderful spot to have a nice cocktail on the 10th floor overlooking New York and the Brooklyn bridge. If you need to get away excellent idea to stop and have a drink if you're in the hotel.","11/24/2018"
"Terrible service. The folks who work here are completely inattentive and seem more concerned with playing with their hair than helping their clients. Strongly recommend avoiding. There are much better places in New York.","7/4/2018"
"Williamburg Vale is so much better.","8/24/2018"
"Stayed at this hotel in the past and it was great. This time, not so much and as a result would never return and will stop recommending it to all my friends. I brought my boyfriend here as a birthday gift (not a cheap one!) and to be honest I've received better customer service at every hotel I've ever stayed at. Upon arrival, the room was not ready although check-in was at 3 PM. For almost $700 dollars, you expect a room to be ready on time or at the very least expect an extremely sincere apology and an offer for drinks or SOMETHING if there is a delay. When asked how much longer to wait, the woman at the desk was very clearly just repeating scripts that were given to her and offered no help, did not apologize and did not provide a time frame. Whenever I asked different staff for an update I was almost always met with an attitude. After pushing and pushing, our room was finally ready about 1 hour late (if we didn't keep complaining it likely would've been several hours as per the other reviews) and we were offered a bottle of wine to be brought up to our room right away to make up for the wait. The bottle of wine didn't come for 2 hours and only did when we followed up on it. When requesting toothbrush and toothpaste to the room, it took about 1 hour; I'd get faster service at a motel. Also, our filtered tap water was incredibly dusty and when we told the desk this they said they've never heard of this issue and would try to fix it but weren't entirely sure how. We were staying at a 5 star hotel and there was lots of dust visibly floating around in our water. The room is nice but doesn't make up for the complete lack of customer service. The pool is beautiful but the area is extremely crammed and not relaxing in any way. If you're lucky enough to get a chair by waking up at 7 AM, you will be next to a screaming baby and nearly on top of the guest next to you. While the other 1 hotels are a nice experience and the dumbo location is seemingly beautiful, I'd highly recommend considering other options before subjecting yourself to this hotel that finds hospitality to be a joke.","7/28/2019"
"Came here to go to the patio for the view of Manhattan + Brooklyn Bridge. The view is AMAZING but they charge $20 per person for it. The way to get up was quite confusing too. Some side door, the host draws a smiley face on your wrist with a sharpie, walk down the stairs to the basement, get on the elevator, etc.. too much extra steps but guess it's necessary for crowd control purposes as to not disturb the actual hotel guests. I would give this establishment a 3 star as the drinks were not great, made in plastic cups, BUT the view is just so good that it's worth it.","10/9/2018"
"For the city this is a beautifully quiet respite- all of the indoor greenery, the amazing scent of the lobby, the decor, and the views make it stand out! The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is that there are some things that can be improved upon. The staff is all super friendly and will go above and beyond to be helpful (which gets them 5 stars especially in NY) however- administratively there seems to be confusion and if you ask 5 different people questions about hotel specifics- you'll get a lot of different answers. Room service has never brought me orders covered, which I find a bit distressing as the food is traveling through a hotel, and after three stays here from Jan 2018-aug 2018- the spa steam room has never been open to my knowledge. I think with a little improvement this could be a 5 star city hotel and either way is def worth a visit!","11/5/2018"
"Beautiful rooms, beautiful lounge and views! But such horrible service for the price and I usually do Airbnb so I do not expect that much. If you asked the reception about your check in time or something else relevant they would look at you like you were an alien of some sort. Generally it seemed like they weren't working at a hotel! I would come back, if they got a huge bump up in service. But I definitely recognise the reviews that say they make you feel stupid at any request. So sad when you decide to splurge and pamper yourself!","5/30/2018"
"I cannot say enough nice things about this hotel. Customer service was the best I have ever had. The hotel is green and the rooms are well appointed.  My dog was welcome without any weird waivers or fees and they even gave him a bed, bowls and treats. Oh and the view? Absolutely amazing.","10/18/2018"
"Wonderful stay.  This was our first time at the Brooklyn location as we had stayed at the Central Park location before. Loved this location! It was my birthday and they made every effort to make this experience special.  The views are amazing (you cannot not beat this view anywhere in NYC), and service and room decor were fantastic . Will definitely come back for another date night .","1/28/2019"
"I don't even give bad reviews but I have to this time. We have stayed here before! We decided to come back for the 4th of July because honestly this hotel has the best view. The view is amazing. BUT they definitely need to change their whole staff. The service is horrible and the staff is very rude. When you spend $1000 a night u expect amazing service and amazing treatment, you will NOT get that there. Will not be staying there again! And they don't even have slippers! Pretty petty but again for that a month of money a night you'd expect more.","7/5/2019"
"Stayed here for two nights - one was the night of my wedding, and one was the night before so I could get ready in the room with my bridesmaids. The location, views, and room itself are amazing, but the lack of service was surprising given the price and profile of the hotel. Key issues to watch out for: 1) Whenever I placed an order on the iPad to bring something up to the room (extra hangers, plastic bags, extra water cups), it would take so long that I would need to call down to follow up. In some cases, the items never even arrived. 2) My larger recommendation would be to work on team members' intonation on the phone. Two times when I called down (once to ask about the Tesla and once to ask about a speaker), the way they turned down my requests made me feel like I was stupid for even asking for those items. Instead of being apologetic that they could not fulfill the request, they gave the impression that I was inconveniencing them in some way. This left a sour taste in my mouth, especially since the 1 Hotel is a more high-end place where you would expect good service. 3) I got conflicting information from different people, which was unprofessional and disappointing. The day before I checked in, I spoke to the concierge about being able to check in early and getting a specific room. He told me the room number and said there was no problem. Day of, I call again to coordinate arrival, and someone else informs me that I cannot check in early and I cannot get the room they had promised. Again, the person was not apologetic about the issue and made me feel ridiculous for even expecting to have the particular room I was told I would have. It was stressful, disappointing, and confusing.","5/20/2018"
"I am so impressed by Megan Peabody, the hotels concierge and her wonderful assistance and follow up that I can honestly say I have not had service like this in quite some time.  Aside from being kind to help me find local services, she is articulate , professional and went above and beyond. She is exceptional and a great asset to your hotel!  Thanks again Megan and 1 Hotel","2/7/2018"
"This hotel is amazing!!! Great location, amazing service provided by wonderful staff. This review is two years overdue, but better late than never right? My fiancee proposed to me at this hotel in 2018, and the experience still makes me cry happy tears. My fiancee coordinated the whole surprise proposal with the staff. I had no clue. I had been working 80 hours a week and was a walking zombie for Valentine's Day weekend but I love my guy so much I was going to make every effort to enjoy our time together. From the time we entered the hotel and checked in, we were treated like royalty. The room was beautiful and the view of the Statue of Liberty and downtown Manhattan was just beautiful!!! My fiancee had arranged to have flowers, champagne and strawberries in the room. He proposed and then told me he had made dinner reservations at The River Cafe. He said it had been really difficult to get a table but the 1 Hotel staff was very helpful in making the reservation happen. When we returned to our room from dinner there were tealight candles and flower petals all over the room. How freaking romantic is that?! My fiancee had coordinated that with the staff as well.  And to top it off it started to snow so the view of the snow over the East River was freaking amazing!!! I could believe the staff also made the snow happen, LOL. It was just an amazing weekend all made possible by people who work hard to create an experience for their guests. Thank you!!! The memories will last a lifetime.","2/14/2020"
"This review is only for the rooftop bar and not the hotel. I'm keeping it very simple and straight to the point. Bartenders aren't friendly at all when you ask them for a suggestion about drinks. If you depend on tips be mindful to provide friendly and welcoming customer service. I happened to bumped into the supervisor, a very young guy and gave him a suggestion and he basically didn't care so I ended up giving them minimum tip. Providing good customer service can make a huge difference. I won't be going there again anytime soon.","7/4/2018"
"NEVER AGAIN, Went to the hotel bar, bought 2 drinks $16 and $13 adds up to $29 doesn't it?  WRONG. $38? so my husband payed cash. After using my first grade math skills of basic addition I questioned the bartender. Keep in mind their was no receipt or bill provided to us . Just the unkempt bartenders word. Once questioned, she then stated they add 15% gratuity to bills because ""tourists don:t know"" Whelp, We were not tourists being born and bred in Brooklyn yet she didn't know this. what if we were???? So you will steal our money AND insult the very people you are serving. And the cocktail didn't taste as good as the description, leading me to believe she put too little or too much of something. We will never be back and hope this review finds other guests, travelers, patrons, paying customers that just because YOU put 15% doesn't mean WE have to PAY IT. And hopefully people will learn and not fall for it. BTW I myself have worked as a server /Bartender in NYC my whole life. It is my profession, and this is just unprofessional. I hope those couple of bucks from us helped you. This experience ruined what was a great Saturdate with my husband. Good thing I am reading The Art of Not Giving A F@ck.","8/13/2019"
"Do not take your wedding party to this hotel. The bar closes at midnight and the walls of the rooms are too thin to even have normal conversation without complaints from neighboring rooms. The wedding party rooms should've been clustered together. And you had better stay there with a close friend because the shower walls are clear glass and the toilet stall has smoked glass but there is no privacy. The security people were overbearing and Omnipresent. Room service charges not only a gratuity but a delivery fee, adding much to the cost of the food and all from room service.","6/25/2017"
"This hotel is super nice and has amazing views of the Brooklyn Bridge and Manhattan skyline. However, I have stayed twice and both times had horrible service at the rooftop bar, the pool bar and the extremely overpriced restaurant on the main floor. We had to eat on the main floor (The Osprey) because one night of our stay, the entire rooftop bar was rented out the whole evening and guests were not allowed to go up. Also, both times I've stayed, check in has taken a long time and there has been something wrong with the room (broken shampoo bottles on shower floor once and a broken closet door which meant that the closet light was constantly on). Very pretty hotel but the service I've received doesn't match the price I've paid to stay.","5/31/2019"
"A litte dissappointed that this eco friendly hotel carries plastic in their coffee shop.","4/22/2018"
"Review is for the rooftop bar, which was great and had amazing views. Drinks were pricey, my avion and pineapple with lime cost $17 but with a view like theirs, you definitely won't be complaining too much. The staff were friendly and accommodating and made us feel welcome.","8/18/2017"
"The rooftop view is beautiful. And the hotel décor inside is beautiful. But I had a terrible experience with one BALD BARTENDER. I can't not say something. This guy charged me $15 more than what I had ordered and when I corrected him he charged me again for the correct amount but never refunded my money. I waited a few days thinking that it might show up later (I even tipped him more than 18% despite his bad attitude). A couple of days later, I called the hotel and spoke to the accounting department where I found out that this fucking asshole gave himself a 20% tip with the incorrect amount and never refunded my money. The hotel staff was really nice and understanding. They sent me an email with the receipt which showed how much he tipped himself and said they would refund me. BUT THEY DIDN'T. So, eventually, I just had to call my bank and dispute the charge. The whole thing was annoying. It wasn't only that I was charged too much but that I was charged twice, plus the asshole had the audacity to tip himself. My advice is, go there. It's a fun place with a beautiful view. but just be careful what they're charging you.","8/31/2017"
"I'm writing about the hotel room, not the rooftop bar, which was spectacular. We were there for a wedding, and experienced substantial delays in checking in.  No one would listen to us when I plead to be let into a dirty room, so I could shower and dress.  We were finally admitted with less than 1 hour to go before the ceremony at 5 pm. The room was architecturally interesting, but non-functional.  No ironing board in room.  The chair was painful to sit in (older adults with back or knee problems will hurt themselves).  The lighting was totally inadequate to see yourself to do your hair or makeup.  It took a hunt to find the blower-dryer, which is hidden in a basket to the left of the closet.  The only mirror is by the sink, so if you're sharing with another adult, expect to be crowded.  The bathroom walls are crystal clear, so you'll need to be on very good terms with your roommate...The bathrobe is made of material that looked like a repurposed old gray tracksuit. On the other hand, the bed was comfy.  Both of us got a robe, and there was fresh fruit available from 7 am to 7 pm near the elevator. The room had a nesspresso machine, but not a coffee pot.  I guess I'm too focused on comfort, instead of trendiness.","9/6/2017"
"Best hotel I've ever stayed at. Beautiful views, comfortable beds, and great amenities. Plus it's a green hotel! Recycling bins in each room, living plants everywhere, and environmentally friendly finishings throughout. It's majestic!","7/11/2018"
"One of my favorite hotel experiences. From the minute you enter you have to ask yourself .... can I afford this? This place looks too nice .... the decor and artwork... the trees hanging from the ceiling ! Remarkable and not found in any other hotels! DOGS!!! They allow dogs! No Extra fee? What! Amazing! Rooms are pricy but well worth it compared to other hotels. Finishes and linens are soft and Lux ! HIGHLY RECOMMEND","5/11/2018"
"If I could give this hotel a 10 Star I would. So deserving, great customer service from the entire staff. From the bellmen, front desk, cafe, restaurant and hotel roof top bar. Everyone was extremely pleasant, welcoming, and had a great attitude. The room was spectacular, view stunning and such an amazing stay. I highly recommend the Brooklyn 1 hotel as a home away from home stay. Will definitely be coming back and staying for future travels.","7/5/2018"
"Quality hotel for the price. Stunned by NYC views in December even as a native NY! Stayed overnight and upon checkout realized I forgot an item while waiting for valet, after surrendering keys. Quickly teamed up with security and they brought me upstairs to retrieve my item. Very professional staff.","12/18/2019"
"This is undoubtedly the most beautiful view in all of New York. Very friendly staff, and great food option. Also a very hip and laid back hotel while maintaining professionalism.","11/18/2019"
"This property fires on all cylinders.  The design and architecture of this hotel alone are a reason to stay, eat and drink here, not to mention the view, the vibe, the quality of the staff, the experience!  I mean, world class from tip to tail!  Also, their eco friendly mission aligns with my goals, which is also a plus.  An absolute gem!  I can not wait to explore their other properties.","9/26/2018"
"This Roof top bar has amazing views of Manhattan and Brooklyn Bridge, also a really good interiors design. Besides that, this bar is the worst bar I ever been to, there's not many liquor choices nor good music, they're cost per drink is round $16-$18. Waiters that work there wasn't very friendly, also they charge a ""service fee"" if you wanna sit down in certain area, I mean come on it's a bar not clubs. there's tons of good bars in city I would encourage you to go to this one if you trying to have so fun.","9/25/2018"
"Outstanding views. Need reservations for any of the nearby restaurants. Recommend Cecconi's on the water with again fantastic view of the Brooklyn bridge, the city and water/boats going by. Don't expect to sleep well (why I didn't give it 5 stars). Very loud, noises heard from inside the hotel as well as the boats coming in and their horns. Staff is impressively nice. Hotel rooms are very nice, showers, excellent. I would recommend staying for one night for the experience.","6/30/2018"

"Seriously, if i had a dollar for every man-bun faux hipster in the lobby and bar area i would be a zillionaire. PLUS the rude staff manning the door to the bar acting like it was just way too too much trouble when we asked where the ladies room was... THEN to top it off, take the ELEVATOR down to the UNISEX BATHROOM? WTH? IF I WANTED TO PEE WITH MEN I WOULDVE STAYED HOME WITH MY FAMILY. SORRY, BUT SO NOT A TREND TO FOLLOW. ONLY nice staff was barman who constantly asked if we needed anything...Unless you feel the need to be around overpaid, overpriced millennial, who i am guessing is the target clientele...catch an Uber and go elsewhere........","7/17/2018"
"I had the greatest time ever at this hotel! The staff was patient, always attentive and never failed to make my girlfriend and I feel like we were at home. Everything from the neighborhood to the eco-friendly aesthetic made this an unforgettable stay. Amazing food and drink menu as well! A truly one of a kind experience that I will recommend to all of my friends!","3/16/2017"
"The Rooftop bar was our reason for visiting.  Amazing view.  Our waitress wasn't the best but Gabriel stepped in and picked up the slack.  We had a cheeseburger and lobster roll.  Burger was A+. Lobster roll was good.  Pretzel was amazing.  Beer and wine were great.  The view is absolutely unbelievable.  Manhattan, the Brooklyn bridge the river.  All amazing.  I recommend you find this place and check it out.  Saw the hotels rooftop pool as well.  Wasn't a guest so couldn't go in but looked pretty cool with a view of lady liberty and south manhattan as well as the bridge.  Which reminds me the front desk staff were slightly rude I think cause I wasn't a hotel guest but they sent us all the way around the building outside when we could have just walked through a door.  They still couldn't dent the 5 stars though.  Thanks Gabriel.  You da man.","6/26/2018"
"Came out with my husband for my birthday, stayed Dec 20-24 . It was our first time in NY . Views were AMAZING . Some staff was friendly not all. We didn't get offered their complimentary car like most couples who were checking in @ the same time as us. Our last day here we requested a late checkout , when the cleaning lady came we told her we requested a late checkout and she kept coming back even though we had given her the time we were supposed to be leaving & we just felt so rushed. Anyway we finally checked out but left our bags there bc our flight was later. When we got back my husband realized he left his Gucci slides in the room . When he inquired if he could go get them, one guy immediately said "" I'll go check for you "" came back and said they weren't there. So then my husband insisted to let him go up there and they were gone. We checked all our luggage and they weren't in there. We also checked with security and they said no1 turned anything in . So how did they "" mysteriously "" disappear. A- it was housekeeping B- it was the first guy that went to check and probably moved them out of there. Either way whoever it was , was very unethical. So sad too because it's Christmas time. Amazing views don't make up for theft.","12/24/2018"
"Easily my favorite among all the hotels I've stayed at this year.  Modern design. Rooms are spacious, extremely clean, and artistic.  In-room dining, and affiliated cafes and restaurants are delicious and reasonably priced. Close to a lot of restaurants in town if you are willing to walk for 7-8 minutes. I am a huge fan of this hotel, and will recommend it to anyone who is visiting Brooklyn/NYC.","12/20/2017"
"I waited from 5:30:6:45 last evening in line to gain access to the rooftop terrace/bar. The view is spectacular. Really amazing. I noticed several parties coming up to the rope and being allowed in. When I inquired about reservations I was told,they must be made online. No such portal is on the website. I observed a roped off reserved seating area and inquired about it and was told reservations only and there's a minimum spend. But the person couldn't explain any further. Just said I had  to go online. So I called  and was given an email address for Ian. I sent message early this morning. It's now 7:50 PM and I haven't heard anything yet. When I called and asked for him I was told he was not accessible by phone. Only email. OK, but I just wish he would kindly respond to my email questions. I do intend to be bringing several friends real soon, maybe even planning a larger group, but I have no idea what to tell people about pricing/minimum spend requirements. I do think it would improve customer relations if such information was readily available.  I do understand their desire to keep,it exclusive. OK, but don't keep information secret. I do intend to go and treat myself to a night there in the near future.","8/6/2017"
"They don't care about guests, bartenders don't know how to make a margarita, they are arrogant, the waiter came to take the order at the table with the hands in his pockets! They should hire better employees!! That's all!","10/2/2017"
"The view at the hotels rooftop lounge is unlike any other.... The drinks are were not good and very watery by the time the server had brought them over, but the food was very good! The service at the rooftop is also decent but not great! The prices for drinks and food were considerably very low. In the $10-$25 range for food and $10-$16 for drinks. That being said, it makes zero sense that they would require a $100 per person order minimum to sit on a particular side of the rooftop!! Your drinks are too u set priced for one person to have a $100 minimum. Let's say you order they're amazing burger at $25 and a $15 cocktail, you have to leave smashed in order to sit on the desirable side. If the drinks were $18-$25 a piece and apps started at a higher price point, this would make sense. The other side only requiring $50 per person was far more reasonable. But like I said, the drinks were not great (coming from a nyc bartender of 10 years), the service was not good but the food was pretty good.","7/5/2019"
"One of the best hotels I have stayed in.  The lobby is gorgeous.  We stayed in a king bridge view, and there is not a better view of the city.  The bar offers amazing views with great drinks.  Tad on the expensive side but not out of the ordinary for a nyc hotel bar.  The bed was extremely comfortable.  The bathroom was gorgeous, however, two minor issues.  The shower is very small (because of the bath tub) and the toilet is awkwardly positioned.  The staff are amazing.  The food as the restaurant was also delicious with great views of the park.","12/23/2017"
"Recently a friend and I were walking across the Brooklyn bridge when the sign for the rooftop bar of the 1 Hotel caught our eye. We eventually took the trip back once the weather warmed up so we could take advantage of the rooftop. When you're up on the roof, the views are incredible! You're able to see down from the New York harbor all the way up Manhattan. Drink prices aren't unreasonable for a rooftop bar compared to most places in the city, although we did end up ordering food, which was more expensive than we wanted for a burger and fries. If you're in the DUMBO area, the 1 Hotel is definitely worth checking out to grab drinks and sit outside!","6/7/2018"
"I've actually never been to the hotel but I had to interact with staff members today. Our company rented meeting space for an Offsite. I had a bottle of champagne delivered to the hotel on behalf of someone to one of the attendees for their birthday. When I called the concierge desk to confirm it was delivered, Jonathan went above and beyond to assure that it was received by the guest. He was very professional and nice. I can say the same about everyone I spoke with. From this experience I will definitely stop by to at least have drinks. Great customer service is hard to come by. When I receive it, I'm always very appreciative.","4/6/2018"
"TERRIBLE PLACE THEY DONT EVEN DESERVE 1 STAR. 7/30 late afternoon, my friend and I went to the roof top for a complimentary drink and we received the most horrible service. The waitresses were very rude! They gave us attitude when they talked to us, they gave us dirty looks and tried avoiding us when wanted to purchase a meal. Then when I requested my bill they took 20min with my card & that made me feel very uneasy. When ever I would look back to see what's taking so long the waitress would just stare back from the bar and give me a dirty look. So be aware when they take your card. Who knows what they did to mines, I requested a new card right after that because I don't trust those people at all. It doesn't take that long to swipe a card! And they weren't even busy which was making it more suspicious. When me & my friend were about to leave we asked where the bathroom was and one of the guys showed us the way (they were in all blackish grayish suits I believe they were the guards). When we got to the bathroom we told him thank you and figured he would let us be. HE WENT INTO THE BATHROOM WITH US. His excuse was ""this place is unisex"". That still doesn't give him the right to be in there with us making us feel uncomfortable, let alone we are minors! We went to the corner of the bathroom and he moved between the mirrors where he could see us. HE WAS WATCHING US USE THE BATHROOM. I can't believe that this ""4.5star"" hotel has that kind of sick people working there. When we were leaving he followed us into the elevator and he kept on getting closer to us (the elevators are pretty big too) & he asked for our personal information! SICK AND UNPROFESSIONAL. Then he continued to try and talk to us and followed us on our way out of the hotel, he didn't stop until we got onto the street. PLEASE BE AWARE OF THIS. I don't want anything bad happening to any of you. This place does not deserve anyone's money and it surely doesn't deserve 4.5stars. Very unprofessional, I did not feel welcomed, I DID NOT FEEL SAFE here at all.","7/30/2018"
"Ok, this is one of the BEST hotel experiences I've ever had! I'm VERY picky when it comes to hotels, and this one deserves 6 stars if I could! We stayed in a skyline suite (room 504), for 2 nights, arriving on 3/13/2017 (during the expected blizzard). Our room was amazing, the size, the amenities, the view, the BED, the bathroom! When I go to Vegas I stay at the Encore in case you're wondering how picky I am.  The staff was incredibly friendly, and very accommodating! Yes, it's pricey, but it's actually worth the price! We watched a movie in the viewing room, they made homemade hot chocolate, have fresh fruit by the elevator, a free local ride in a Tesla! I could go on and on! The only down side was the service at the little cafe, the staff there were not very organized, made mistakes and forgot things and I had to find my completed order at different ends of the counter---on both visits (EXCEPT for an awesome young man with dark curly hair who helped us above and beyond on 3/14/17 in the AM, wish I knew his name to give him credit!). However, even with this one problem area, I still would give them a rating of 6 stars, and I am hard to impress! Try them for yourself!","3/15/2017"
"We came here with no expectations. Managers Andie and Lynn made us feel like royalty. We are from  this south and understand hospitality. Brooklyn and 1 Hotel rocks!!  Thank you!!","10/18/2017"
"5 star rooftop bar ***** Great ambience and amazing views of Manhattan skyline! Definitely a great place to visit during the summer","10/17/2017"
"A truly wonderful new hotel! Staff is friendly, great views, great location. Can't wait for the restaurant to open in a few weeks.  The design is modern, tasteful, and not overdone.","2/26/2017"
"If you're looking for an amazing hotel to stay at in Brooklyn look no further than Hotel 1! We stayed with our kids and dog, we all had a great time. For the kids there's the park, with skating, basketball, handball & soccer, playgrounds, bikes, a carousel and the best pizza in all of NYC!! As for the dog, the largest dog run in NYC is 1 block away! Now for the hotel, the rooms we had were a one bedroom suite and a double. Both rooms were to die for! The views in both rooms were killer. The suite was a very big corner room with a couch, chairs and a hammock on one side and bed and bathroom on the other. The rooms are decorated with an earthy chic and very comfortable. The hotel is not totally finished yet but there is a bar and lounge in the lobby and a coffee shop. We ordered room service and the food and service was really good as well. It is the nicest hotel in Brooklyn by far, with the best best view and vibe.","3/7/2017"
"Great new hotel!  All sustainable.  Beautiful.  Woke up to a gorgeous view of the water and a snow covered park.  The bar was fabulous and the staff couldn't have been more friendly.  Would definitely come back.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!","3/16/2017"
"pretty lovely place. the moss everywhere absolutely kicks a**. i found the name to be quite redundant. you could've just called it ""Hotel Brooklyn Bridge"", never expected there to be more than 1 hotel on site.","5/29/2019"
"Went to the rooftop bar, and it is great place to lounge at. The view from up there is gorgeous!","10/6/2017"
"Visited this beautiful rooftop last Sunday evening. You are able to view the Statue of Liberty and a stunning skyline of manhattan and the Brooklyn bridge. We ordered the guacamole and lobster rolls which were mouth watering. The service was phenomenal, Gabrielle was attentive and suggested two great cocktails for my boyfriend and I. Can't wait for my next visit!","7/18/2017"
"We stayed at the hotel for our wedding, along with some members of our family and wedding party.  The space is beautiful, and our rooms were comfortable and lovely.  The majority of the staff was also amazing and kind. The reason why we're rating it 3/5 stars is because of the disorganization at check-in and check-out.  This was particularly stressful because it was our wedding.  One of our wedding party was told morning-of that they can check in at 12PM.  When they arrived at 12, they were told the room was not ready and weren't able to check in until 3PM (regular check-in).  Our room and another wedding party room wasn't ready until almost 4PM, and we had to get ready and prep for our rehearsal dinner at 6PM.  We ended up wandering around in a ball of anxiety.  The concierge was kind and offered us drinks and food, but that didn't help us less worried about being late to our own rehearsal dinner. We faced similar problems at check out when I gave two bag check tickets and one valet ticket to the front desk.  One set of bags arrived 30 minutes later, and the lady at the desk completely forgot to ask for the second set of bags even thought I reminded her after waiting 20 minutes.  Another staff member finally came over and asked if we needed help, and helped us locate our bags.  By the time we got out, our valet car was nowhere to be found and took another 15 minutes to locate. In conclusion, it's a wonderful hotel, but can be stressful if you're on a tight schedule.  Hopefully they will be able to work things out with time.","8/18/2017"
"Gorgi hotel in the most CRACKIN part of town. Smells like Hollister inside.","3/1/2017"
"Everything was perfect! Especially the view at the top! Breathtaking! Drinks where on the pricy side but the view made up for it. Definitely a must see! Only thing I didn't like was there were no waiters that came to you when you sat down you had to walk to the bar.","8/11/2017"
"View from the roof is the best I've ever seen of the Manhattan skyline. Cool decor. Decent food. STAFF IS AWFUL. Rude, unprofessional, inexperienced. Have been twice because I really wanted to like it but will never go back.","8/2/2017"
"This is truly a 5 Star Hotel all the way! From the moment we want in we are greeted with a smile, everything is so clean and fresh! We got a one bedroom suite and the view was breathtaking omg love it! We had a beautiful patio which we enjoyed lovely breakfast. The rooftop view is stunning as well. The food was good price is decent also. And the pool is finally open! Can't wait to try it. Also my husband needed an iron and they got it for us right away and then I needed a flat iron because I forgot mine and I wanted to go in the pool and they got it right away. Talk about service!! Excellent ! We will definitely be back!!","7/31/2017"
"The bartenders in the hotel are the most careless people I've ever experienced. It was not busy at all (almost dead) and all my friend and I asked for were 2 drinks and fries. We waited forever for the fries and come to find they never put in the order. Finally got them and asked for extra sauces and they forgot to bring those also. Both times showed no care or interest. We weren't asking for a lot, but don't forget to do your job and then act like we are asking too much","10/6/2018"
"Disappointing and unprofessional rooftop bartender service. All other staff  in hotel and bar area were friendly and professional. Bartender could use some education on customer service and mixology. Drinks were subpar and service extremely rude and unprofessional. There are better places to spend your time and money. Poor value.","8/23/2018"
"An incredible hotel and was very pleased with everything! A very friendly staff and very beautiful hotel. The room was amazing and I haven't had such a great bed in all my life's travels. This is the place to stay if you visit the area!","8/1/2017"
"This is a review for a hotel stay. Booked a king room with a bridge view for our honeymoon. Woof. Issues (from major to pretty minor) as follows: (1) Phone lines did not work so we could not order room service or anything else. To report room issues, we had to go downstairs and deal with someone who is stressed out (and not professional) from dealing with unimpressed guest. All we wanted to do was enjoy breakfast in bed post-wedding! We even called 1 Hotels' customer service line which is off site using our cell phones to inquire about possible resolution and not only could they do nothing for us, they were also pretty rude about it. (2) The iPad in the room did not work. We could not access the guest services button, so we could not see any hotel offerings. If you clicked the option, it would say ""No guest. Retry?"" And then lock up for 10 minutes and then you couldn't use the iPad at all, even to turn off the lights. (3) The fire alarm went off at 1 AM. Thereafter, the building's Fire Marshall made near incomprehensible announcements over the course of a half hour before finally shutting up. (4) Rooms felt a little dingy with signs and instructions pasted in the room missing letters. (5) Concrete floor in bathroom is like ice. You had to slip on outside shoes to be able to walk on it comfortably. (6) We asked for a replacement pillow, which took them over 30 minutes to deliver. It did not arrive with the pillow case on it. Instead, the guy wanted to come in and get the pillow ready in our room and my husband had to keep telling him no we will handle. The guy would not take. The hint. (7) The window for the balcony was not easy to open. You have to use all your weight to get it to move. If you're not in shape, good luck. (8) If I had stayed here with anyone other than my husband, I would have been irritated because the bathroom set up offers no privacy. Couples only! We checked out the next morning as soon as we had showered, preferring the comfort and luxury of our 1-bedroom apartment to the job they're doing here. Tried to enjoy a special treat to celebrate our marriage but 1 Hotels had other plans for us. :/ Staff quality needs to be improved. You cannot charge what you do and have staff this inexperienced and unprofessional. Most of the problems would be forgivable, and attributed to a young hotel working out the kinks if you had quality staff who knew how to smooth things over with guests. You don't tho.","3/13/2018"
"Great Hotel with incredible views, staff. Johnathan, the concierge was so nice and knowledgeable along with the front desk staff. Michael who greeted us at front door was most helpful. The views, comfortable bed, and incredible lobby made us enjoy our trip to no end.  Our room was immaculate and beyond comfortable. Staying at hotel for a soft opening, I thought the hotel ran exceptionally smooth, except for the cafe. I'm sure they will figure it out but it was a repeating factor over the weekend of long lines for a very simple cup of coffee.  We will definitely stay at hotel again, would absolutely recommend the hotel to friends. We had a wonderful stay!!!!","3/6/2017"
"21 and up for the rooftop any day. Used to come here many time on Sunday lunch with the kids. Always a shame when families are not welcome anymore.","6/24/2018"
"The look, the service, the vibe...everything was absolutely on point. I was there for five days and wanted for nothing. I will stay here again when I go back to NY.  Beautiful scenery, great bar at top, great restaurant. Love the Tesla that takes you to local places.","2/24/2019"
"I cannot say that the hotel was not beautiful, but then again it is a new hotel.  The service was definitely a 2.  When we came back to our room at 2pm it hadn't as of yet been cleaned. We specifically spoke to the manager to say that we were going out and expected to come back to a clean room.  2 1/2 hours later we came back and the room was still not clean, this was 17:30pm.  Trying to get ready for an event was not easy at this point.  I had to go down speak specifically to the manager.  Then the Housekeeping manager called us and started to argue with us as to why the room wasn't cleaned.  After reminding them who the client was they came to clean however we were in the middle of trying to get to this event on time.  The shower had a large stand for shampoo etc and a glass hour glass that fell down three times while we were there.  Once again they came each time to fix it while we were trying to get ready for another event.  The shower was never washed down and luckily we did not cut ourselves on the glass.  No apologies were forthcoming.  Now I have received a $150.00 charge to my credit card that was never used and am trying to get that settled.  Seems they cannot find me or my friend in their system and after spending 30m on the phone with them they will have to call me  back.  Sorry to say that if you want a great experience with the customer satisfaction and not just the ambiance this is not the hotel for you.","1/15/2019"
"We rented one of the penthouses. It was beautiful, modern, simple. Staff was pleasant. We tried to go to a yoga class but the instructor never showed. In apology we were given drink vouchers for the cafe. We decided to buy smoothies but after two friends used theirs, the manager stopped the third and wouldn't honor the voucher. I was mortified when I found out and called the front desk who promised to send a free smoothie to the room but never did. Same thing happened with towels we requested for the room. There was loud music past midnight coming from the 10th floor bar, however the front desk asked the DJ to lower the volume and it seemed like he/she followed through, which was very helpful. The gym was simple and basic. Overall it was a beautiful, new hotel with some kinks to work out. The staff aside from the cafe were all friendly and kind. The main issue was due to my friend being publicly denied use of the voucher by a manager, which 1) embarrassed her 2) upset me, her host & the one who'd passed along the voucher. We were not trying to get ""free"" drinks, the staff had offered them to us since we waited for the yoga class for 30 minutes. --You can see this still irks me ;-) BUT again overall we enjoyed our stay. We are from NYC and just wanted to enjoy our city as a staycation, and the hotel lent itself to that.","4/23/2018"
"Amazing hotel in every possible way - the view and the room layout and amenities but mostly the amazing staff. A shout out to the best concierge, Jonathan, who helped me with lots of last minute planning for a ship board wedding. I will definitly plan on coming back.  Thank you for everything.","10/3/2018"
"Horrible service, don't waste your money. I live in Brooklyn and decided to stay here for a night to support a local business while celebrating my birthday. We are 4 adults, 35-40yrs old, drinking wine and having a laugh and had someone from the front desk come to the door at 1045pm to say we were making too much noise for the ""sick"" guests next door. 15 mins later a very rude person from the front desk called and said this was a final warning.  The whole experience was disgusting and the hotel overall is cheap and desperate looking. No true NYers would ever go here and no one from any city ever should.","6/2/2017"
"This hotel is phenomenal! The staff is incredibly friendly and on top of things. The hotel is not only serene, but has some great technology features. If you are looking for a bit of nature in the city, this is your hotel. And the views are perfect!","10/2/2018"
"Don't stay as a guest.  Stay elsewhere and just visit the rooftop. This place doesn't care about their guests. They only care about the people purchasing bottle service by the pool.  My husband and I do a staycation in NYC a couple of times a year and this was our least favorite experience. We headed up to the roof around 5. I sat on a chair for 10 minutes when a rude staff member with pink hair frantically told me to get off the chair because someone reserved it.  As I was gathering my stuff she actually picked up my shoes and threw them at a table nearby assuming they belonged to someone else. It turns out no one came to sit at that table.  I guess that's how they treat their guest spending money on a room. Also, the scene upstairs gets trashy.  I went to use the bathroom before dinner and there was vomit and feces in two different stalls. It was disgusting.  They couldn't accommodate a check out extension of 30 minutes. They made no acknowledgement of our special occasion. It's almost like you should be thankful you get to spend your money here. The only good thing about this place is the rooms are a cool design and eco friendly but I wouldn't get wrapped up in that.","8/6/2017"
"Went there for thanksgiving dinner. Service was excellent and food was very good. Would recommend the restaurant for dinner.","11/22/2018"
"i came on labor day monday for the rooftop. wasn't allowed by the pool because i wasn't a hotel guest, but from what i did see, the pool isn't a reason to stay here. but i do think i had a bad view - instagram photos from the other side of the pool are nicer than where i was standing. the views are okay from the side of the rooftop for non hotel guests. the bartender was quick to take my order for drink & food. i had the poke bowl, which was good. i didn't care for the mayo, but still mostly enjoyed it. also had sangria, which was good. didn't stay long because there wasn't much else to do. there was no music. the bathrooms are coed, which i don't mind but was surprised to find for a really nice hotel. not sure i would come back, but would definitely say is worth a try.","9/9/2018"
"I love the 1 Hotel in Miami, so my husband and I decided to try the Brooklyn location for a weekend away in NY.  I can't say enough about how much we loved the location!  It was our first time staying in Brooklyn with the intention to explore the area but also spend time in Manhattan.  This is the ideal spot to maximize just a few days in town.  It's surrounded by great food, friendly people, easy access to the city, and shopping in all directions. The hotel itself is beautiful, thoughtfully designed, and offers unbelievable views of the Manhattan skyline.  I loved running along the water and having access to the riverfront park.  We will definitely plan to bring the kids next trip! I am rating this 4 stars instead of 5 because one of the reasons we booked here, instead of the Wythe Hotel, is because of the rooftop bar.  We had heard how beautiful the views are and how great the scene is - and it was.  What the hotel does not mention is that the roof is operated as a separate entity from the hotel. We went to the roof for an early happy hour on a gorgeous Friday, so it was packed. We walked around to the side, where there was lounge seating extending around the entire back of the roof and up by the pool.  I would say 98% of the seating WAS available.  We explained to the ""bouncers"" not letting people in that area that we were staying at the hotel, so he let us pass.  We sat down with our drinks and were approached not even 10 minutes later by another man asking if we had reservations to sit in the area.  We looked around very confused and explained the situation.  He unapologetically replied that guests don't have access to that part of the hotel unless they call the roof directly to make reservations.  He told us to go down and see the concierge to do this.  When we asked the front desk, they told us to go up and talk to the hostess on the roof.  What a mess! We left and ended up getting a call from the hostess on the roof saying that she could make us a reservation, but there would be a $200 minimum.  I had to commit to the minimum AND a time to access the roof.  Forget the minimum because we did not care at all about the cost, we wanted to sit at a table on the roof of the hotel we were staying at.  Just a real bummer because we went to the Wythe and it was just such an extreme opposite experience and we weren't even staying there. In my opinion, as a guest of the hotel, you should have access to the entire property.  Otherwise, it should be made clear on the site there are exceptions. This review is not meant to complain because the positives of the hotel strongly outweigh the negatives, but I do hope this helps other travelers!","10/1/2017"
"Even though I am a Brooklyn resident, I still get blown away by this view. The rooftop here has unbelievable views of the skyline. When you walk in the lobby doors of the hotel, it smells absolutely amazing. They pay attention to detail and the staff is always so welcoming. They have great cocktails on the roof and the bar menu for food is really good as well. Def recommend whether you live here or not!","10/9/2017"
"We had an incredible experience here. After a canceled flight and awful day getting stuck at JFK, the staff here went out of their way to accommodate us at 3:30 AM.  More than that, when we arrived they were spectacularly sweet - from the gorgeous room to the amazing service.  Doesn't get any better than this place.  BOOK IT!","4/18/2018"
"This place easily has the best view in all of New York. A full view of lower Manhattan and several bridges too.  I like the food ok for bar food but really it's the atmosphere and service that makes this place special.  The bartender Abraham was really sweet and took great care of us, he was super attentive and friendly he knows how to keep you entertained while maintaining his professionalism. His cocktails were truly over the top. Gotta say, I don't usually post reviews on yelp, I'm guilty of using this app just to read other people's reviews but after I visited 1 Hotel I felt I had to say something specially after seeing some bad reviews about this place. So if you are in the area you should definitely try this place !","9/10/2018"
"We attending a wedding brunch. Food was tasty. Service was excellent. The view is wonderful. However there is NO baby changing station in this entire hotel. I understand that this hotel does not cater to families but it would be nice to have that courtesy in any bathroom at all. Or even a family bathroom that can be used easily for diaper changing out of a public setting.","6/17/2017"
"While the view is amazing...the service at the rooftop bar isn't. Drinks and food are overpriced and mediocre. Waitress messed up the food order...and bus boy was constantly trying to clear our table to the point that we had to ask them to stop hovering. Also, what is this 5% administration fee tacked onto the bill in addition to the 20% gratuity?","6/21/2018"
"Wonderful stay! I alerted the hotel that I would be proposing to my girlfriend during our stay, and Jonathan upgraded us to a suite (Room 707) which was INCREDIBLE!!! Without question the most beautiful hotel room I've ever stayed in. The floor to ceiling windows, the panoramic views of the lower Manhattan / the NY bay, and the delicious dinner at the hotel restaurant ""The Osprey"" all made the experience A+. Special thanks to Jonathan for his help! Highly recommend!","1/28/2018"
"I had been to this bar a couple of times and I liked it a lot. It has a great view and the pretty pricey drinks are worth it. Today I went with my two german friends who are visiting right now and we ordered a bottle of sparkling Rosé for $58. My friend gave him $70 and he gave us change which we didn't pay attention to at the time, left a tip and sat down. Unfortunately only then we realized that he gave us only $7 instead of $12 change. I went back to the bar and asked. He was kind of put off and said it was tax. He pretended (how I saw it) to look it up at the register and said, that it came out to $63 after tax. I never paid tax on top of a drink at a bar, and I'm not really a confrontational person, so I left it alone with the feeling of having been ripped off. I really think he thought he could take advantage of us because we were tourists.... and he was right. I don't think I'll go back there anytime soon.","11/2/2017"
"Hotel is beautiful and the management team is amazing. You cannot beat this view of the city either.","10/5/2017"
"I booked 2 rooms last minute at about $500 each for 2 nights. The service was good and the rooms were very nice and had a lot of nice features like a filtered water system and designer lighting. I wanted to plug my MacBook to the tv and the front desk had a HDMI cable that they delivered so I thought that was very nice. The rooftop is great and has views of the Brooklyn bridge and the city. It was my first time staying in Brooklyn as I always choose to stay in the city but I heard a lot of good things about this hotel and the design is beautiful. The reason for my 2 stars is due because after spending the $2000 plus tax and resort fees and another $800 in room service and food and drinks at the pool. They charged me an extra $150 per room because I checked out 30 min past the time. I would understand an hour but I just think that's unreasonable and I feel ripped off at this point.","9/28/2017"
"Wow, what a place!  The appointments inside the room were top notch - including luxe marble bathroom, digital lighting controls and a leather couch with a million dollar view of Manhattan and the Statue of Liberty.  This is not your average hotel room but rather a boutique hotel with real thought that went into offering a truly unique experience.  The staff was very helpful and engaging.  We had drinks in the lobby while listening to live music after going out to eat in the neighborhood.  Having Brooklyn Bridge Park literally at your feet was a big highlight.  In my opinion, it's the nicest hotel in Brooklyn and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to friends and family.","3/19/2017"
"This hotel is a real find-- a gem in Brooklyn. Great service--cool/hip, attentive and welcoming staff. The decor is something to see--modern/chic mixed with natural matierals (woods, stones, recycled fibers). Super pretty and calm--nice contrast with the city views out every window.  And definatley a Brooklyn vibe. The rooms are a bit small but cozy and high style--again, all natural woods, stones and even moss!  Beds are VERY comfortable--right amout of firm and soft and the robe--that's always my favorite accoutrement--was made of soft sweatshirt material. Loved it.  Fine fitness center, good cafe for food and coffee and a fun lobby bar.  I'm definately going back!","3/5/2017"
"Construction noise stared at 7am in the morning!!! It lasted one hour and we can finally fall sleep again then get awaken by loud/worse crazy machine sound again at 9:45am!!! I would give 0 star if I can!!! We called and they saying they are doing construction of their spa upstairs!!! And it's mild?! It's crazy loud and drive us crazy!!can't believe a hotel can let guest stay in this way!!!","5/17/2017"
"This hotel was comfortable, stylish and the views are phenomenal. The staff were lovely and the restaurant The Osprey has lovely fare. I high recommend it and will definitely stay there again!","12/20/2017"
"Beautiful space, killer service, and tasty cocktails! We had made a reservation for the rooftop, unfortunately due to weather the hotel/bar had to close the rooftop before we arrived. When we did arrive the staff was very understanding and accommodating and quickly made arrangements for us at great spot in the lobby bar. The space itself is worth a trip, location and views are wonderful. Host and servers are laid back and friendly. Cocktails were delicious too!","11/4/2017"
"Stayed here back in August came back after a long day to a room that smelled like cigarette smoke. Told the front desk and they sent up someone from security but nothing happened. Left for an hour to let it air out then came back to an even stronger smell. Told front desk they said they would switch me rooms after they sent up an engineer to verify the smell. Then they said that there were no rooms in the same configuration (meaning they didn't want to upgrade me) they put me in a sleeper room (meaning I could only sleep for the night and then I would have to change rooms a second time the next day) I thought they would have offered something anything to say sorry for the trouble but all I got was a sorry. Mind you this was at midnight. You're in the hospitality industry please don't do this to the next person 1hotel. I will say the rooftop is great but they close early and the hotel is earth-friendly.","9/3/2018"
"Beautiful rooftop.  Some of the most entitled, slow, aloof service I've seen in New York anywhere.  Management here needs to run a much tighter ship.  Food is slow.  Manager on rooftop is condescending and disengaged.   Food comes out cold.  Drinks are far too slow as bartenders are in la-la land.  Day we were there the waiter on rooftop was busy waiting on table of his friends and ignoring many of the other tables.  Overall unacceptable.  We have been regulars at 1 Miami and this has a long way to go yet....","8/27/2017"
"Super nice staff and beautiful hotel. Everyone in the coffee shop is super nice and the smoothies are bomb!","4/10/2017"
"This hotel has pretty views and nice rooms, but the staff they have to ""guard"" the elevators and bar area are rude as heck. We didn't pay $800/ night to get treated like we are trespassing. One thing they have going for them - the rooftop bar - isn't even enjoyable as they let non-guests use it all hours and is so over-packed you can't even stand, let alone get a drink. The Osprey, their restaurant, was a joke. We ordered 5 different drinks and 3 different entrees and they were awful.. not sure these people know what salt or seasoning is. (How do you screw up a steak and Bloody Mary?!) Then had to wait an hour just to pay for the awful stuff. And on the rooms, the shower/toilet is not separate from the room, so make sure you share a room with someone you're comfortable with seeing you shower and poop. I feel like this would be a great hotel if the little details didn't add up to a mediocre experience.","7/3/2018"
"Recently visited the Rooftop Bar & had an awful experience.  While the views were spectacular and the hotel itself is something to see, I wouldn't go back.  My husband and I were treated so poorly by several inexperienced employees.  It seems they are trying to create a club atmosphere.  Please keep in mind it was 4:45 p.m.  We began our journey to the rooftop but not before our hands were stamped by security.  We were then escorted up by another security man to the rooftop where we were greeted immediately by the third security man.  Upon walking onto rooftop we we were told there was seating around the corner.  We proceeded to corner and were greeted by several young staff who seemed reluctant to accommodate us, to say the least.  The head person asked, ""How long are you going to be?"" I was a little stunned but told him we just want to a cocktail and maybe small snack.  He turned and consulted with two other staff people.  I then said to him, we are not staying for all the hoopla and then said he would sit us.  He then asked to have a credit card before we sat, along with signature!  I reluctantly agreed and he then pointed to his side, a foot from his host check in desk, for us to sit on the childlike chairs that were practically underneath him and his staff.  My husband and I asked for something else & he then instructed hostess.  As we began to follow hostess she lead us to the very back of rooftop by the pool, while passing many empty little tables.  By the way, the ONLY other table that was occupied was a table with two people on it!  I told the hostess I didn't want to sit at the back looking at cement wall and if she could please sit us by small table we just passed.  She told us she had to ask up front, so we waited few minutes.  She came back and asked us, again, ""How long are you going to be?""  Again, I told her, we were planning on having one drink each and a snack only!  All this while the entire place was EMPTY!  If that wasn't bad enough, immediately after we sat, another couple came in and I watched them get treated the same way.  The waitress tried seating them on this pouf like thing and he refused, asking to sit at a table but the same ritual ensued.  she went back and forth to host desk several times.  I heard him ask for manager & they left him there for several minutes just standing looking around at all these empty tables.  After several conversations with staff the couple walked out.  My husband and I were exiting at the same time and we talked with them on the elevator ride.  The couple were from Ireland and were guest of 1Hotel Brooklyn Bridge.  He was appalled by the way he was treated!  He said throughout his entire visit to New York he had never been treated so poorly!  I told them what had taken place with us and he shook his head in disbelief!!  Shame on you 1 Hotel Brooklyn Bridge Rooftop!  Get some management with COMMON SENSE!","7/1/2017"
