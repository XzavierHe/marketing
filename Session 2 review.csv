"ample protection with good looks","Accurate dimensions, thick bumper, and compliments 13 pro sierra blue iPhone.  The raised back prevents the back camera from getting easily scratched but I think that they could have been raised a little more. The bumper around the phone is thick but not bulky it and it does not render the buttons to be useless. MagSafe works. It is new so no problems so for but we’ll see in the next few months because clear cases do tend to turn yellow especially in the summer months.","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"Best phone case I’ve ever purchased!","Super sturdy, tight fit, not big and bulky. Sleek and slim design with all the protection you need to protect your iPhone. It was initially hard to get my phone in the case so much so that I thought I had ordered the wrong size, but it does fit once you pop it in there. I had to replace my old similar case (target brand) because it had started falling apart in a matter of a few months. Worth the money! This case is built to last!","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"Works fine but anchor magnet fell out","I love the clear basic case. It’s a hard plastic back and flexible bumper. Keeps my phone protected from falls and scratches. Only complaints are that the soft plastic always yellows and the little anchor magnet fell out when I took the case off. Honestly looks a little rough for only using it for 6 months but it’s cheaper than the apple case and probably provides better protection.","4.0 out of 5 stars"
"Love this case","I love how slim it is and so far no yellowing like the cheap ones. I have had it for a couple of months and drop my phone almost daily with no problems. No dints or dings. I love it.","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"nice grippy slim case","excellent grippy silicon rails , relatively easy to slip onto & off  iphone 13 pro; excellent cutout for the camera lenses (fwiw the QHOHQ lense cover fit perfectly into the cutout); excellent buy at 40% off list","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"nigge dose aprove","good case","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"Hands down best case you can get","The apple created case is way to slippery and causes you to slip and crack your screen. This otter box one looks clean like the apple one but is more sturdy and easier to handle. May I also add that this is actually cheaper as well","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"Ordered 13pro for a regular 13 by mistake","Accidentally ordered a 13 pro for a 13. It’s did not fit over the camera lens.  The hole was too small near the corner .","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"Activate and Set up a new phone before putting on this case","I made the mistake of putting the case on after charging but before activating and setting up the iPhone13 Pro.  BIG MISTAKE.  Starting with the phone off, by the time the box was on, the phone had turned on and set to Italian making it impossible for me to activate the phone.  Turning off and on using the case is difficult and awkward, the phone buttons are difficult to press (other then when putting the case on).","4.0 out of 5 stars"
"Very nice and very protective of my phone.","Very nice and very protective of my phone.","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"Love it","Otter box for life! I’ve always been an otter box person. But I tried to use another brand clear case I got at the phone store but I couldn’t use the mag charger with it and it kept slipping out of my hands. This one has good grippy sides, and I can charge it with out taking the case off.","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"Life saver","Just dropped my new IPhone 13Pro down a flight of stairs. Held my breath and can say with 100 certainty this case works well. Not a scratch and phone is in perfect working order. I guess that’s to be expected but you never know these days. So the case looks great and works very well.","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"Pretty good case","Just got the case. it's very grippy and soft on the front and sides. The back is a bit slick. I like it so far. I hope it doesn't yellow","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"Case doesn't take away from the iPhones looks","This is a great case by Otterbox. I love that it doesn't take away from the look of the iPhone.  I had a solid case on my 13 pro for a while but didn't like that it took away from the look and color of the phone. This case is very easy to hold and does a great job of protecting the phone.","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"Discoloration","Great case! However I’ve only had it 2 months and its starting to discolor.","4.0 out of 5 stars"
"Great but turns yellow","I love otterbox. They are the only case I put on my iphones. They are sturdy and last a long time. This one is no exception, except that the edges start to turn yellow after about a month and that it scratches easily. That is the only reason for the 3 star review.","3.0 out of 5 stars"
"Nothing wrong with the product, except that it’s used and I paid for a brand new product","Obviously, the package had been opened and taped closed. The case itself has small scratches and had fingerprints all over it. Couldn’t capture that on a photo because it’s clear. I paid full Price for a new item, not a used and returned one.","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"Fits Perfect","Great quality, fits perfect and looks great!","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"Not worth the money","It’s just been 6 months the rubber portion of case is coming off and doesn’t sit and puts a risk to the phone. Not worth for the money. It’s very disappointing to get from Otter.","2.0 out of 5 stars"
"Love the recyclable packaging","i love the recyclable packaging because you already know what it looks like from the picture amazon provides. no need for the plastic packaging.","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"Good overall, yellows quickly.","Clear case yellows quickly. Great product for overall protection.","3.0 out of 5 stars"
"Not the quality or value of the traditional Otterbox case","I’d heard positive remarks by friends and family who purchased otterbox cases for their iPhones. That must have been true for their prior cases. Today, however, their cases look, feel, and seem “cheaply” made. This case should cost no more than $5 retail. It’s definitely not made for much protection at all.","3.0 out of 5 stars"
"Elegant protection.","Love this clear case it fits my phone perfect and has not turned yellow and minimal scratches so far.","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"Not as sturdy as they say","The case began yellowing after 3 months and the bottom of the case started peeling after 6 months. I am disappointed because I thought it would last at least a year, especially given the price.","2.0 out of 5 stars"
"Easy to install for max protection","It is much better than the Plastic 0ne I had on my previous phone.  It seems to be more responsive to the touch screen.  The protector for the camera lens is very good.  Everything was easy to install.  Everything you need is included, and the internet instructions are easy to follow.","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"Not real otterbox","It does not fit iPhone 13 properly and broke in 2 months","3.0 out of 5 stars"
"Doesn’t seem authentic","Says otterBox but the material looks very cheap. Packaging looks fishy at best. Probably a knock off. Still not that bad of a case if you don’t mind the bad paint job of the MagSafe charging on the back.","2.0 out of 5 stars"
"Bulky but protective","It’s very productive but was really bulky for me to hold. I ended up returning. I would recommend if you get a pop socket or ring holder. Or if you have large man hands. My tiny hands struggled and I didn’t like it.","3.0 out of 5 stars"
"Works with MagSafe Apple Wallet","I was worried the magnet wouldn't be strong enough after some reviews I read but I think it's a stronger hold now with this case. Also used with QHOHQ screen and camera lens protectors and the fit is perfect!","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"Great case","This is a really good case for the money","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"Front of it discolored/darkened after a few months","The back stayed clear. Generally I liked this over the others I reviewed because of grip and durability but there's something in the manufacturing that caused the front half of the unit to discolor dark.","2.0 out of 5 stars"
"Their warranty is garbage.","Very dissatisfied.  $50 case and falling apart after 5 months.  Also,  you have to pay for a warranty replacement.  Do not recommend.","2.0 out of 5 stars"

"Low quality for a premium price, went from clear to YELLOW in less than 2 months","he case started yellowing in less than 2 months, not what I was expecting from Otterbox, especially at the premium price that otter box charges. Very disappointed in the product and im not entirely sure ill be buying an otter box again.","2.0 out of 5 stars"
"the soft parts yellow and it falls apart","Considering that this is an OtterBox product I was expecting much better quality. Turns out it’s no better than something you would’ve gotten for $10 don’t waste your money","2.0 out of 5 stars"
"Love it !!","Love the case …","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"Don’t waste your money","The thing doesn’t look nearly as neat and clean as it does advertised. The case would probably look a lot better without the stupid symbol in the middle of it. Honestly, probably will just toss it and buy a one sooner than later. Had it a week and it’s already full of dirt. I bought it only because my iPhone 8 had an otter box on it for 6 years (20 dollar case) and never got a scratch but obviously otter box has fallen to the profit over quality ideology.","2.0 out of 5 stars"
"Not impressed","After 5 months, half of the clear case is discolored/yellow.","2.0 out of 5 stars"

"tired of trying to clean it","i've tried rubbing alcohol and dish soap several times and can't get the yellow out of the sides here.","2.0 out of 5 stars"
"Breaks easy","The cover for the camera part shattered it appears to be a weakness in the design.  It sticks out farther than the rest of the case so it takes the hit.  You once that’s broke. The whole case is worthless if you want to take photos you’ll have to take bad ones.  I’ve owned many otter box products this is the first that broke like this.  I wouldn’t buy this model again.","1.0 out of 5 stars"
"Magnet does not work","This case is very expensive due to the MagSafe capabilities and they do not work. The magnet is extremely weak and not worth using because your phone will fall. The case itself is fine but I am returning it to get just a standard otter box. Don’t spend the extra for MagSafe.","2.0 out of 5 stars"
"Great","100% would buy again","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"Moderate case. Better less expensive options elsewhere","The case yellowed in about a month. Worked well to protect my phone but isn’t as good as other otter box products I’ve used.","2.0 out of 5 stars"
"Fall from less than 6 foot cracked screen protector","This case does not have a high enough lip around the front to protect iPhone 13 pro’s screen. The polycarbonate back shows fingerprints. It is a very tight fitting case, which is good. The TPU on the sides is slightly grippy. At this price there is a much much better option available.","2.0 out of 5 stars"
"Case has yellowed and fogged and has a crack in the corner","","2.0 out of 5 stars"
"Back glass shattered less than a week after I put it on","I previously had a clear symmetry case on my iPhone 13 Pro. It had become discolored so I bought a new one for my phone to take on a cruise. Less than a week after I put it on my phone fell out of my hand onto the deck and the back glass shattered while still inside the case.  Ridiculous given what I paid for the case - I have had many iPhones and cases over the years and have never had this happen.","1.0 out of 5 stars"
"Magnet does not work","Magnet didn’t work at all - pop thingy popped right off , I almost threw my new phone on the ground. Returning It","2.0 out of 5 stars"

"It doesn’t fit in iPhone 14 pro! Don’t buy it!!!","The open space for the lenses doesn’t fit properly. That leads to the case not to fit in the phone properly!!!","1.0 out of 5 stars"
"discolored (yellowish) after a four months. Avoid.","discolored (yellowish) after four months.  Otterbox charges $9.99 to submit a warranty claim to replace. Avoid this product.","1.0 out of 5 stars"
"Very Disappointed","Ordered this after reading and watching You Tube reviews. Very Disappointed! Arrived quickly! Package was sealed along with product box. Case was not wrapped in anything inside box! Took out and immediately noticed Huge scratch on back of case! Put back in box and returned! No more Clear Cases from Otterbox!","1.0 out of 5 stars"
"Not worth the extra 20 dollars for the magnet","Magnet is ugly and can't hold the weight if the phone.","2.0 out of 5 stars"
"Turning Yellow After 4 Months","The front of the case is turning yellow. It's a different material than the back of the case. It's just now 4 months old. Also, the plastic part that covers the camera cracked...not sure when that happened but. That is not necessarily a bad review just pointing that out.","1.0 out of 5 stars"
"Clear case yellows quickly","I can't recommend this case because the clear plastic yellows quickly (3-6 months with light use). Disappointing given the premium price point.","1.0 out of 5 stars"
"I ordered 2 and one had a different size window for the cameras!","Both boxes were the same and both said they were for the iPhone 13 Pro but one of them looked like THIS! Both fit around the phone but only one didn't block the cameras! Returning at least one of them!","1.0 out of 5 stars"
"Apple cases are just flashy and expensive","The case is flashy and expensive. There’s a big exposed gap in the bottom portion of the case that doesn’t protect the phone. The material feels cheap and fragile. It’s not a snug fit, tons of lint squeeze in the borders. You’re better off buying a symmetry + otter box case. It has MagSafe on it and it protects the whole phone.","1.0 out of 5 stars"
"Broken Case and late shipment","The product is garbage, the whole power button is missing, my shipping was late and despite that my product was damaged, it doesn’t even come with wipes or something, complete waste of money, I bought it on sale, still not worth the $40","1.0 out of 5 stars"
"Yellows after 1 month.","Product is not worth the price. The case turned yellow after a month","1.0 out of 5 stars"
"Yellowing","I’ve had this case for just over a month and just noticed it’s turning yellow. So disappointing!","1.0 out of 5 stars"
"A Game Changer","I switched from an Apple MagSafe to this Otter MagSafe. Quite happy with this case it actually does what it states. Apple cases are very difficult to hold, zero grip and unfortunately resulted in too may drops. This Otter case is fab. Slimmer and functional I highly recommend!","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"Disappointing","For the name of the brand and the price, this case really should wear better. I got the clear case not quite a year ago but some parts started to yellow in about 4-6 months; and they look gross now. Also, this is the second Otterbox case that hasn’t been rigid enough around the volume and silence button and different material parts have separated and become floppy. This is the second time I’ve experienced sturdiness issues, so I’ll be trying another brand.","2.0 out of 5 stars"
"Looks great","Works great on my IPhone 13Pro. Protects it pretty well and the Magsafe is good and strong","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"Excellent product","Fits my iPhone 13 pro perfectly Great feel with non slip sides Works great with my wireless charger Highly recommend this product","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"Fits Like A Glove","Just added to the phone and it fits like a glove. I think the bad reviews are from ones who may have received a bad case or had a bad experience. I love it so far. It is kinda heavy.","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"Great Case","I like the sturdiness and the clear color is nice so you can enjoy the color of your iPhone.","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"Works perfectly","Great case at a great price. Would recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"The best case ever","I always buy Otterbox for my phones. Easy to got on my iPhone 13. Great grip. I’ve already dropped my phone twice and the protection is unbeatable.","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"Incredible iPhone case","This case is extremely well made…it’s worth the money. It’s slim in the hand with just enough grip without being too grippy. It fits my iPhone 13 Pro perfectly and the wireless Mag charging is very convenient. The easiest way for me to install this case is to lay the phone flat on its face on a hand towel. Starting at one end press the phone case gently onto the phone. Once it’s almost snapped turn it over and finish popping the edges in. Very easy to install this way. I recommend this case to anyone for their iPhone 13 Pro. Cheers!","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"I loved it until the lens cover fell off.","This case comes in two pieces- the usual case that fits snugly around your phone and a separate piece that adheres over the camera lenses. This piece lasted 4 months until it no longer stayed in place. For what I paid, I expected better performance.","2.0 out of 5 stars"
"Way better than Apple clear case.","Love the fit and the way it allows your phone color to be seen. I liked mine so much, bought them for the whole family and they ALL love theirs as well!!!  Love the Mag safe too.","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"Very protective and practical","Very protective, and love that it’s MagSafe compatible. It does turn brown on the plastic sides, but that personally doesn’t bother me.","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"Case with fit issues!","As few of the reviews states it’s not a sturdy or perfect fit for iPhone 13 pro and which is true. The case is well built for best protection but the fit is not good. Phone pops out many times from bottom when placed in pocket and in random use. This case falls in to expensive category so it’s not worth a buy because of the fit issue. Even the MagSafe magnet are not that strong compared to some less expensive cases. All I can do now is return.","2.0 out of 5 stars"
"Works great fit well","Husband loves this , it's durable and worth the cost!","5.0 out of 5 stars"
