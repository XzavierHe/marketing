"The Segway ES1L Escooter is my 2nd escooter, as I've previously purchased the HiBoy SL2 Pro, which I still have.  The two escooters are in different classes, as the Segway is more of an entry level. After reading many reviews on the Segway ES1L, I knew what to expect before I purchased it.  Still, I found myself wishing more was included with the escooter.  But having paid $299 for the ES1L, I am comfortable for what I got for the money.  Still, it would have been nice to have something as basic as a bell on the escooter. Pros: Design - This scooter was introduced a few years ago, but the design I feel is still modern, and even better the newer escooters costing much more. Weight - One of the reasons I purchased this escooter was I was looking for something easier to carry around than my HiBoy SL2 Pro.  And at about 25 pounds, the Segway ES1L is much lighter, and more comfortable to carry. Suspension - I was pleasantly surprised by how soft the ride was over small bumps, as the tires are not air-filled, and are relatively small.  There is a cheap sounding ""clunking"" noise that's made when the ES1L goes over some bumps...and it can get bouncy.  But it's not a harsh ride, and I prefer it over the HiBoy, even though the HiBoy has bigger 10 inch tires, and cost $215 more. Folding - One of the easier escooters to fold.  Simply step on the latch in the front, and the scooter folds.  You can hook the top half to the rear fender, making the scooter very easy to carry.  To open the scooter back up, just reverse those steps. Braking - The electronic brake felt pretty strong, and is easy to use. Cons: Speed - I knew before purchasing the escooter, the speed was limited to 12.4 mph (20 kph).  But still, I find myself wishing it was made to reach 15-16 mph.  My HiBoy goes 19-20mph. Range - Probably the most disappointing part of the escooter is the pitiful range.  For a scooter that only goes 12-13 mph, it would have been nice to be able to get more than the 12.4 miles per battery charge.  Real life range is most likely 7-9 miles. Safety features - Missing a tail lamp, and a bell is disappointing.  I understand wanting to keep costs down, but these two features would make riding more safe, and should not have been left out.  I mean, how much would it have added a bell...something tricycles come with? Neutral: Fun to ride - The ES1L is fun to ride, but the lack of speed makes it less enjoyable.  There is no cruise control, which would have made the ride, greater. Who is this scooter for? The Segway ES1L is perfect for those just starting out with electronic scooters, as it's not powerful, easy to carry, and easy to ride.  The ES1L is also perfect for someone looking for an escooter for short commutes. Who would not want this scooter? If you are looking for an escooter with fast speed and/or great mileage, look elsewhere.  This is a basic escooter, and is priced that way.  If you are looking for an escooter to ride on busy, or active city streets, I would pass on this, as it will not be able to keep up with traffic.  An exception would be if you live in a town with bike lanes, or if you are okay with not being able to keep up with traffic when riding your scooter. If there was an option to give 3.5 stars, I would have do so.  But because of the $299 price, as well as the other parts of this scooter I like, I give the Segway ES1L, 4 stars.  If this scooter was $350, or more, I would have given it 3 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on August 9, 2022"
"Hi, my name is Wytemi, Sheralyn's 25 year-old son. I will be reviewing this product. I highly recommend reading this in-depth review BEFORE considering buying this product. I have had the opportunity to really push the scooter to the limit the past 2 weeks. I am sad to say that this product boasts a misleading advertisement. I've separated my review into 7 categories and a final verdict at the bottom. SPEED : I am displeased that this bike can only go 12 miles per hour on flat land. If you are going down a hill, you can only cruise down at about 14 miles per hour. This is considered on the slow end of what most other E-Scooters offer; 15-20 is considered average across the market of E-Scooters. On an incline, this E-Scooter states in the advertising that it can handle a 7% incline. This is fine, but considering most places you will be going is at least sitting at a 10-15% incline. When riding the E-Scooter at any percent higher than 7%, the E-Scooter slows to a crawling 7 mph. Considering my standard walking distance is usually 4 mph, this was like the speed of a hoverboard, which defeats the purpose MOVEMENT: This bike has little to no inertia. If I were on any other scooter or bike and going down a hill, I could easily clock 20 MPH, but this bike isn't even capable of hitting 16 mph at any circumstance, even if you have the pedal pressed down (which is required to even hit speeds of 16 mph on a downward decline). If the battery were to die; which I did check, the bike because a slog to travel on. Its like the wheels have some resistance working against it unless the electric pedal is in use. BATTERY & DISTANCE: The battery dies FAST. The E-Scooter has a simple 5 bar battery display. Each bar represents 20% of battery, and a flashing bar represents 10% battery. On a usual cruise through the park I can watch the battery drop and its the most concerning thing about this E-Scooter. A normally 15 minute walk to my campus on less than 4% incline or so will take my battery down from 100% to around 70% in 15 minutes. I decided to put the E-Scooter to the biggest test. My sister lives about a 20 minute walk away from me, and the trip is a steady 10% all the way up. The E-Scooter was able to make the trip, at the cost of 40% of the battery in only 15 minutes. On the way back home, while it was a steady downward 10% incline, It still consumed an additional 16% to get home in 15 minutes. By the time I plugged the E-Scooter back in to the power supply, the battery was at 33%. The battery lost 66% in only 30 minutes. This bike advertises a max distance of 12 MPH, but in my tests and regular uses, this E-Scooter hasn't been capable of even hitting 5 mph. WEIGHT: At almost 25 lbs., this E-Scooter is very heavy and is a chore to take up even a short flight of stairs. I do appreciate and commend the option of folding the E-Scooter, however even with the folding mechanism, I find myself just breaking courtesy rules and cruising inside buildings as it is just so heavy to carry around. The weight limit on this E-Scooter is only 220 lbs. at maximum; I weigh about 190 on average. Anyone heavier, even by a pound, will make the E-Scooter crawl. To you romantics out there, I don't suggest taking a Significant Other as a ride partner on these. You would be better off renting a public scooter. PHYSICAL FEATURES: The folding mechanism, which is nice that this heavy E-Scooter offers, is still not enough to give benefit of the doubt. The folding mechanism is cheap and only held by a cheap piece of plastic, and I've noticed it comes unlatched on its own just by carrying it. Standing it up in a corner is a pain as there is no wheel locking mechanism. However, the latch mechanism which helps hold the E-Scooter up while in transit is very sturdy. You need not worry about the bike folding down on you in the middle of a ride. I will say that the wheels are surprising durable in comparison to the rest of the E-Scooter. While I have not tested it on ice in the winter, it performs very well in rain, over puddles, and over large cracks. The E-Scooter does very well in this field. The handles are made of a cheap foam that can tear easily. The brake and electric gas pedal are made of cheap plastic. The front Brake pedal is not a proper brake, but an electric brake. It will slow the E-Scooter down, but it fails miserable in terms of an emergency full stop. I have almost run into several stopped cars or pedestrians because I forget that's not what this pedal is for. The real emergency brake is at the rear wheel behind you, however it requires you to put all your weight on it to get a proper emergency stop. DIGITAL U.I.: The UI is disappointing. The display I received is is KMPH and not in MPH. The UI does have a proper number battery percentage, but it only shows when plugged in. I do not thing bars are a good representation of battery; this is a fad that should have died in the early 2000's. The flashlight icon is activated by pressing the power button once lightly, which is confusing and contradicting. There should have been a dedicated flashlight button. I will say the flashlight works quite well ay night and is quite bright. This E-Scooter could have benefited from a smartphone app connection to change settings, but the UI provided is permanent. So I will sadly be stuck reading and calculating KMPH to MPH when riding. PRICE: On the official Segway Ninebot website, the ES1L is priced at $379.99. Here on Amazon, which is where I bought it, is marked down at only $299.99. This price drop is welcoming considering all the downsides this E-Scooter has against it. While I have so many opinions against this E-Scooter, it is hard to not justify it's price tag of almost $300; not including shipping. When every other E-Scooter on the market with all these issues resolved on them, they are charged between $650 to $900. So the cheap price does make the lackluster features of this E-Scooter understandable. VERDICT: PROS: The price alone makes this a decent purchase if someone is looking for an E-Scooter for very short term commuting. While it's a pain, It does barely fit my needs and I can get where I need around my college town. The wheels are surprising durable and will not break down if you live in an area with tattered asphalt or harsh terrain. The flashlight is quite bright and you need not worry about being missed in the dark by an incoming car or late night runner. CONS: Everything else.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on October 7, 2021"
"Wow - we love these... ordered one... then two... now our third - and all are still running well! Friends and family love taking turns with these! Like that they are green-energy, light enough to carry, that they have solid tires, and are definitely easier to hop on and off of than an E-bike. Break gives more control than a regular bike break, too. Feels much safer in shared bike/walking areas, if permitted there.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on January 7, 2023"
"This is a nifty scooter. I used to pay to rent one in my town but it was so expensive for one use. This definitely is money better spent to own rather than rent. It’s sleek, not too heavy, folds, and charges easily.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on January 16, 2023"
"Bought this rather on a whim, with an underlying legitimate reason. I was spending $40-$50 a week on Ubers just to get to work. With Amazon payments, 5 months of $60 seemed a lot cheaper. I've only had it a few days, but it's already gotten me to and from work, to the vape shop, and even a late night snack excursion. I have a blast on it, and was surprised how easy I took to it. I was more of a bicycle kid growing up, so scooting around at 50 was rather easy. Only cons would be range not really as advertised, and it really sucks on hills. That's not really an issue for me, as I can't vape and scoot, so little walking bits are fine. Bottom line for me: it's better than walking, fun and really easy to learn!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on November 21, 2022"
"My teenagers got these for Christmas and they love it. It is well made, the batter appears to last a long while and the light is a beast. They'd like to go faster but for what they need it's perfect. Definitely recommend","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on December 27, 2022"
"Got this for my son for Christmas. He loves it. It’s built with quality, great on battery life. It has 3 modes. Standard speed, second speed, and 3rd speed which is the fastest at 12.5 mph. Assembly was also fast and easy. Literally plug in handle bars to the battery deck and tighten the screw with the tool provided.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on December 27, 2022"
"I've been using this for about 10 miles and looks like the battery lasts 15% for every mile.  The hardware is pretty sturdy; I hit a few potholes by mistake and it is fine. No easy way to lock it.  It feels like it is faster than 12mph max speed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on December 19, 2022"

"The scooter rating will be split up to 3 categories pro's and con's and middle Pro's 1. Its very comfortable and it has nice suspension 2. It's front light is very bright and there's a brake light that blinks every time you reverse. 3. The scooter isn't as very loud and it doesn't make any sound. 4. Its standing pad is very large Middle's, 1. The speed is average 2. It's price for it is expensive but not to expensive Con's 1. It's battery life isn't as long as another scooter I had which I had that lasted for almost 4 hours 2. Its a lot slower then other scooters 3. It's pretty heavy for an average electric scooter 4. The braking is ABSOLUETELY HORRIBLE, the breaking takes around 5 seconds for the scooter going at full speed to completely stop, and the braking doesn't even work when its not moving so I can't keep it in place, rather than an electric brake I would recommend a regular bike brake where you can control the amount of force and you can brake the scooter so it doesn't roll down a hill Other then that I don't really recommend this scooter since there can and will be better, faster, scooters for less or more, its just the fact that Ninebot is a pretty famous electric scooter brand but yet they use most of there funds on an electric break that barely works.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2022"
"Very high-quality scooter and great bang for the buck compared to much higher-priced options. My son uses it everywhere at his huge University campus. The only downside is that it cannot get up hills on its own. You do need to kick through the hill, but the battery assist helps a lot so it's not that big of a deal. If you want a scooter that can crush hills, you'll need to get a higher-priced, more powerful scooter.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2022"
"easy assembly. delivered unconcealed in the original box (a bad thing). another review was mentioning the scooter shaking and making a weird noise with a video: https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3SUW79TLYIMLS/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08GKP7YXL I had the same problem a couple of times, turning it off and back on usually solved it. it didn't make it unusable but was a little scary and not supposed to happen. process for switching between modes is kind of annoying. overall, I am happy with the purchase and I use this scooter almost every day to commute and just for fun. i bought this when it was priced at $299","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on October 12, 2022"
"We got three of these as family Christmas presents in December 2021. Overall we have been happy with them. We've gone on several family rides of varying distances, including some 6+ miles, and batteries have never been a limiting factor. I presume if someone hopes to use these as a daily commuter, depending on how far away they need to commute and whether charging is available at work, this would work great. The headlight is a nice feature, and is bright enough to illuminate the road at dawn or dusk, and improve the rider's visibility to oncoming vehicles, but probably not quite sufficient for night-time riding. We also like the electric breaks, plus the mechanical rear break as a fail-safe. Five months in, we have identified two noteworthy drawbacks, worthy of knocking off 1-2 stars from the rating (hence my 4-star rating): 1. All three scooters' kickstands have broken off. This may be because the kids ride them and aren't the most careful when defending curbs, etc., but the fact is, the kickstand does stick out even when it's up. So if you aren't super careful about bumps, curbs, etc., you can expect to bottom-out against the kickstand, and the kickstand will break off. 2. Speed. These top-out at about 20 kmh. That probably seems fast as you read this while sitting on your couch, but that's just over 12mph and trust me, when riding, it really feels like these should be able to go a little faster. 20-25 mph is probably more ideal for commuting on roads, and it would also be significantly more fun! My six-year-old daughter outpaces one of these scooters on her bicycle.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on May 2, 2022"
"In short, this scooter is really for traveling 1 mile or less. Also good for people who want to try E-scooters without dropping $800 on a fully loaded out scooter. It is not great for city commuting, and the build quality is not that great. It is easy to learn to ride if you have just flat, smooth ground with no potholes. I used it to commute 2 miles and it was too slow (10-12mph tops) and struggles uphill (200LBs rider). After 2 months of use, the plastic latch on the rear fender that holds the scooter folded broke. We contacted the Segway and after many emails the solution was for them to send us a part to replace if we pay the shipping. I looked up how to actually do the repair and it was very involved, so we made up a solution (a strap) to hold the scooter folded. It ended up costing less than the shipping for the replacement part. Range is about 4 miles-8 miles depending on rider weight while riding on sport mode. You can probably stretch it to 10 if you ride on eco mode (8mph, which is barely jogging). The wheels are very unforgiving in terms of going over potholes. Even after months of riding, I almost wiped out twice while riding this scooter going over a pothole.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2022"

"I have had this scooter for a year and commute with it during spring, summer and fall (excluding dec-feb). After 1 year of daily usage (8 miles total) and being in a trunk during some hot days, it works just as good as the day I got it. The battery life is excellent and reliable, as are the motor and breaks. This scooter is lighter* weight.  I use it for the ""third leg"" of my commute to get from my car to my work, which is a few miles. I especially like that it folds for easy storage. The folding option allows me to store it in my trunk quickly and out of sight for later errands. I am also able to store it out of the way at work and conveniently charge it. It allows me to park farther away for free and save a considerable amount of money on parking while having a commute that takes just as long as trying to navigate a busy parking deck. Not to mention it is quite a blast and I don't show up all sweaty on hot days or worry about walking alone at night. I like that it has two breaking options and different acceleration speeds. It handles hills pretty well but I wouldn't think it would do well on very steep hills  (see incline restrictions). For the larger hills I go on, I will sometimes give it a push to get more momentum. It is smooth and handles well, unlike the scooters you pay for which feel a bit jerky and sudden in their acceleration. Overall, I highly recommend this scooter for someone who wants a faster mode of transportation and an alternative method to a bike or for kids!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on July 17, 2022"
"The description is very accurate, so I need to give 5 stars. That being said, this thing is so boring to ride, 12.4 mph is so slow compared to even a heavy mountain bike. (Also this version is not compatible with the external battery) Fastest mode will get you 12.4 mph and 7 miles range, next fastest mode will give you 8 miles or so at 12.4 mph with slow acceleration, and the mind numbing 16kmph~9mph mode is the one which gives you a range of 12.4 miles, you won’t get that range unless you are riding the lowest setting.  (Which is in the product description) I’d say this is more for a child to commute to the bus stop, and lock up, rather than a legitimate commuter scooter for adults.  Which as far as I can tell, they don’t claim to be. Speed:  leaves something to be desired Battery life: leaves something to be desired Shock absorbing: leaves something to be desired Charging time: 6 hours for dead battery.  I’d say that’s fine.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on September 12, 2022"
"This scooter is great, and a somewhat affordable option if you don't want to go all out or don't have the funds to. I use it to commute as a college student to campus and back. I am also over the 220 weight limit and it is still fast and rides smoothly. My only gripes are that it's pretty heavy and that it doesn't handle inclines well. I haven't had any trouble charging it, the charger is small and looks like a laptop charger so it's not an issue to bring with me in my backpack. Overall, I really recommend this scooter!","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on September 5, 2022"
"Bought specifically for short commutes to and from work (4.5 miles each way) and ease of bringing up 3 flights of stairs to my walk up apartment or up/down subway stairs, and for those two requirements of mine this Segway is best. I have lighter scooters, but they can’t take the pounding of the potholes and atrocious road conditions of Brooklyn, NY (or rather, they pass on every jarring impact on to my bones) as well as this one does. I bought a heavier scooter that could, but at 40 lbs it was too heavy and punishing to transport for my 150 lb 5’2” frame. The ES1L is the perfect compromise. On standard mode a full charge will get me about 9 miles, and a bit less if the weather is cold (i guess the battery uses up more energy to keep itself humming). I have to charge it daily to have enough juice for the day. It does have the sport mode that supposedly can speed you up to 24 kmh but I haven’t used it other than to go up steeper hills on my commute, but even then I find the standard mode sufficient for that. I am not a speedster on roads so I find the 20 kmh speed at standard mode quick enough (the 4.5 mile commute is about 35 minutes). The headlights it came with are just bright enough to alert drivers in front of you about your presence - I bought a separate one to illuminate the road in front of me during night time trips. No rearlights either, so get some good ones to attach to your backpack or helmet. So far in the 3 weeks I’ve been using it, the corner of the sandpaper covering of the platform is starting to lift up but that can easily be remedied. Overall a really great simple, light but sturdy scooter! UPDATE 12/16/2020: Not even a month after purchase and the electric brakes have started to fail. The throttle pushes down but doesn’t pop back up, keeping the stroller in brakes unless you push the brake throttle back up. Soon after contacting Customer Service, it stopped taking a charge. So now I have a dead scooter. Still awaiting a box to send the unit in to be sent by the company - it has now been 2 weeks that I’ve been waiting. Segway’s customer service needs a lot of improvement. Will update again to say how the refurbished unit performs. UPDATE 10/27/2021: Battery is now floundering after a year of regular use. Gets discharged quickly, now only lasts 6 miles per full charge on standard speed mode. Replacing battery is going to cost $250 at a repair shop - and as a new unit is currently going for $299, it’s more sensible to just get a new one altogether. Will buy different brand, as the longevity is not the best on Segways.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on December 12, 2020"
"My mom recommended I buy this to commute around college. The acceleration is a little weird to get used to. It will only accelerate once you're in motion. It wasn't till I got an electric skateboard without that feature that I realized why. If you suddenly accelerate from a standstill you're gonna jerk backwards. I have terrible balance so I haven't actually used the breaks, I just bail. My sister said the back break is better to use than the front break since you may jerk forward if you're moving too fast. You'll get used to it after practicing. Its heavier than I thought. Unless you're already pretty strong, you probably won't be picking this up with one hand. You're better off rolling it if you have to move it. The other reviews were right about the grip tape. My sister and I used it for 30 minutes and it was already bubbling up. I half want to just peel it off and replace it with skateboard tape cuz that's ridiculous. Outside of that, the rest of it seems sturdy so far. I heard the folding lock might break over time but fingers crossed this lasts till graduation. edit: It only does hills on a full charge with a light rider (I'm 150lbs for ref). Even then you gotta get up to speed for it to keep going. When it had half a charge, it struggled and then died at the top of the hill with my 200lb boyfriend on it. It holds the charge for a while though, if you don't ride it. I didn't touch it for a month during Christmas n then rode it in the cold and it still had 2 bars left. edit 2 (11/7/2022): Its been like a year now. I've dropped it twice from going too fast down hill and now something in the pole part rattles. The accelerator sticks a bit and the breaks are wonky. Sometimes they're on when I'm trying to push it around as opposed to when I'm actually using the break on the handle. Its now faster to push it when its off. Apparently you can fix the break issue by replacing the control board but I haven't tried it yet.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on September 11, 2021"
"Scooters work great, my kids love them, we use them almost every day. The battery life is pretty good since my kids are pretty light so the scooters don't struggle much to haul them around. They do very good on steep hills. The only issue that I have is that the charger for one of the scooter stops working so I have to unplug it for a few minutes and then plug it back in for it to work again.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on September 7, 2022"

"Moter break didn't work well for a few times. This is same issue as shown by the video from another reviewer. The unique feature is that it might be the only low price model that has front suspension. I like this feature. I feel a little unsafe when riding at night cus it has no rear led light. You know when cars coming up to you from the back at night, it feels not that good thought you are not in their lane.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on August 17, 2022"
"Out of the box this was a great scooter.  Rides decent, a little slow on the fastest setting taking off and on hills but ok.  We bought for our son and daughters 9, 12, and 12 to go around the neighborhood.  Battery life pretty good, not the best for commuting though. So the bad…my son just came home and it malfunctioned.  It stopped, at a dead stop, while doing about 15 mph.  It flipped him over the handle bar and eat it face first.  He is ok but banged up.  It has a red wrench flashing and throws an 11 code the most.  When plugged in to charge, it beeps and throws tons of numbers around and will not charge.  It will not accelerate at all.  I reached out to Segway today and got 2 responses.  Both stating they would not help with repairs as it is out of its 1 year warranty.  They further told me a certified Segway repair center “should” be up sometime in early 2023 and keep a look out for it.  We are over the 1 year warranty by a month or two and the second person to respond back to me told me again, that they will not repair it as it is company policy.  I even asked if there was anyone near me that could help and zero reply about that.  They also told us the codes mean the main brain box has malfunctioned. So if you want to buy this be aware that there is no service repair when something goes wrong.  In addition, there is obviously a problem with this scooter which will probably cost me around the same price, or more, then we payed for it.  14 months of ownership and only not used for 5-6 months through the winters.  I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!!!  Two of our neighbors have the GoTrax brand.  I would highly recommend buying one of them for a couple dollars more.  They are sturdier, longer battery life, go longer distances, smoother ride, certified service for issues, and faster (top speed) then the Segway.  Segway will never get any of our money again.  We are out a lot of money and now buying from a different company, GoTrax.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on January 17, 2023"
"Pros: -Seemingly well made -easy to use -pretty lightweight even my 107lb Girlfriend can pick up and carry short distances -Light on the front is very well done and shines a perfect pattern -when folded you can wheel it around when holding the handlebars -Air-free tires means no flats to worry about Cons: -Don't be misled by the stated12mile range if you're over 150lbs. Range will really depend on your weight and terrain. -front shock absorber doesn't feel like it does much except make a clunking sound from time to time on bumps -Air Free tires make for a bit of a rough ride in some instances -You can't change the speed indicator out of Kph -at around 35% state of charge I was unable to make it up hills that I was able to get up with a higher state of charge. The motor would shut off and I would have to push+power to get up the hill. Final Thoughts:  I'm still happy with the Scooter purchase, I knew this wasn't for long trips, though I do wish the battery system was a tad stronger/larger.

"This scooter just cut our kids commute time from 40 mins to 10 every morning. And that's from just 2 miles of driving before.  It was easy to ride, stable and strong.  The battery charged from 40% to 90% in 2 hours.  And after several days of scooting, it is still over 70%.  It says 12 mph top speed but we've gone on flat roads at almost 15mph. The best thing about this scooter is how light it is.  So I can scoot with my son and take the scooter back with me for now so he doesn't worry about locking it.  The next best thing, it has a really good folding mechanism.  It folds easy yet is beefy to not worry about it folding while commuting. Shipping was fast.  Scooters were well packed.  I would buy this brand again from the same seller!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on August 22, 2022"
"This is a preliminary review after only 1 day of riding. I am new to scooters and don’t have the knowledge base to effectively compare it to others. I bought this scooter as a practice model to see how I like it while I consider something more expensive. Ride about 4.5 miles today on an outing w my 8yo daughter who rode her razor power core 100. I’m n the upper end of this scooters weight range ( maybe over 220 counting the heavy backpack I took). I was surprised the scooter made it up to 12.5 mi/ hr and sustained that w/out much difficulty. The controls were very intuitive and easy to learn even for a first timer like me. I rode during the day so I haven’t used the light yet. I felt comfortable while riding, though I wish the deck were just slightly bigger ( size 12 shoes).  After around 4 miles of level ground at its max weight limit the power level was down to 45 percent. I’m not sure yet what that says about it’s max range w me on it, but I’m hoping to get 7 miles. Overall I’m very pleased with the scooter. I wish it had a bell and just a bit more range. I’m not sure about the suspension yet as I felt many of the bumps in the road, but I know I’m heavy for it’s design. Also, I’m still figuring out how/ when to shift my weight for a smoother ride going over bumps. That using the scooters fault but rather my own I experience. I plan to do a follow up review after a few months use.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on September 18, 2021"
"I purchased this for my son (about a month or so) so he can commute to and from home/school. He loves it. The distance from home to school is about 1.7 miles and he is able to get there with full battery and by the time he gets off he still has at least 60% left to come back home. I will suggest to NOT use it while is raining. The scooter can die quickly and it can stop working. If you weight more than 200lbs I won’t suggest it either. The heavier you are the faster it will just stop working. I mean if you take good care of it and not just throw it around or use it excessively it can last you for a good while. :) UPDATE as of May 2022: Well the scooter last about 7 months. My son had came from school in the beginning of April with it cracked (front wheel tire was rearranged and it wouldn’t push forward) the scooter promptly alerted that it needed to be fixed. Contact customer services and explained the situation. Even though it took me a month of back and forth emails, they had replaced my son’s scooter with a new one. I received the package at home. They were very helpful and the process was easy to complete. I loved that they provide with shipping label at no cost to you and the FedEx people were really polite. I only paid for the box to ship it into. The shipping to Segway was Free. I am very satisfied with the outcome even if it took a month. If you want to contact Segway I recommend you going directly to their website and EMAIL THEM. Best way to really have a replacement of your scooter or to get it fixed. :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on November 2, 2021"

"OK, so I got this to help with the commute and expenses of a 4th car in the family.  I commute 1 mile to a bus stop ( each way) so it was a no-brainer for me to get a scooter. This one is great on paved roads and with no hills. By no means can this thing get up even the smallest of hills.  It really doesn't do well. It also is NOT friendly to bumps.  I don't care what the reviews say or the listing.  You hit a decent size bump or pothole and it's no good. The hills I go up are not very steep.  I am over the 220 pounds that it claims so I get it.  That could 100% be it. It doesn't get over 19 maybe 20 miles when I go down these hills.  But it's rare.  It typically goes about 14-16.  Nothing crazy.  I am now comparing it to a scooter I rented in LA and that thing is what I want and need.  So I will be returning this.  I will go for something more expensive and better with hills and my size.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on July 12, 2022"

"I was worried about the size and weight of this model for my 7 year old. After a couple of runs up and down the driveway, she handles it well. I didn't want to buy a smaller unit that she'd grow out of in a year. I'd rather she grow into it. Battery life is fantastic! She only weighs about 45lbs. And likes to ride this thing full throttle! I had no idea it was so fast. She can barely see over the handle bars😆. But takes it up to 21 mph! I needed something she could use on bike rides and be able to stay with me.

"I bought two of the scooters for Christmas 2021 and they sat with little use during winter snowy months, then used both scooters for light recreational use for a few months around the neighborhood, no commuting, then one stopped charging, and appears to be dead. I tried swapping chargers and handlebar components from good scooter, with no luck. Segway warranty on batteries is only six months —which time I used up when they were boxed sitting under the tree for Christmas or dormant during snowy months leaving me with essentially two months of actual battery use… and no Segway service centers in my state.  I chatted with the Segway service center located in California, and after reviewing my case they suggested I ship the scooter to them at my cost for them to look at it, I have no idea how much shipping will be but it’s a very heavy item and since I only paid $300 for the scooter new so this is a non-supportable solution. They then recommended there may be some authorized parties in my state that could provide service and gave me a online search map link. After calling all the places across the entire north part of the state, I found out these places stopped working on segway scooters a couple of years ago because of supply chain issues and Segway wouldn’t authorize any level of tinkering, so local places all gave up on being authorized service reps.  If you buy a Segway—you’re on your own unless you live with 25 miles of Los Angeles, CA service center. Hah!","2.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on October 4, 2022"

"I shopped for quite a while to find a good scooter for my school commute, and did quite a bit of research. It seemed to me that the Ninebot Segway line was the most trustworthy and I am very glad I purchased one of their scooters. At the end, I was deciding between this model and the more expensive version with the extra external battery. I am glad I went with this cheaper option, I would have had no extra benefit from the more expensive option. This battery lasts a few miles and has nothing but solid. Very easy to set up out of the box. It has been about 2 months since I got my scooter and it is performing just like new. The different speed modes are nice to use, and the headlight is really bright if I am using it in the dark. One nice feature is that you don't have to pump up any tires or worry about doing any ""maintenance"". I often carry the scooter when folded up, it has some weight to it but is manageable and easy to fold up. Would recommend this scooter to anyone who needs an easy way to get around and doesn't want to break the bank. Reliable, and worth it. So far, this scooter has held up great.

"We bought this scooter mostly because of the Segway name thinking it was coming from a reputable company. Plus we bought the extended warranty just in case. Well we had it for a week before it started making a loud noise from the back tire. We called amazon who connected us with Segway because of the warranty.  We contacted them through email, they responded that they needed pictures and video of the problem and we sent them it immediately.  We didn't hear back from Segway so we contacted them again asking for help. They still didn't' respond so we contacted Amazon because the 30 day return window was closing and we didn't want to get stuck with a scooter with issues. Amazon exchanged the scooter for us after we told them we tried Segway. Four day after we received the new scooter Segway said they are closing our case because we haven't gotten back to them??? I'm really hoping nothing goes wrong with this one because obviously Segway wont do anything about it. It's to bad because I like the scooter but it wont do us any good if it has issues that wont get fixed.

"I had this scooter for 2 weeks and it works great. I have driven it for about 19 miles. I was it get from work to the bus station (1.5 miles) and turns a 27 min walk into 11 min ride on eco. *This is a kick to start scooter* and the front brake alone is good enough to slow down. The ride is rough, I think bigger tires would make for a smoother ride. The speed is good on flat surfaces. I believe each bar of battery is about 2 miles riding in eco mode but this can change if you're riding uphill. It much heavier than I expected and getting it on the bus is awkward. I wish the bottom of the scooter was better protect as it makes contact with the floor and scratches it. Overall I'll recommend this if any beginner.

"Like you, I saw the $299 price and jumped on it.  Unlike you, I didn't research the ES1L at all because, I didn't know I needed to. I knew I wanted the quality of the Ninebot and I wanted it cheaper.  What I didn't know was the ES1L is cheap because it lacks two MAJOR options that made me want it the most.  First, the ES1L does NOT have Bluetooth.  So if you saw all the hacking videos and the cool stuff you can monitor with the Segway app, you're out of luck.  Second, there is no extended battery hookup port on the vertical steering bar like ALL the other models.  I had rightfully assumed there would be as there is nothing that says the ""L"" stood for lacking or loser. Other than those two things, this scooter made me smile and laugh.  I go tearing a** through the neighborhood making all the preteen kids jealous on their non-powered scooters of shame.  My husband and I also like taking it with us to camp sites as it makes it easier to get around.  We weigh ""the exact"" limit of this scooter and get about 8 miles worth of range.  It gets us from the house to Taco Bell (about 4 blocks away) and back with no issues. ::TLDR:: No Bluetooth, no external battery port, and lacking range.  Other than that, it's worth the $299.

"You get what you pay for. The scooter is very nice and ride well for what I need - which is to go grab coffee or travel a couple of blocks to see my friend. I got many complements on it but I do not think it can stand very heavy use. I also have the Ninebot Max that cost double and it would handle much more abuse. ESL1 also does not have as much power so it will go only moderately fast but a little faster that indicated on the box with my weight. Battery is good so far and as I can tell, the same as advertised. The handle is made of plastic type of foam and cushion. I can see that may be one of the first area to go. It is also front heavy. That’s where the motor and all electronic parts are. So you will have to be careful when riding and moving because the leg piece can swing around due to the uneven weight distribution.

Pros: Charges quickly Rides over grass and uneven sidewalk Long battery life Nice easy fold mechanism - the best High weight capacity for adults (my son and I even ride together sometimes) Easy assembly Cons: Heavy Need to make sure you don't accidentally turn on the light when changing speed Wish it had a bell Doesn't stop on a dime (kinda good so you don't fly off) It's super fast in my opinion and I've reached 21 miles per hour. This could be a pro or con depending on your needs. It's fast for a child. I'd read it had 3 speed settings but they all reach 20 miles per hour. The speed settings only affect how fast you take off from a dead stop. The highest speed (red S) takes off so fast as to almost throw me off. Lol! I like the middle setting best for most situations.

"We bought a pair of this for each of our 2 kids. Within a few weeks, my daughter managed to break her kickstand. Upon inspection, there are ears that flank the kickstand itself and they're made out of composite ""metal"", i.e. you could probably break them with your bare hands if you're strong enough but even a light whack with a hammer would break those suckers right off. For over a year, I've been trying to get a replacement kickstand. I thought ""well, the ES1/2/3 all share the same kickstand, I'll try that"" NOPE, not compatible, completely different design. Ninebot has the ES1L kickstand on their website for $99.99. I'm going to repeat that price, $99.99. That is 1/3rd of the price of the scooter! Even if I was crazy enough to spend that kind of money on a kickstand, it's been out of stock for over a year. I would advise against buying this model in particular, maybe an ES1/2/3 where replacement parts are more readily available. I've reached out to their customer support to find out if they'll EVER been in stock again and what the deal is with the price. As of right now, we won't be buying any more Segway or Ninebot products.

I admit that its portability is certainly unparalleled, and its range is pretty good too, it's great to take on the bus or the train, and on a flat college campus you could zoom all over and take it into all your classes, it'd be amazing.

I'd recommend just getting a Hiboy instead, who fit the sweet spots of lightweight and price, upgradable design, range and comfortable riding far better than this disingenuously badly designed scooter. It's usable, but on top of the complaints of bad customer service, shows clearly that Segway is not a trustworthy company.  It'd be like Ferrari selling a slightly cheaper car made to drive poorly and get damaged easily to make you buy the real Ferrari, which isn't actually practical as a daily car anyways.  And the Ferrari having a bunch of upsells to make it workable. I wrote a long list of pros/cons of this scooter.  I no longer feel like rewriting it.  This thing is basically a scam. I tried to be optimistic about its design being safe, but I'm seeing now that it's clearly not for safety.  Just upselling tactics with deliberately bad design or gimping its power. I really don't get how this got a Red Dot Design award over the Xiaomi, who at the very least fostered a modding community to fix all the problems. The grip tape and the form factor encouraging damaging your skin and clothes on contact due to poor design and things like the really annoying folding lever, on top of all the other problems. The designers made it almost impossible to test it without damaging it, by deliberately making it so that you would damage it and force an upsell. Don't buy this unit, and I would recommend not buying anything from Segway. I gave it 2-stars because it's still usable and reasonably comfortable to ride.

If they can't help with the cookie cutter stuff, they just tell you to mail it to their ""local"" facility (1,500 miles away from me) for further evaluation rather than give a technician (like me) the proper information and spare parts I asked for for me to just take care of this myself....it's just a few screws and quick disconnect wires folks....ain't that hard. But I suppose I can't blame them too much for trying to drive business (aka $) back to their company, and for adhering to their lawyer's liability policy. Ugh. The takeaway, spend the extra money for the product line that they actually support and have spare parts on the shelf for. You get what you pay for.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on September 2, 2022"

"I purchased 2 Segway scooters for Christmas 2020. I live in Massachusetts, so riding them wasn't a plan until spring. However, we got a nice day, in the high 40s, so we took them out for a 10 minute spin early January. In that time, the fender/braking system snapped off of one of the scooters. I chatted into Segway on January 14th. The person I chatted with said the scooter is under warranty and the part would be shipped to me within 20 days. I also provided the rep with 4 pictures of the broken fender/brake. Its now 2 months and 2 weeks later and I still have no part. I have called Segway 3 times. I have email them maybe 12 times. I requested a supervisor (Jace) to get involved. He stated my trouble ticket would be assigned to him....but still no resolve. The communication from the Segway representatives have been terrible. No one emails me updates. No one makes contact with me unless I chase them. I have asked if the part is no longer being manufactured...no one knows the answer to that question. It was suggested that a used part may need to be obtained and then shipped to me for repair. I asked about an exchange...it was also suggested the if that was approved, a refurbished scooter is what I would receive...not a new one. I feel thats a bogus resolution. I sent another email this morning with my purchase receipt, requesting a full refund. Because the scooter is under warranty, Jace (the supervisor) from Segway said a box and label would be sent to me. When I purchased these scooters, I felt comforted that the company I was purchasing from was reputable. I now know that their customer service processes are garbage and I am warning anyone looking to purchase from Segway.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on March 30, 2021"

"Got this as a gift for my daughter. First thing you need to know if you are buying in America: It shows the speed in KMH, not MPH, and there is no way to change that. There's an app available, but this specific model cannot connect to that. I researched a bit and it seems like previous versions did, and that's how you update the KMH/MPH thing, but they cut that to save on cost at some point. I doin't know if I definitely would have bought a different one knowing that, but I really might have. As for the scooter, it has been fine otherwise so far.

"This is perfect if you're looking for a lightweight reliable scooter. It only weighs 25 lbs so you can carry it up subway steps easily. The top speed and battery life take a small hit for that but it's a tradeoff. If you're looking for something faster with better battery, it's going to be heavier. I use it to make short trips around NYC and it is perfect for that. I didn't know how bad I needed one until I got it. Now I can zoom down to a to-go restaurant with the scooter and I don't even have to lock it up because it's so small. It doesn't take up any more space than you do when you're standing up. I've had it for about 3 months and have had no problems with it. It seems very reliable. I love this thing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on June 30, 2021"

Also when there’s like 15% of battery left it goes veeery slow, same speed as fast walking. Works great for my commute in NYC. Rides smoothly through most of the road bumps. Not too bulky and not heavy at all so I’m able to take it on to the bus. The only downside is that it seems to lose the battery capacity - when I got it a month ago I was able to make 3 trips on full battery and I still had some battery life left and now it’s just enough for my 3 trips.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on September 4, 2022"
"Pros - good battery life - 3 speeds.  kids use the lowest speeds fine. Adults can use faster speeds. - folds easily - looks color and modern - good build quality cons: - quiet heavy and often bangs my legs when I pick it up and it rotates freely - pretty wide and take up a lot of room on my Honda Odyssey. - when folded and standing up on front wheel, it is unstable. Not good for bus trips. - parts (i.e. new battery, brakes,  seat, etc.) will be expensive to replace. - can handle minor bumps on the road only. would not handle pot holes nor bigger holes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on May 11, 2021"

In this regard, it is significantly better than the two, similarly-priced, Yonos K-9 electric scooters I had owned prior to this Segway Ninebot e-scooter. This Segway has a bit lower top-end speed than my previous e-scooters. It takes a little bit more kick to get it going, especially on a rising grade.

"I will be glad to update this review if I can get a fix for my ninebot scooter.  Bought it last October.  Assembly was easy.  Put it on the charger overnight - but it never really hit 100%.  Rode it one time and then the weather was too cold.  Stored it in the house (no cold temps).  Got it out a couple of weeks ago to ride it - charged it again overnight, never got to 100%.  Rode it for a bit one day, then plugged in the charger.  Appears to not charge at all or really slowly with the scooter powered off, so I powered on and charged it.  24 hours later still only 88% charged, per the scooter readout.  What am I missing?  I'm way past the return date, and it was a little expensive to just toss it.  Maybe someone reading this or the manufacturer can tell me how to get it to charge in a few hours (cause if it was for commuting, it would have to recharge in a reasonable amount of time), or how to get it to charge to 100%?

"I wanted to get something to keep up with my kids. This has the needed power for someone over 200lbs. It has three settings, had to read the manual to understand the symbols. It's not hard to understand but a simple 123 seems like it would have been easier to remember if I don't use it for a few months. Not a huge deal I'm probably nitpicking there. The scooter has a nice rough board so I'm not worried about slipping which is nice. It folds which I also really like. Plus it folds really easily and opens back up really easy, big pro on that one. The low power setting for my size is not enough to get me up of an incline but is just right for flat roads. I find I have to switch back and forth. I assume as I get a hang if it I won't use the low speed. The last thing worth mentioning that is kind of a big deal is the fully electronic break. It's very easy to fall if I'm not careful. I worry in an emergency it will just make me stop too fast and go flying. I've seen a few models with both kind of breaks. I didn't understand it until trying this one. Something to keep in mind.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on May 16, 2022"

"this is really great to-go scooter, it's so lightweight compared to other electric scooter but still fast and fun * Build Quality & Design * Good quality throughout with some minor hiccups. Speed and brake lever feels a bit cheaply made plastic. Screen is nice and clear and have some colors.  The hand grips feel like they will peel after short use and not very comfortable. The lights works nice but switching them on is not vert intuitive. There is a kickstand so you won't need to lay this on the ground when not in used and the top of the board is sanded for extra grip and reassurance when riding. The charging port is found on the main pole where the battery is located. The battery in the pole makes it a bit bulky but nothing noticeable when you ride it. Folding mechanism is easy to use with just one click. * Assembly * Basically, plug the little cords together and tighten 6 screws with the included tool and you are good to go. 5 minutes! Really simple. * Operation * Nothing new here kick and press the throttle and you will be on your way. 3 modes economy, standard and sport. where the visual only distinction between standard and sport is a white icon and a red icon. to break you will have two options (other then just let go of the throttle), you can either use the door brake (manual) or the electronic front hand (well more finger) brake. The main issue with the electronic brake is the lack of feedback. I much rather have a proper manual brake lever as this might be a cause of a crash, specially as this is the front brake. The overall ride experience is pretty smooth and comfortable. The flat-free hollow tires are surprisingly good and the front shock provide some relief from bumps. There is only one button to control all the functionality, on/off, mode selection and lights on/off. Pros: Lightweight, Smooth Ride, Range, Design Cons: Grips, Electronic Brake, One button control, Speed? Even with the minor hiccups, It's a rather fun electric scooter that is easy to carry around and load and unload from your car or public transport. It offers a good range and smooth ride in a reasonable price","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on December 6, 2020"
"I wish it wasn't the middle of winter because I would be using it a lot more. I was extremely nervous the first time I tried it because I am extremely clumsy, so I was expecting to be terrible at it, but it is so easy to ride. Very seamless. You just kick off a couple times with your foot and off you go. You can use the front brake or the back brake that you step on to slow the scooter, so it's nice to have both options. I am just a touch over the weight limit as well and it carries me with no problems. I probably don't get as good of a battery life as a skinny person, but it still lasts me a good long while. It can MOVE too. Quite quickly, which is why I immediately ordered a helmet/pads to wear when I am using it. I don't want to hurt myself too badly if I wear to go flying off/have a collision while at the higher speeds. My daughter has the kids version of this one and it's so much fun to ride together. Great bonding time. I love this thing. My one complaint- the little part that you stick in to attach the handlebars to the rest of the scooter was a PAIN IN THE REAR. Seriously. I had to have 2 other people help me with it and then ended up having to adjust the pins that were completely out of whack. I watched youtube videos just to see if I was going crazy and they had a seamless time of it, but mine, the pins were NOT lined up where they were supposed to be, so it was a chore to get together. I was very close to giving up on it and chucking in in the landfill, but glad I persisted. But it was a huge, giant headache.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on December 6, 2020"

"When I visited Miami last year, I saw these (or similar ones) all over the place. I think they're owned by Uber and you can rent them for travel out and about. I actually live in a Texan suburb so while I couldn't use this for commuting (even though I'm working from home), I DO use it to go out and about. I make it to the CVS (a 13 minute walk) in less than 5 minutes. It's such a better alternative than having to start up my car and drive short distances, both from a gas/mileage standpoint and environmentally speaking. This is a beautifully designed scooter with the orange standing out and making it visible for drivers on the road. Future iterations of this could also include glow in the dark orange paint for riding it in darker conditions, but the headlight does address visibility issues both for the scooter as you navigate in front of you and for onlookers to avoid hitting you. It holds a charge remarkably well - have only had to do a full recharge  ONCE after three weeks of using it to go out and about.  The controls are very easy to navigate as well, with the brake on the left handlebar and accelerator on the right. It feels smooth and easy while you're on it, and the scooter shifts alongside your body as you turn corners.  It's very easy to store as you can fold it up and put it away. This is just SO easy and simple to use, straight out of the box and every day thereafter. If you're looking for a scooter, this is the one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on December 4, 2020"

"I have been seeking a way to kick the Covid-blue and this Segway scooter is perfect for that purpose.  I will tell you, it is virtually impossible to be unhappy while riding around on this thing. Assembly is easy and took about 5 minutes.  The handlebars come disconnected.  Just connect them and you are off and running.  The speed is pretty good at a consistent 12.4 mph.  I haven't maxed out the distance but it appears to be a consistent with the specs at just over 12 miles.  It doesn't fold up super small but small enough for a commuter train.  It is also only 20 lbs so you can transport it easily. The ride is smooth and operation is super easy.  This is a kick start scooter so you need to get up over a couple miles per hour on your own before the electronic motor kicks in.  Just kick start like a regular non-electric scooter and hold down the lever control.  There are two options for braking which is handy.  The handlebar brake is a small lever but there is also a brake on the back wheel. This scooter is so much fun!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on January 18, 2021"
"Battery life test in real world conditions with hills , higher speeds and bumps is about 60% of what is advertised. Don't let that stop you though if you don't need a long range... This is a really perfect & stable scooter for most people. I rode it all day and had no issues with performance or quality. A warning though, be careful going over  driveway lips or small potholes. I wiped out on my first ride because I did not slow my speed and approached the driveway (that wasn't 100% level to the street) at an angle. That's really the only thing to be concerned about. I love this scooter and so does most people I ride past 😁. Also another note: the top speed of  12 mph feels like biking at 25 mph. This is my first scooter so I don't have much reference, but I would not want to go much faster. The ninebot max with 18 mph top speed would be the most I would ever need. Hard to believe people are riding scooters going 40-60mph. Stay safe.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on December 31, 2020"
"The ES1L scooter is a new model from Segway with a slightly lower top speed and less range than some of their other models, but at a significantly lower price.  You cannot connect it to your phone like you can with some Segway products (Like the Segway miniPRO that I also have).  But for the price, it is an excellent value and still maintains the high level of quality that you normally find in all Segway products. It has a top speed of 12.4 mph and a maximum range of 12.4 miles, and the maximum weight it can handle is 220 pounds.  Of course if you are always operating it at the highest speed, the range will suffer. I think this is a perfect scooter to use for commuting in the downtown area of a big city.  It is also useful for keeping in the back of your car and using when you are at a park or another place you are visiting where it's not convenient to drive, but you also don't feel like walking.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on December 3, 2020"

"The Segway Ninebots are great scooters, and this is one of the more entry level ones.  The downside is primarily the speed/motor on it, while still good just a bit slower.

Folds up, nice kickstand, controls are easy to use and I like the color accents.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on April 27, 2021"

"I now own two of these (different brands) so I can make a solid comparison between the two and this one definitely falls short in the most important categories. The listing claims that it has a max speed of 20 km/h, but I haven't been able to get it to go over 16 km/h even at full charge. That's a 20% decrease in performance which is VERY apparent. My other electric scooter can go up to 25 km/h which makes for a much more enjoyable ride. This thing feels pretty slow unfortunately. Other than the speed performance, this thing handles well, has a nice sleek design, and the headlight is very bright. Holds a charge for a good amount of time, but I haven't put it to the test enough to speak too in depth on the battery life. Overall it's still fun to ride, but I wish the speed performance was as advertised.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on December 23, 2020"

"This was my first electric scooter. It’s a nice “entry-level” scooter if you don’t want to spend thousands on something you are not sure how often you will use it. After trying this one out, I may go for a slightly higher grade model next time. I would buy from the same manufacturer since I think this is great quality for the price. I like how light weight it is so I can take it to the grocery store and put it in the cart while I do my shopping. I also bought a shoulder strap so I can carry it when not riding, but although it’s light weight, it’s still nearly 25lbs and still quite long folded up so it’s not really practical to be walking down store aisles with it on your shoulder even if you can. Speed: I think the description says 15mph, I can go up to 20mph on level ground, got it up to 26 downhill. I am 6 ft 200lbs so I think someone lighter might go a little faster on flat land. Also if you are a little smaller it may not feel as “light weight”. Headlight: I thought this would be a weak light that shines so others can see you, but it actually illuminated the road well. My plan is not to ride at night but sometimes you get caught out later than expected and it’s a nice feature to have. Charge: the charge lasts a while. I haven’t yet tested it the full distance but it seems like it will go as stated. I’ll update if the battery dies quickly over time.  If I were to buy again I will research replacement batteries. I didn’t for this scooter so I don’t know if the replacement options are good or bad, but I think it would be good to have a spare battery. Negatives: Hills: not a true negative as it will for up the incline stated in the description fine, and maybe even slightly more than that… but that is a low incline. Just don’t expect it to go up a steep hill. I live near the coast so I am on mostly flat land, I just have a hill when I leave the costal area. It’s not a big deal if you get good momentum at the bottom you can get up part of the hill and then kick your way up, but you may be disappointed if you live in the mountains.  I’ll see if I can find the slope of a hill and update later. Shocks: it hits bumps really hard, if you have a sidewalk that isn’t level, say a 3/4 inch bump, you really feel it. This may be due to the tires not being inflatable. That is a trade off I guess I am willing to make because the positive is you don’t get flats. This seems more like a trade off you need to evaluate for yourself rather than a negative so I didn’t reduce star rating. Just know if you have really bad roads you may want to get a scooter with different shocks or tires.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on December 15, 2021"
"So I purchased this scooter to go to work and save the money I use for monthly Metrocards. So far, it's really not bad. I like the three different modes, normally I only use the moderate and sports mode.  The light is great and really bright for the early mornings. But the battery life sucks. My job is 3miles away with only 2 hills so about 6 miles in total a day for 5 days a week. By the time I get to work, the battery is at 48%. Coming home is a little less- at 55-60% and I think it could definitely be that the light drains the battery. I weigh 170 and carry a light backpack so idk if the weight plays a role as well or what not. Whatever. I like it though, its my first scooter and has definitely opened my eyes to looking into scooters instead of cars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on November 6, 2021"

I always use it to go to the store, pickup something, bart, and just for fun too! Really handy & very fun, great purchase!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on January 20, 2021"
"I use the scooter to commute around town when I dont want to use my car. Overall this has done more than a great job getting me from point A to B. The battery will last a good 4 or 5 round trips. My only complaints are 1) that there doesn't appear to be a way to switch the speedometer from kmph to mph and 2) there isnt any difference in top speed between standard and sport mode. The only time I could tell a difference is when I was going uphill. It certainly has more torque, but not more top speed. Great product, high quality materials, and the assembly was easy with the included allen key","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on July 1, 2021"

"It looks exactly like it does in the picture. Its handlebars are a little below my shoulder height (I'm 5' 0""). The assembly wasn't difficult. There are six screws with very obvious holes and a tool to help screw them in. They don't have to be screwed in super tightly, but enough to keep the handlebars firm. It's a little bumpy riding on surfaces that aren't very smooth so you can feel the different pieces of pavement as you ride over it. As expected, it struggles on any hill that is somewhat steep. I find it helps to just push it along with my foot (like a regular scooter) while also using the power for hills. It took a while to charge the first time, a few hours. It rode well and displays your speed in km (not miles) and shows the battery life. It is my second day having it so I will update this review if things go badly. Update: This is my first week of having it. I ride it about 4-5 miles a day back and forth to school. The scooter carries about in the 150lbs range when I ride it, once you add in the back pack and huge textbooks. This distance (including a steep hill for the last few hundred feet of the trip) takes a little less than half of the battery displayed. Update: I'm now two months in and it still handles great! I'm not sure if other people have gotten an off chance dud, but I have been very satisfied with mine.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on August 25, 2021"

"Out of the box it came fairly charged which was nice. Assembly was simple, only being the top section which luckily has a tool provided for the screws. And, the controls are very simple, along with a nice screen to show off settings, speed, etc. Also, despite me most likely not going to use it a lot, it does come with an toggleable light on it. A very great scooter.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on May 11, 2022"

"Always wanted an electric scooter as a kid but finally I got one at a good price this scooter is amazingly lightweight easy to ride with good tires and range. I actually went up to the hiking trails with it and rode all the way back down. A bit scary but the most fun I have had yet, I ride it everywhere when I’m stressed and need to leave the house.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on August 3, 2022"
"So much fun and well built. It charges quickly and had a % charge level. I haven’t been able to change the km to mi on the display. It has a decent battery life but not nearly 12 miles claim range even in economy mode. If you weight 100 pounds that may be true but I got around 7 or 8 miles. There is very little difference in Sport and Standard mode as far as I can tell. It was comfortable enough but you can feel everything.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on May 21, 2022"

"I’m 76 but adventurous. I’ve tried a couple of rental scooters and enjoy the experience. I weigh 200. After my first spill I bought all the safety equipment. There is an element of inherent danger to consider. That said, I am having a huge amount of fun with this. A little practice and I get better each time. Yes, it doesn’t go really fast, just fast enough for me. As a first scooter it is a great buy and durable too. Setup was incredibly easy and fast. While it isn’t tremendously light or really compact I have nothing to compare it to Its easy to load in my car trunk but not light or compact enough to easily travel with it","5.0 out of 5 stars","Reviewed in the United States on June 27, 2022"

"Antes de comprar este producto hice investigaciones de marcas reviews etc.. comprando el producto uno entiende todos los problemas que con lleva, que si la batería no le dura lo suficiente, que si las llantas se rompen o que son inflables, etc. yo compre el scooter literalmente para “dominguear” no como medio de transporte ya que la ciudad no está apta para usarlo en la calle con tránsito de carros, para lo que yo lo necesito es un producto excelente, si tú necesitas el scooter como medio de transporte utilizarlo a diario etc.. mejor busca otro review de alguien que lo utilice para eso , para lo que yo lo necesito funciona perfectamente y soy muy feliz con el, no pesa así que lo puedo traer de un lugar a otro sin problemas, no lo he utilizado en pendientes siempre en plano, disfruto mucho los paseos","","Reviewed in Mexico on March 20, 2022"

"Creo que conforme pasa el tiempo más me gusta este chunche. Es ágil y tiene tres modos de conducción que lo pueden volver bastante veloz. En el modo más lento la duración de la batería es buena aunque creo que lo siguiente será adquirir una batería extra exterior. Lo de las ruedas imponchables compensa el tener que recibir todas las rugosidades del camino. Su lámpara frontal es muy buena para iluminar el camino aunque obviamente reduce la carga de la batería. Lo volvería a comprar.","","Reviewed in Mexico on April 13, 2022"

"While this scooter is functional and great in many ways do not think that this is a equal alternative to the regular flagship models. This model is quite a bit smaller and shorter and on other websites is actually advertised for teens and not labeled as a adult sized scooter. Secondly my scooter had a defect with the break and accelerator buttons, and trying to return it to Amazon has been a nightmare. I strongly suggest you think carefully before purchasing this model and do not rely on your prime membership or Amazon usual hassle free returns if you plan to buy this.","","Reviewed in Canada 🇨🇦 on September 6, 2022"
"This was my very first time getting into the e-scooter market. I gotta say I was quite impressed with the results. Folding is super simple and has never given me trouble at all. Assembly was super quick and easy. One thing I really like about this particular model compared to other e-scooters in general is that there are NO exposed wires at all and I appreciate the thumb brake control similar to the throttle control compared to the standard handlebar brake you see on bikes and most other scooters. Brakes were always responsive and acceleration was fairly quick with no issues. As for speed, it was my first e-scooter so I'm going to be generous and say that it was pretty decent. I'm a bit on the heavier side and I was still able to get the advertised speed of 20km/hr (12mph) on Standard mode. I wasn't trying to die as a beginner e-scooter rider and in my area (Mississauga, Ontario) e-scooters have a speed limit of 24 km/hr. This isn't a scooter for someone who wants to go extremely fast or catch the wind unless you're going down a slope. One thing I will warn about is DO NOT use Sport mode which is the highest of the three settings. It doesn't make it go any faster and it will drain your battery sooner. Only use Sport mode to assist going up slopes or if you wanna rip down slopes. As for range. It's advertised as 20 km (12.4 miles). From experience, time-wise on Standard mode, I'd always get up to around an hour of use before the battery starts to really run out. Mileage wise, I tend to get around 13 km (8 miles) max using Standard mode. Although I think using the headlight at night will kinda make the battery drain a bit faster.  This is good for short to mid range commuting but not for those who want a longer ride. I live only about a kilometre away from work and I often used it to commute and it was great. In love how it's so easy to fold and store away. I just told it up and store it at my workplace break room. I appreciate the sleek yet minimalistic design and the orange outlines on the back wheel cover and handlebars give it a nice colorful touch. My one major complaint would be the price for what you're paying, especially compared to the competition. I got mine for $550 CAD (before tax). I feel other scooters such as the Gyrocopters Flash 3.0 and Gotrax Apex XL provide higher speed and range at a lower price. This world hurt this model's competitiveness. While this scooter's features are pretty good, I in all honesty cannot recommend this scooter. The sole reason being this is a bit overpriced for what it does. For a budget, entry level scooter, I'd recommend either the Gyrocopters Flash 3.0 or the Gotrax GXL V2. Both are under $500 CAD. For mid-range options, I'd recommend the Gotrax Apex XL or the upgraded version, the Gotrax XR Ultra, both of which run under $600 CAD (after coupon discounts, which pop up often).","","Reviewed in Canada 🇨🇦 on August 30, 2022"
